While we have tasked experts from around the world to provide insight into the latest knowledge on common topics within pediatric urology, we have also tried to think outside the box by having experts also weight on such topics as regional perspectives on differences of sexual development, surgical leadership, and what our specialty might look like in the year 2050.\n\nWe plan to have the book translated into Spanish and potentially other languages soon (2023).\n\nThe editors are especially grateful to our predecessors, Christopher Cooper, Prasad Godbole, and Duncan Wilcox, for their innovation in starting this online and freely available textbook of pediatric urology. In an era where academic medicine often feels beholden to a publishing system whose interests do not always align with those of the authors of manuscripts, book chapters, reviews, and commentary, Copper, Godbole, and Wilcox sought to buck that system and created the first iteration of this free online book and published it in 2010 for all to use. It regularly receives up to 15,000 unique visitors per month from around the world. Version 1 was translated into Spanish in 2020, further expanding its impact. Many people in and out of the medical field in all roles have used this resource to aid in the care of patients, family members, and themselves. The editors of version 2 have endeavored to maintain this spirit of openness by updating the content, while modernizing the look and feel.\n\nWe would like to extend a heart-felt thank you to our liaison editor, Amrita Mohanty, who between medical school classes and clinical rotations, served as a vital organizer, arranging editorial meetings and helping to communicate with all the authors.\n\nThe editors would also like to thank our families. Editing a book is without a doubt a big lift—late nights, early mornings, missed outings, Sunday editorial meetings. Their love and willingness to share our time has made this a great resource for trainees, pediatric urologists, families and patients around the world.\n\nWe hope you find version 2 as much of a resource as we did version 1! Please feel free to reach out to us with any suggestions or comments. We hope this is a living resource that can be updated as new medical knowledge comes to light.\n\nAll our best,\nAngela Arlen, Mohan Gundeti, Pedro-José López, &amp; Kyle Rove\n",

        "title": "Embryology of Urinary Tract",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nDespite the functional differences between the urinary tract and the reproductive system, the embryologic origins and development of these systems are integrated with one another. The urinary tract is comprised of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. This system functions to excrete waste and maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. The kidneys also produce hormones that regulate blood pressure, erythropoietin production, and vitamin D synthesis. The genital system is composed of gonads, reproductive tracts, and external genitalia. This system synthesizes and receives hormones for growth and development, produces and transports spermatozoa and oocytes, and, in females, sustains and supports fetal development.\n\nAn understanding of the embryologic development of the genitourinary tract provides a foundation for understanding the anatomic and physiologic function of these organs as well as the pathophysiology of maldeveloped structures. While embryology pertaining to various genitourinary conditions are provided in detail in other chapters, the purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the embryology for the genitourinary tract.\n\nIn this overview, we use “male” to refer to the internal and external genitalia that are most typically seen in persons with the 46,XY genotype and “female” to refer to the internal and external genitalia that are most typically seen in persons with the 46,XX genotype.\n\nKidneys and Upper Urinary Tract\n\nKidney and upper urinary tract development progresses through the proposed stages of the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros (Figure 1) The development of each renal unit ultimately gives rise to the functional renal parenchyma (comprised of about 250,000 to 3 million nephrons1,2), and the collecting system: minor and major calyces, renal pelvis, and ureter.\n\n\nFigure 1 Developmental stages of the kidney and upper urinary tract. The kidney progresses through the pronephros at week 3 (green), mesonephros starting at week 4 (blue), and metanephros starting at week 5 of gestation. As the mesonephros attaches to the cloaca, the ureteric bud (orange) arises adjacent to this junction and fuses with the metanephric blastema (maroon).\n\nIn week 3 of gestation, intermediate mesoderm in the cervical and upper thoracic regions condenses to form the pronephros. The pronephros is a primitive and non-functional structure of hollow spheres of tissue and apparently serves a transient role in the embryologic development of the kidney. The pronephric ducts extend caudally to give rise to the mesonephric ducts and degenerate by the end of the fourth week of gestation. Through the concept that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny (i.e. embryologic development progresses through points of species evolution), the transient role of the human pronephros is proposed through its function in the embryologic kidney of various chordates.3 However, little is known about the human pronephros and pronephric structures were not detectable on evaluation of human embryos at 3-4 weeks of development.3\n\nThe mesonephros arises at the level of the thoracic vertebra at approximately 4 weeks of gestation.3 Toward the end of the fourth week, the mesonephros extends caudally to attach to the cloaca. The mesonephros functions as a primitive kidney that filters blood through tubules. Although tubules degenerate and the mesonephros shrinks relative to the size of the growing embryo, the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts persist bilaterally and contribute further to urinary tract development (bladder trigone and ureters) and the male reproductive tract (vas deferens, epididymis, seminal vesicle, appendix epididymis).4\n\nAfter the mesonephros attaches to the cloaca, the ureteric bud arises from the distal posterior mesonephric duct near its junction with the cloaca at week 5 of gestation.3 The metanephric blastema concurrently arises as a mass of mesenchymal tissue aggregated from intermediate mesoderm. Together, the ureteric bud and metanephric blastema form the metanephros, which is the final stage in kidney and upper tract development. The metanephric blastema and ureteric bud co-induce one another to develop: the metanephric blastema encapsulates and fuses with the ureteric bud and the ureteric bud penetrates the metanephric blastema and starts bifurcating. As the ureteric bud elongates to form the ureter, it bifurcates to form the renal pelvis and major calyces, which then branch to form minor calyces, the renal pyramid, and ultimately the collecting tubes of the nephron (Figure 2) Meanwhile, as the ureteric bud elongates and bifurcates, the metanephric blastema forms nephron structures (Figure 3) Vascular endothelial growth factor-2 (VEGF-2) initiates vascularization at the metanephric blastema.5 Excretory S-shaped tubules acquire capillaries to form glomeruli that each have an encapsulating Bowman’s capsule. These excretory tubules lengthen to form the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule. The distal convoluted tubule joins with the collecting duct (from the ureteric bud) to form the nephron.\n\n\nFigure 2 Ureteric bud. The ureteric bud elongates and branches to form the renal pelvis, major and minor calyces, and collecting duct of the nephron.\n\n\nFigure 3 Nephron development. Excretory S-shaped tubules (purple; from metanephric blastema) acquire capillaries to form glomeruli, elongate to form the proximal and distal tubules and loops of Henle, and join with collecting ducts from the ureteric bud (orange; from mesonephric ducts) to ultimately form nephrons.\n\nThe ureteric bud and metanephric blastema reciprocally induce growth through various molecular factors and interactions that contribute to the development of the metanephros. Bone morphogenetic protein BMP-4 is expressed in the mesenchyme and serves dual functions to inhibit ureteric budding and promote ureteral elongation.6 Local expression of BMP-antagonist gremlin (grem1) allows for ureteral budding to initiate.6,7 After ureteric budding initiation, BMP-4 subsequently promotes elongation and appears to be involved in promoting the development of periureteral smooth muscle.6,8 BMP-7, from the metanephric blastema and ureteric bud, maintains and sensitizes nephron progenitors to ureteric bud signaling.6 The metanephric blastema secretes glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) that also induces the ureteric bud to branch and elongate.9 Glycoprotein WNT11 is expressed at the tip of the branching ureteric bud and helps maintain expression of GDNF.10,11 There is reciprocal interaction between WNT11, GDNF, and the RET tyrosine kinase receptor in metanephros development as WNT11 and RET mutations result in branching defects and renal hypoplasia.11 Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands and their corresponding receptors (FGFR) also contribute to metanephric mesenchymal patterning, induction of the ureteric bud, ureteric bud branching, and nephrogenesis.12 Furthermore, direct contact with mesenchyme also promotes ureteric bud elongation and branching pattern.13\n\nThe metanephros develops into the functional and anatomically positioned kidney with early urine production, renal ascension and revascularization, and renal rotation. Fetal urine production starts at week 10-11 of gestation and becomes the predominant component of amniotic fluid.14 The kidneys are initially in close proximity to each other in the sacral region of the embryo.15,16 As the embryo grows longitudinally, each kidney ascends at weeks 6-9 from its initial pelvic location to the upper retroperitoneum at the lower thoracic and upper lumbar region (Figure 4) Transient blood vessels develop and degenerate as the kidneys ascend until they reach their final destination in the upper retroperitoneum and the definitive renal arteries and veins develop. The kidneys rotate so that the renal pelvis moves from an anterior to medial orientation.16\n\n\nFigure 4 Renal ascent. The developing kidney ascends from its pelvic location to the upper retroperitoneum.\n\nKey Points\n\nThe developing kidney and upper urinary tract develop through the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros stages. The metanephros is comprised of the metanephric blastema and ureteric bud that respectively develop into the renal parenchyma and collecting system. The mesonephros persists and contributes to the development of the bladder trigone, upper tract collecting system, and the male reproductive system.\n\nLower Urinary Tract\n\nThe cloaca acts as a common chamber for the urogenital and anorectal tracts as it connects to the allantois (yolk sac) and the hindgut. It is a combination of ectoderm lined by endoderm that opens at a single orifice at the caudal aspect of the developing embryo. As the mesonephros attaches to the cloaca and the upper urinary tract develops as the metanephros, the lower urinary tract develops from the cloaca to form the bladder and urethra.\n\nAt approximately week 7 of gestation, the urorectal septum grows caudally, separating the cloaca into the anterior urogenital sinus and the posterior anorectal canal, and ultimately becomes the perineal body (Figure 5)17 The urogenital sinus then subdivides cranially and caudally to form the respective bladder and urethra.\n\n\nFigure 5 Cloacal division. The urorectal septum divides the cloaca into the urogenital sinus and the anorectal canal. The urorectal septum then develops into the perineal body.\n\nThe cranial aspect of the urogenital sinus enlarges and becomes the bladder that is initially continuous with the allantois (Figure 6) While the endoderm of the former cloaca gives rise to the urothelial lining of the bladder.18 differentiation of bladder smooth muscle relies upon mesenchymal-epithelial interactions.19 The mesonephric duct that had previously attached to the cloaca remains attached to the developing bladder; it regresses and is absorbed caudally into the bladder trigone and ureteral orifices. Vitamin A-induced apoptosis of the mesonephric ducts, interactions between the bladder and ureteral smooth muscle, and endodermal origins are other proposed mechanisms contributing to trigonal development.20,21,22\n\n\nFigure 6 Bladder development. The cranial aspect of the urogenital sinus enlarges to become the bladder. The mesonephric duct (blue) regresses and is absorbed into the bladder trigone and ureteral orifices. Meanwhile, the allantois involutes and becomes the urachus, which then becomes more fibrotic as the median umbilical ligament.\n\nThe remainder of the mesonephric ducts subsequently develop into the male reproductive tract (discussed in the gonads and reproductive tracts section). Products of the mesonephric ducts move further apart as the embryo continues to grow: the ureteral orifices move craniolaterally as the male reproductive tracts move caudally and medially. Displacement of the ureteric bud relative to the location of the mesonephric duct can affect the ultimate location of the ureteral orifice and the development of the respective kidney.23,24 Milder displacement can result in a craniolateral or caudomedial position of the ureteral orifice whereas severe displacement can result in an ectopic ureter inserting outside of the bladder and/or renal dysplasia.23,24\n\nAs the bladder develops, the allantois involutes and becomes the urachus that connects the dome of the bladder with the umbilicus. After birth, the urachal remnant becomes more fibrotic and becomes the median umbilical ligament.25\n\nThe inferocaudal aspect of the urogenital sinus forms the prostatic and membranous urethra in males and urethra and vaginal vestibule in females.25 Similar to the bladder, the urothelial lining of the urethra is derived from endoderm.18 In males, the urogenital sinus extends to the genital tubercle to form the prostatic and membranous urethra whereas its associated urogenital folds form the penile urethra.18,26 Further branching and outgrowths from the prostatic urethra form the prostatic glands at approximately 9-10 weeks of gestation.27 The prostate stroma arises from the mesenchyme and develops under the influence of androgens and paracrine signaling from multiple factors, including FGF, sonic hedgehog (SHH), transcription factor Nkx3.1, homeobox (HOX) genes, forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors, SRY-box transcription factor (SOX-9), BMP, and WNT.27,28,29,30,31 While testosterone can contribute to prostatic development, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) has a much more potent effect on the prostate.27 Prostatic mesenchyme forms stromal tissue and the smooth muscle surrounding prostatic glands and ducts. The bulbourethral (Cowper’s) glands in males form by budding from the urethra. The penile urethra is formed when the urethral plate tubularizes18,26 (discussed in the external genitalia section). Development of the glanular portion of the urethra is debated at this time and may form from tubularization with subsequent endodermal differentiation into squamous epithelium based on more recent studies.18,32,33\n\nIn females, the urogenital sinus forms the entire urethra and the distal vagina. Homologous to the male prostatic glands, the cranial aspect of the urethra forms the paraurethral (Skene’s) glands. Homologous to the male bulbourethral (Cowper’s) glands, Bartholin’s glands form by budding from the urethra.\n\nKey Points\n\nThe cloaca is initially a common chamber that is divided by the urorectal septum to form the urogenital sinus and the anorectal canal. The urogenital sinus subsequently enlarges cranially to form the bladder and contributes to the urethra in both sexes. The allantois concurrently involutes to form the urachus, which later becomes the median umbilical ligament.\n\nGonads and Reproductive Tracts\n\nThe gonads and internal reproductive tract of male and female sexes are initially undifferentiated. Influence from genetic and hormonal factors determine development to form either the testes and associated mesonephric (Wolffian) structures or ovaries and associated paramesonephric (Müllerian) structures.\n\nDuring week 5 of gestation, proliferation and condensation of the germinal epithelium and mesenchyme form the gonadal ridge adjacent to the mesonephros. Primordial germ cells are incorporated with clusters of epithelium called sex cords. The sex cords invaginate local mesenchymal tissue and enable migration of the primordial germ cells through yolk sac cavity to the gonadal ridge at 6 weeks.34 As germ cells and sex cords cluster together at the gonadal ridge, cortical and medullary regions of the gonad develop.35,36 Factors WNT4 and SOX-9 are expressed at the gonadal ridges and vary in their expression in human sex determination.37 Gonad formation is also regulated by transcription factors including Wilms tumor 1 (WT1), LIM homeobox 9 (LHX9), and steroidogenesis factor 1 (SF1).38\n\nThe undifferentiated gonads are bipotential (Figure 7) and the primordial germ cells have the ability develop into spermatogonia in males or oogonia in females until the seventh week of gestation.38 Mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts and paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts are also bipotential at this point.\n\n\nFigure 7 Gonadal differentiation. The gonad (pink) typically differentiates into either the testis with corresponding mesonephric duct structures (blue) or the ovary with corresponding paramesonephric duct structures (purple).\n\nThe Male Gonad and Reproductive Tract\n\nIn males, the undifferentiated gonad develops into the testis and the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts develop into the epididymis, appendix epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct.\n\nThe SRY (sex-determining region of the Y-chromosome) gene (also known as testis-determining factor [TDF]) is located on the short arm of the Y chromosome at Yp11.3 and initiates male sex differentiation.39,40 The corresponding SRY protein and transcription factors from SOX-9, DAX-1, WT1, and SF1 genes influence gonadal differentiation,.% cite mcelreavey1995a vilain1998a –file 01-01 %} SRY has been found to upregulate SOX-9 to activate expression of SF1 and promote the differentiation of Sertoli and Leydig cells.37,41,42 The primitive gonadal sex cords organize into the rete testis and seminiferous cords. Sertoli cells and Leydig cells develop between the seminiferous cords and initiate hormone production that promote male differentiation (discussed below). The tunica albuginea encapsulates these cords to form the testicle. The seminiferous cords eventually develop a lumen and become the seminiferous tubules at puberty.\n\nSertoli and Leydig cells subsequently begin testicular hormone production that results in a cascade of masculinization processes. Sertoli cells secrete Müllerian-inhibiting factor (MIF) or anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) under the influence of SOX-9, SF1, WT1, and DAX1 as well as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).43 Anti-Müllerian hormone subsequently causes the degeneration of the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts, with remnants being the appendix testis and prostatic utricle.40,43,44 SOX-9 and SF1 interact to increase the effect of AMH to cause Müllerian regression. Leydig cells concurrently respond to luteinizing hormone (LH) and analogously structured human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to initiate testosterone production at week 8-9. Testosterone induces the differentiation of the mesonephric duct (Figure 8) into the epididymis, appendix epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, and seminal vesicle44 as well as masculinization of the external genitalia through conversion to DHT.\n\nFollowing development, testicular descent starts at week 10 and depends on intra-abdominal pressure, hormonal influences, and tension from the gubernaculum.45 As the testis enters the deep (internal) inguinal ring and forms the inguinal canal, a layer of peritoneum forms the tunica vaginalis. The testis passes the inguinal canal between weeks 20-28 and exits through the superficial (external) inguinal ring to enter the scrotum. The external oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle, and transversalis fascia of the anterior abdominal wall provide the respective scrotal layers that cover the testis as the external spermatic fascia, cremasteric fascia and muscle, and internal spermatic fascia.45\n\nThe Female Gonad and Reproductive Tract\n\nIn females, the undifferentiated gonad develops into the ovary and the paramesonephric (Müllerian) duct develops into the fallopian tube, uterus, cervix, and proximal vagina.\n\nOvaries develop in the absence of the SRY gene in those with 46,XX genotypes or with 46,XY genotypes but loss of the SRY gene.46 The ovarian cortex proliferates and makes primary sex cords that extend to the gonadal medulla. At 4 months, the cords divide and form primordial follicles comprised of oogonia and follicular cells. Oogonia undergo mitosis and primary oocytes are arrested at prophase I at the time of birth as a reserve of follicles for future reproduction.42 Compared to testicular descent, the ovaries descend into the pelvis in a shorter amount of time.45\n\nFemale gonadal development has been previously considered to be the “default” mechanism that occurs from no SRY gene influence. However, ovarian development does not appear to be a simple passive process. It is actively promoted through the genetic and molecular influences of WNT4 and DAX-1.37,40,41,42 Both genes have anti-testis effects and WNT4 has been considered the “ovary-determining gene”.37,40 WNT4 upregulates DAX-1 expression to suppress SF1 transcriptional activity, inhibit function of SOX-9, and ultimately promote ovarian development.41,42\n\nPrior to sexual differentiation, the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts arise as epithelial invaginations lateral to the mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts.47 The absence of AMH early in embryonic development allows the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts to develop into the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and proximal vagina (Figure 8).42,44,48 The lateral aspects of these ducts form the fallopian tubes. The medial aspects of the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts fuse at the midline to form the uterus and the distal end of the combined ducts contacts the urogenital sinus to join the proximal and distal vagina (Figure 9).44,47,49 The surrounding mesenchyme gives rise to the endometrium and myometrium of the uterus.48 Homologous to the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts degenerating into the appendix testis in males, the mesonephric ducts degenerate in the female to form the epoophoron, paroophoron, and Gartner’s duct adjacent to the vagina.44\n\n\nFigure 8 Mesonephric and paramesonephric duct differentiation. In males, the mesonephric duct (blue) differentiates into the epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, and seminal vesicle. In females, the paramesonephric duct (purple) differentiates into the fallopian tube, uterus, cervix, and proximal vagina.\n\n\nFigure 9 Paramesonephric duct fusion. The medial aspect of the paramesonephric ducts fuse at the midline to form the uterus. The distal end of this combination forms the cervix and proximal vagina, which then connects caudally with the urogenital sinus.\n\nComparable to gonadal development, female reproductive tract development is also not a passive “default” mechanism as WNT4 signaling is essential for Müllerian duct development and differentiation as well as suppressing male differentiation.42,48 Homeobox genes contribute to the anterior-posterior alignment of paramesonephric (Müllerian) structures.48 Similar to Sertoli cells of the testis, ovarian granulosa cells eventually secrete AMH, but do so later in fetal development after paramesonephric (Müllerian) structures have developed.43\n\nKey Points\n\nGonadal and ductal differentiation is outlined in (Table 1) The undifferentiated gonad and primordial germ cells can develop into the testis with spermatogonia or the ovary with oogonia. The subsequent hormone secretion from these gonads influences the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct to become the epididymis, appendix epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, and seminal vesicle or the paramesonephric (Müllerian) duct to become the fallopian tube, uterus, cervix, and proximal vagina.\n\nExternal Genitalia\n\nThe external genitalia are initially bipotential for the two sexes until the seventh week of gestation. As the cloaca is undergoing separation into the urogenital sinus and anorectal canal (previously discussed in the lower urinary tract section), folds develop on both sides of the cloaca. After the urorectal septum completes cloacal division, the lateral folds become the urogenital folds and the anterior portion of the folds coalesce to form the genital tubercle. Swellings lateral to the genital tubercle form the labioscrotal swellings. The genital tubercle, urogenital folds, and labioscrotal swellings (Figure 10) differentiate under hormonal influence from the concurrently developing gonads.\n\n\nFigure 10 External genitalia differentiation. The genital tubercle (pink), urogenital folds (yellow), and labioscrotal swellings (blue) respectively differentiate either into the clitoris, labia minora, and labia majora in females or the phallus, urethral plate, and scrotum in males.\n\nExternal Male Genitalia\n\nAndrogen influence from testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) causes masculinization of the urogenital sinus and external genitalia into the penis and scrotum (Figure 10).34,44\n\nAndrogen exposure causes the genital tubercle to elongate at 8-12 weeks with subsequent linear growth starting at 14 weeks of gestation and ultrasonographic detection of the phallic structure starting at 18 weeks.34,50,51 SHH is expressed in the genital tubercle and urethral plate epithelium and may facilitate androgen influence on penile formation and other forms of genital masculinization.34,52 Penile mesenchymal condensations form the corpora cavernosa and spongiosum.53 Ventral curvature of the penis has been identified in fetuses through the 20th week of gestation with gradual resolution through the remainder of gestation.54\n\nThe urogenital folds fuse in the midline to form the urethral plate as part of development of the penile urethra. A groove within the midline of the urethral plate deepens and the epithelial edges of the plate fuse to form a tube.33,55 The epithelial seam formed from this fusion is then remodeled and replaced by mesenchymal cells.55 While the proximal penile urethra fuses caudally with the prostatic urethra from the urogenital sinus, tubularization progresses distally and ventrally. As previously discussed, the development of the glanular urethra is debated. While this aspect of the urethra was previously attributed to ectodermal invagination from the tip of the glans penis, more recent studies have proposed that the glanular urethra forms through tubularization with subsequent endodermal differentiation into squamous epithelium.18,32,33 As the phallus elongates and the urethral plate tubularizes, the labioscrotal swellings fuse in the midline at the median raphe to form the scrotum.56\n\nExternal Female Genitalia\n\nAlthough androgen absence avoids masculinization, development of the external female genitalia is not the “default” process as two X chromosomes, ovarian development, and estrogen contribute to the process. The significance of the genetic, gonadal, and hormonal influences to development can be demonstrated by hypoplastic external genitalia in Turner syndrome patients missing an X chromosome or in reports of X chromosome translocation.57,58\n\nThe urogenital sinus and external genitalia develop into the clitoris, labia majora and minora, and lower vagina under both the influence of estrogen and absence of androgens (Figure 10) The genital tubercle regresses in the absence of androgens and forms the clitoris. Urogenital sinus (initially formed after cloacal division) gives rise to the entire female urethra and the distal vagina. The distal vagina fuses cranially with the paramesonephric ducts. Central cells degrade to form the vaginal lumen and the posterior wall invaginates to form the hymen. The urogenital folds become the labia minora with minimal posterior fusion to form the posterior fourchette. The labioscrotal swellings remain unfused in the female to become the labia majora.\n\nTable 1 Sexual differentiation and development.\n\n\n  \n    \n       \n      Male\n      Female\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Gonads\n       \n       \n    \n    \n      Primordial germ cells\n      Spermatogonia\n      Oogonia\n    \n    \n      Sex cords\n      Seminiferous cords\n      Primordial follicles\n    \n    \n      Mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts\n      Epididymis, appendix epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, ejaculatory duct\n      Gartner’s duct, epoophoron, paroophoron\n    \n    \n      Paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts\n      Appendix testis, prostatic utricle\n      Fallopian tube, uterus, cervix, proximal vagina\n    \n    \n      Urogenital sinus\n      Bladder, proximal urethra, possibly the distal glanular urethra\n      Bladder, urethra, distal vagina\n    \n    \n      External genitalia\n       \n       \n    \n    \n      Genital tubercle\n      Penis\n      Clitoris\n    \n    \n      Urogenital folds\n      Urethral plate\n      Labia minora\n    \n    \n      Labioscrotal swellings\n      Scrotum\n      Labia majora\n    \n  \n\n\nKey Points\n\nDifferentiation of the external genitalia is also outlined in (Table 1) The genital tubercle becomes the phallus in males and the clitoris in females. The urogenital folds become the urethral plate in males and the labia minora in females. The labioscrotal swellings develop into the scrotum in males and the labia majora in females. As part of lower urinary tract development, the urogenital sinus forms the proximal urethra and its urogenital folds form the urethral plate for the distal urethra in males. In contrast, the urogenital sinus forms the entire urethra in females as well as the distal vagina.\n\nConclusion\n\nDevelopment of the urinary and reproductive tracts are integrated through their embryologic origins and interactions. The developing kidney progresses through the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros stages. The interaction between the mesonephros and cloaca gives rise to the ureteric bud and metanephric blastema that ultimately develop into the kidney and upper urinary tract. The cloaca concurrently divides, and the anterior urogenital sinus develops into the bladder and contributes to the male and female urethra. The gonads, mesonephric (Wolffian) and paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts, and external genitalia have the potential to develop along the spectrum of male and female sexual differentiation: genetic and hormonal influences respectively influence gonadal function and phenotypic appearance of the developing embryo. Various alterations to the genes, molecular interactions, or developing tissues involved in these processes can affect the long-term anatomy and function of their respective structures.\n\nReferences\n\n\nBertram JF, Douglas-Denton RN, Diouf B, Hughson MD, Hoy WE.

        "title": "Imaging of the Urinary Tract",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nDiagnostic imaging is a powerful tool for understanding the natural history of many conditions affecting the genitourinary (GU) tract, from both an anatomic and a functional perspective. With optimal use, diagnostic imaging improves patient outcomes while minimizing patient risk. Multiple modalities are available to image the human body in detail including ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), nuclear scintigraphy, and fluoroscopy/ radiography. Technological advances in these modalities are ongoing.\n\nIn the pediatric setting, the indications for diagnostic imaging depend not only upon the clinical presentation, but also the age (or level of development) of the patient. More than one imaging technique may be required to fully evaluate the anatomy and physiology of the GU tract. While the clinical presentation is paramount and will often allow for an algorithmic approach to imaging, the best approach in a teenager can differ from that in a baby or toddler.\n\nRadiation Considerations\n\nOver the past twenty to thirty years, clinicians and laypeople alike have become more concerned about radiation exposure from medical imaging and its potential dangers, especially in pediatric patients. Risk of future cancers may be higher in children due to several factors. First, young children are smaller than adults, leading to more kinetic energy per unit mass for the same amount of exposure. Children also have greater cell proliferation rates, increasing radiosensitivity. Finally, children have longer life expectancy from the time of the radiation exposure, allowing for radiation-induced chromosomal mutations to become clinically relevant.1\n\nIn many cases, the clinical question can be answered without the use of ionizing radiation. Care should be taken, however, to weigh the risks and benefits of a procedure. In cases of trauma, the gold standard remains a contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis.2 It should comfort the ordering clinician to know that twenty years of improvements in CT technology have allowed for doses between ten and a hundred (or more) fold lower than those at the turn of the millennium.3 On the other hand, many clinicians are not aware that a single abdominal radiograph (KUB) does not spare much radiation compared to a modern CT of the belly.4\n\nWhile MRI may seem preferable to CT from a radiation standpoint, sedation for MRI is still a necessity in most children under the age of about 8 years. The risks of sedation (especially repeated sedation) for children are still unclear. Faster scanning times, virtual reality interfaces, and robust child life programs all hold promise for minimizing sedation needs.5\n\nQuestions to be asked when choosing an investigation are:\n\n\n  Will this investigation answer the clinical question?\n  Is there a previous investigation that would answer the current clinical question?\n  Is there a safer (consider radiation or sedation need) alternative?\n  What is the developmental level of my patient?\n\n\nIf there is any doubt, discussion with your radiologist is advisable.\n\nContrast in Imaging of the Urinary Tract\n\nIodinated Contrast Agents\n\nIodinated contrast is used for CT and VCUG. When ordering a procedure involving contrast, the clinician should be aware of potential risks. The first is the risk of a severe allergic or allergic-like reaction. These adverse events are highly unlikely with modern contrast agents. An estimate for the rate of allergic type reactions is 0.6%, of which most are mild and self-limiting. For severe reactions, the estimate is 0.04%. History of prior allergic type reaction to iodinated contrast is the clearest and most important risk factor for a subsequent reaction. The risk in patients with such a history should be carefully weighed against the benefit of a subsequent CT scan. Evidence remains inconclusive as to the benefits of premedication.6\n\nThe second risk that the ordering clinician should consider is the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), defined as a sudden deterioration in renal function that is caused by the intravascular administration of iodinated contrast. Unfortunately, the true risk of this entity is unknown even in adults. As is the case with allergic type reactions, there is one risk factor that is generally accepted, in best practice, to predispose a patient to CI-AKI; this risk factor is pre-existing renal insufficiency. No clear threshold of eGFR has been established (above which risk can be ignored). However, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends an eGFR cutoff of 30 mL/min/1.73 m.26\n\nCalculation of eGFR in children requires knowledge of the patient height and serum creatinine. The approximate eGFR is then given by the bedside Schwartz equation:6\n\nGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 0.41 × height / serum creatinine\n\nThere are newer formulas that provide more accurate estimates of renal function on the basis of serum creatinine or cystatin-c, including the CKiD-U25 equations, which are age, sex, and height adjusted.7 A calculator is available here. It is important to note that dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients can receive iodinated contrast without risk of AKI, as they have non-functioning kidneys.\n\nMRI Contrast Agents\n\nFor contrast enhanced MRI, a gadolinium chelate is used. Allergic reactions to these agents are even less likely than to iodinated contrast, with an approximate rate of 0.05%. Management of allergic reactions to gadolinium is the same as for iodinated contrast agents, and this will be discussed below. A risk unique to gadolinium agents is nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a disease resembling scleroderma which can lead to joint contractures and organ failure and can occasionally be fatal.6 This entity is still poorly understood, but it is fortunately quite rare. Patients with acute kidney injury, stage 4 or stage 5 chronic kidney disease, or those on dialysis may have up to a 7% risk of developing NSF with certain gadolinium agents (types I or possibly III). The use of gadolinium in such patients may still be appropriate in rare cases where the potential benefit of a contrast-enhanced MRI is very high. However, informed consent in this circumstance is good practice. Whenever possible, a lower risk gadolinium agent (group II) should be used in this population.6\n\nUltrasound Contrast Agents\n\nUltrasound contrast agents consist of a phospholipid or protein microsphere containing an echogenic inert gas. These agents transiently improve ultrasound contrast resolution and are approved for intravenous and endoluminal use. Dedicated ultrasound software is required. Ultrasound contrast agents are very safe, with severe reactions occurring in approximately 0.01% of cases. There is no known renal toxicity at approved doses.6\n\nManagement of Allergic-Type Reactions\n\nCurrent recommendations by the American College of Radiology Manual on Contrast Media for management of allergic reactions advise prompt administration of epinephrine in the presence of the following:\n\n\n  Severe bronchospasm\n  Diffuse erythema with profound hypotension\n  Laryngeal edema\n  Hypotension with tachycardia\n\n\nCurrent dosing regimen is summarized in the table below (Tabe 1).8\n\nTable 1 Epinephrine dosage for contrast reactions.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Route\n      Dose\n      Notes\n      Repeat\n      Max dose\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      intravenous\n      0.01 mg/kg\n      slowly into running IV infusion of fluids\n      Every 5-15 minutes\n      1 mg\n    \n    \n      intramuscular\n      0.01 mg/kg\n       \n      Every 5-15 minutes\n      1 mg\n    \n    \n      Auto Injector 15–30 kg\n      0.15 mg\n      Use IV (above) if less than 15 kg\n       \n       \n    \n    \n      Auto Injector &gt; 30 kg\n      0.3 mg\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nACR Appropriateness Criteria\n\nAmerican College of Radiology (ACR) appropriateness criteria are consensus recommendations freely available online to the clinician in search of the appropriate imaging study in various situations. The recommendations are developed by panels of experts and are frequently updated.\n\nTable 2 ACR Appropriateness criteria renal ultrasound recommendations.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Indication\n      Notes\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Neonate with prenatal UTD, initial post-natal ultrasound\n      Ideally at least 72 hours old\n    \n    \n      Neonate with prenatal UTD and normal post-natal ultrasound\n      Follow-up 1–6 months at clinician’s discretion\n    \n    \n      Neonate with prenatal UTD and SFU grade 1-2 or APRPD less than 15 mm on post-natal ultrasound\n      Consider voiding study as complimentary investigation\n    \n    \n      Neonate with prenatal UTD and SFU grade 3-4 or APRPD greater than 15 mm on post-natal ultrasound\n      Voiding study and nuclear medicine collecting system scan also recommended\n    \n    \n      Atraumatic hematuria\n      When macroscopic or associated with proteinuria\n    \n    \n      Suspected urolithiasis\n       \n    \n    \n      Febrile UTI\n      In child under 2 months\n    \n    \n      Recurrent febrile UTI or poor response to antibiotics\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nImaging Modalities\n\nUltrasound\n\nIn children, ultrasound (US) is a workhorse modality. It is nearly always the first line of investigation in suspected renal abnormalities (trauma is the notable exception). US is cheap, non-ionizing, and is readily available. The disadvantage is that it is operator dependent. Especially when interpretation is remote, the radiologist relies heavily on the sonographer.\n\nFor the indications below, ultrasound is recommended as the initial imaging modality.8,9\n\nKidney Anatomy\n\nRenal sizes for age have been well established and appropriate growth can readily be demonstrated by ultrasound. There is an approximate margin of error of plus or minus 7 mm depending on imaging planes or patient motion (with CT serving as the gold standard), meaning that comparison across several prior ultrasounds will provide a more reliable indication of renal growth (or lack thereof). Kidneys may be lobular or have prominent columns of Bertin as normal variants.\n\nCorticomedullary differentiation is normally very conspicuous in neonates. As cortical glomeruli are physiologically pruned as the child matures, the cortex normally becomes more hypoechoic. Thus, the normal kidney in an older child or teenager will resemble the adult appearance, with near isoechogenicity of the cortex and medulla contrasting clearly with the bright renal sinus. A familiarity with the normal appearance of the kidney at different ages is essential for the pediatric radiologist and allows for the diagnosis of subtle abnormalities.\n\n\nFigure 1 Normal kidney in a four month old.\n\n\nFigure 2 Normal kidney in a 3 year old.\n\n\nFigure 3 Normal Kidney in an 11 year old.\n\nFollow Up of Prenatal Urinary Tract Dilation\n\nThis is the most common indication for a pediatric renal ultrasound in the outpatient setting. The architecture of the dilated collecting system is usually well-depicted by ultrasound and can provide clues to the etiology. Despite many efforts at standardization (beginning in 1988 and ongoing), descriptive terminology has been sadly inconsistent. This inconsistency has hampered efforts to correlate urologic outcomes with the degree of prenatal collecting system dilation. While ACR appropriateness criteria are based on the 1988 SFU classification system, most children’s hospitals have now adopted the UTD classification system. This classification system was developed in 2014. UTD introduced unified descriptive terminology for both pre and postnatal ultrasound to facilitate standardized perinatal evaluation.  The clinician is well advised to become familiar with the wording within their affiliated radiology practice and encourage standardization where possible.\n\n\nFigure 4 SFU grading of collecting system dilation\n\n\nFigure 5 (a) Urinary tract dilation (UTD) classification shows a transverse view of mid/interpolar kidney.

Frequency of screening and age range vary according to the specific predisposing condition.11\n\n\nFigure 10 Echogenic renal mass on screening ultrasound in a patient with WAGR syndrome.\n\n\nFigure 11 MRI confirmed multiple masses (same patient as Figure 10).\n\nRenal Blood Flow\n\nUltrasound provides valuable information in cases of suspected renal artery stenosis.\n\n\nFigure 12 Normal arterial tracing in an 11 year old with hypertension.\n\nRenal Calculi\n\nObstructing calculi may be directly visible by ultrasound or may be inferred by the presence of a dilated collecting system on the symptomatic side. Twinkling artifact can be exploited to detect stones.\n\n\nFigure 13 Calculus at the lower pole of the right kidney.\n\n\nFigure 14 Twinkling artifact improves conspicuity of calculi.\n\nBladder Abnormalities\n\nAn adequately distended bladder can be assessed for wall thickening, trabeculation, debris or stones. Bladder masses may be incidentally found. Post void images are useful in patients with suspected dysfunctional voiding.\n\n\nFigure 15 Highly vascular bladder mass in a teenager.\n\nTechnique:\n\n\n  Full bladder (in toilet trained child).\n  Bladder scanned first before remainder of abdomen to prevent early emptying of the bladder.\n  Sagittal views of the kidneys; best for length.

An extrarenal pelvis seen in the sagittal plane can mimic mild intrarenal collecting system dilation.\n\n\nScrotal Ultrasound\n\nUltrasound is the modality of choice to assess the scrotum in the setting of pain or palpable abnormality.12\n\nTechnique:\n\n\n  Images of the testes in greatest dimension in two planes and measurements\n  Images of the epididymal head (older boys) and measurements\n  Color Doppler showing both testes\n  Spectral Doppler showing arterial flow in both testes\n  Views of the spermatic cords (ideally motion clips)\n  Document hydrocele or varicocele if present\n\n\n\nFigure 16 Bilateral hydroceles in a neonate\n\n\nFigure 17 Non-communicating hydrocele in a neonate\n\n\nFigure 18 Inguinal hernia in a neonate\n\n\nFigure 19 Torsed testicle with absence of color flow\n\n\nFigure 20 Torsed testicle with absence of blood flow on power Doppler\n\n\nFigure 21 Torsed right testicle and normal blood flow to the left testicle\n\n\nFigure 22 Paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma in a teenager with painless palpable mass\n\n\nFigure 23 Color image of paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma\n\n\nFigure 24 Varicocele\n\n\nFigure 25 Epididymitis\n\nRadiography\n\nRadiographs use the difference in radiographic density of the various body parts to create an image (air, fat, fluid, bone, and metal). Modern radiographs are stored using a picture archiving and communication system (PACS), which is a digital imaging system. Advantages of PACS include improved resolution of the images and the ability to instantly and remotely share access.\n\nAbdominal radiographs are often obtained in the acute setting (acute abdominal pain) to assess the bowel gas pattern and exclude free air (two views usually required for the latter).\n\nOther potential findings:\n\n\n  Soft tissue calcifications\n  Large abdominal masses\n  Organomegaly\n  Bone abnormalities\n  Support device positioning (e.g. ureteral stents)\n\n\nA single supine abdominal radiograph is also commonly obtained by pediatric urologists in the outpatient setting for known or suspected constipation. By expert consensus, this is not indicated in children with large amounts of stool by rectal exam.13 There may be an indication for the practice in cases where a rectal exam is not possible (such as a traumatic history). The provider should remember that abdominal radiographs can result in a non-trivial radiation burden over time.\n\n\nFigure 26 Abdominal radiograph showing mass effect in the right upper quadrant\n\nVoiding Cystourethrography and Voiding Urosonography\n\nVCUG is a specialized radiology procedure that is primarily used to assess for the presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and to assess urethral morphology. The rationale has been the presumed link between reflux and post infectious scarring. Despite thirty years of study since the beginning of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for reflux, questions remain. Cystograms are less frequently performed than in the past, and watchful waiting is often preferred over antibiotic prophylaxis.14 Voiding studies have traditionally been performed using fluoroscopy. A transition is underway in the United States toward the use of contrast enhanced ultrasound (ceUS). In Europe, contrast enhanced ultrasound has been performed since the 1990s and has been widely available since the early 2000s. However, ultrasound contrast agents were not approved for use in the US until 2016. There remains debate as to the sensitivity of ceVUS for urethral anomalies in the male infant. As of this writing, ACR appropriateness criteria still recommend VCUG over ceVUS in that setting, despite the existence of review articles showing excellent depiction of urethral anatomy by ceVUS.8,15,16\n\nFluoroscopy is still frequently used, including at this author’s institution, even though it exposes the patient to ionizing radiation. Another disadvantage of traditional fluoroscopy is that it requires the patient to lie flat to void; this is often difficult for toilet trained patients.\n\nAseptic bladder catheterization is required for both types of test, and is often the most difficult part of the exam for the patient. A small feeding tube (5 Fr to 10 Fr depending on the patient size and age) is passed via the urethra into the bladder. The use of sedation in children between about two and six years is controversial. The potential risks of sedation must be weighed against the harm done by psychological stress. The use of an octagon board or similar to immobilize the patient is likewise controversial. Some pediatric radiologists prefer to use the board in older infants or young toddlers. A child life professional is a valuable asset during these studies and can be a comforting presence for both the patient and the accompanying parent.\n\nOnce the catheter is in place and the bladder is emptied, contrast material is instilled under fluoroscopic (or sonographic) observation. The sonographic exam may use a blood pressure cuff to infuse contrast at a gentle pressure. For VCUG, contrast is instilled under gravity. The standard images obtained for both VCUG and ceVUS are essentially the same.\n\nVCUG Technique:\n\n\n  Fluoroscopic spot of abdomen (baby) or level of kidneys and level of bladder (older child)\n  Spot or last image hold of bladder at initial fill (ureterocele evaluation)\n  Intermittent checks to assess for reflux\n  Near predicted bladder capacity, obtain bilateral oblique last image hold or spots\n  At first void, check for reflux\n  Second cycle (at least) in infant or febrile UTI patient\n  Lateral voiding view of urethra in male patient (ideally with catheter out)\n\n\nVoiding urosonography standard images will mostly be similar, with the exception of the initial scout view. Panoramic views can assist in extending the field of view in sonography. However, smaller field of view remains a limitation of ultrasound.\n\nCare should be taken to fill the bladder adequately and not to overfill. A useful bladder capacity formula (for children over age 12 months) is age plus 2 multiplied by 30 for the predicted bladder capacity (in mL). A newborn can be expected to hold about 50 mL. Oblique fluoroscopic spots or at least last image holds should be obtained with maximal bladder distension to assess for low grade reflux (which can be obscured in the AP projection). Tapping on the bladder, gentle massage over the belly or warm water sprinkled on the skin can be helpful to induce young children to void. Sedation can occasionally make voiding more difficult for patients. Overfilling (to more than twice the predicted capacity) is to be avoided, as it can make this problem more likely.\n\n\n  Indications\n    \n      Vesicoureteral reflux\n      Studying the urethra during voiding\n      Bladder abnormalities\n    \n  \n  Contraindications\n    \n      Acute urinary tract infection\n      Previous severe contrast reaction\n    \n  \n  Patient preparation\n    \n      Patient should void prior to investigation (young children can have the bladder drained prior to filling).\n      Antibiotic cover with Trimethoprim 2 mg/kg/dose once daily for 3 days prior to investigation (in children not on prophylactic antibiotics)\n      Editor’s note: The evidence for this is limited and the practice is not universal.\n    \n  \n  Complications\n    \n      Contrast related reactions\n      Urinary tract infection\n      Bladder over distension and rupture\n      Catheter trauma\n    \n  \n  Findings\n    \n      Grade I – reflux into non-dilated ureter\n      Grade II – reflux into the renal pelvis and calyces without dilatation\n      Grade III – mild/moderate dilatation of the ureter, renal pelvis and calyces with minimal blunting of the fornices\n      Grade IV – dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces with moderate ureteral tortuosity\n      Grade V – gross dilatation of the ureter, pelvis and calyces; ureteral tortuosity; loss of papillary impressions\n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 27 Radiological grading of vesicoureteral reflux\n\n\nFigure 28 Ureterocele on fluoroscopic last image hold\n\n\nFigure 29 Grade 3 reflux into both kidneys\n\n\nFigure 30 Grade 5 reflux on the right with ectopic insertion into urethra\n\n\nFigure 31 Dilated posterior urethra and massively dilated right ureter in the setting of posterior urethral valves\n\nRadionuclide Studies\n\nDMSA / Static Renal Scintigraphy\n\nDimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) binds to plasma proteins and is retained by the renal cortex on renal clearance, allowing functional assessment. Quantitative data on kidney function is crucial information unobtainable by ultrasound. Tc99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy has been considered the investigation of choice in the assessment of parenchymal damage due to acute or chronic pyelonephritis and provides data on differential kidney function. A bladder catheter is not required for the DMSA scan, since the radiotracer is not excreted into the urine. DMSA SPECT increases sensitivity, but sedation is required in young children in order to obtain high quality images.17 DMSA does not provide information about the collecting system or urodynamics.\n\n\n  Indications\n    \n      Assess renal function\n      Investigation of renal infection\n      Renal congenital anomalies (e.g., horseshoe kidneys)\n      Renal scarring and renal lesions\n    \n  \n  Contraindications\n    \n      None\n    \n  \n  Technique\n    \n      DMSA injected intravenously and images obtained by a Gamma camera 1–6 hours later.\n    \n  \n  Information gathered\n    \n      Relative renal function\n      Absolute uptake\n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 32 DMSA scan showing scarring and reduced function of the right lower moiety of a duplicated kidney and a non-functioning upper moiety\n\nMAG-3 Scan / Dynamic Renal Scintigraphy\n\nMercaptoacetyletriglycerine (MAG-3) is highly plasma protein bound, so it is cleared by tubular secretion. Dynamic scintigraphy with MAG3 gives insight into kidney function and morphology. Sedation is required for young children (under about 5 years). The initial part of the study demonstrates perfusion and renal cortical function, allowing for distinction between reversible and irreversible lesions. The collecting system and urodynamics are then characterized with the aid of furosemide. A reassuring MAG-3 scan allows the pediatric urologist to safely observe a hydronephrotic patient in most cases.18\n\n\n  Indications\n    \n      Obstructed vs non-obstructed system\n      Renal artery stenosis\n      Reflux disease\n      Renal trauma\n    \n  \n  Contraindications\n    \n      None\n    \n  \n  Technique\n    \n      Hydrate patient and empty bladder\n      Bladder catheter placement\n      Injection of MAG-3\n      Image at 2–3 minutes with a gamma camera for parenchymal phase\n      Image beginning at 18–20 minutes\n      Furosemide 1 mg/kg maximum 40 mg injection when dilated renal pelvis is full\n      Sequential imaging for approximately 20 additional minutes\n      Regions of interest drawn around kidneys\n      Washout curves generated and t½ (time for half radiotracer to clear) calculated\n    \n  \n  Information gathered\n    \n      Renal perfusion\n      Cortical perfusion (split renal function)\n      Parenchyma and whole kidney transit times\n        \n          T½ less than 10 minutes is normal\n          T½ between 10 and 20 minutes indeterminate\n          T½ greater than 20 minutes suggests obstruction\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Pitfalls\n    \n      Dehydration causing poor diuretic response\n      Poor underlying renal function causing poor diuretic response\n      Distended or non-compliant bladder (place catheter)\n      Early high-grade reflux (prior VCUG/ VUS)\n      Patulous collecting system delaying washout\n      Regions of interest including spleen or liver\n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 33 MAG 3 scan showing blood flow, excretory phase, and time activity curves in a patient with symmetric renal function and a left UPJ obstruction.\n\nComputed Tomography\n\nCT with IV contrast is the standard of care in children for evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. It is fast, widely available, and allows for monitoring by the radiologist in real time. Ideally, if a renal collecting system injury is identified, a second delayed view through the kidneys or bladder (depending on the level of suspected injury) can be obtained. With rare exceptions, this is the only appropriate use of multiphase CT scanning in the pediatric population. In the United States, MRI has largely replaced CT for tumor staging of the pediatric abdomen and pelvis.\n\nNon-contrast CT can occasionally be helpful in the pediatric setting for the follow-up of renal and ureteral calculi, or diagnosis when ultrasound is unrevealing.2 Ultrasound may not reveal the obstructing calculus, especially if it is in the mid ureter (where shadowing bowel gas often blocks the sound beam). However, the presence of a dilated collecting system on the symptomatic side may allow the clinician to infer that a stone is present. In children with known calculi or conditions predisposing to calculi, CT may be desired. Very low radiation doses can be employed to assess stone burden or for follow up after intervention for stones.19 Hematuria protocols (three phase CT with non-contrast, contrast, and delayed phases) are not appropriate for children due to the high radiation burden.2\n\nIn the United States, MRI has largely replaced CT for tumor staging of the pediatric abdomen and pelvis.20 However, CT angiography is occasionally requested by our pediatric surgeons for planning purposes. CTA shows organ relationships and vascular anatomy with fewer artifacts and higher resolution than MR, allowing the surgeon to plan a more precise approach in cases of Wilms, neuroblastoma, or other malignancies. Because CT angiography requires a faster injection of contrast and has a higher radiation burden, these scans should be actively monitored by a pediatric radiologist.\n\n\nFigure 34 Contrast enhanced CT showing high grade renal laceration of left kidney.\n\n\nFigure 35 Delayed view through the kidney rules out disruption of the collecting system.\n\n\nFigure 36 CT stone study for patient with cystinuria; note partially visible bilateral stents.\n\n\nFigure 37 CT angiogram with 3D reconstruction in a cancer patient with complex arterial anatomy; three renal arteries are mapped out for each moiety\n\nMRI\n\nMRI exploits the magnetic properties of the hydrogen nucleus to produce mathematical information about the soft tissues of the human body, which can then be transformed into a detailed image. It is superior to any other modality for soft tissue contrast and does not use ionizing radiation. These advantages have made it the modality of choice for most cancer staging in the abdomen and pelvis. Numerous MRI pulse sequences are commercially available. MRI is therefore tailored to the clinical question (more so than CT), requiring specific protocols.\n\nThe resolution of MRI remains lower than CT (being about one order of magnitude inferior to CT in this respect), and evaluation of lung tissue is still limited in the clinical setting. MRI is also time-consuming and noisy, necessitating some form of sedation in most children under the age of about eight years. Whereas adult patients can (usually) follow breath hold instructions, this is difficult or impossible for young children. Software allowing for free-breathing scanning is essential for MRI body imaging in children.21 These sequences typically take longer than a breath hold sequence, but can still be obtained fairly quickly (in approximately three minutes). Duration of an MRI scan may last anywhere from thirty minutes to over an hour depending on the specific protocol.\n\nAssessment of the urinary tract is called magnetic resonance urography (MRU). MRU is capable of providing both anatomic and functional information with one exam.8 MRU correlates well with Lasix renal scanning in terms of assessing renal function. Patients are hydrated with normal saline (approximately 10 mL/kg) and Lasix is administered at the start of the scan, in a dose of 1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 20 mg. In cases of suspected ureteropelvic junction obstruction, it may help to image the patient in the prone position or on the side contralateral to the suspected obstruction. In sedated patients, a Foley catheter can be placed.8 MRU for sedated patients is a cooperative enterprise necessitating good communication between the urologist, the radiology team and the sedation or anesthesia team.\n\nMR angiography spares the patient radiation but has lower resolution and is more susceptible to artifacts than CTA.\n\nIn fetal diagnosis, MRI is a complimentary modality to ultrasound. Fast pulse sequences are essential for fetal imaging. While fetal MRI is most frequently requested for further evaluation of a brain anomaly, it can provide additional information about the fetal urinary tract as well. It can be especially useful in the context of surgical planning for complex urogenital anomalies.22 In general, image quality in fetal MRI improves later in gestation.\n\n\n  MRI indications in pediatrics\n    \n      Staging of cancers\n      Suspected renal mass\n      Screening of patients at risk for tumor (e.g. TS, VHL)\n      May be appropriate for complicated pyelonephritis\n    \n  \n  MR urography\n    \n      Method\n        \n          Fluid sensitive urography using heavily weighted T2 MRI techniques\n          Excretory MR urography using T1 weighted contrast enhanced scans and furosemide\n        \n      \n      Indications\n        \n          Collecting system anatomy\n          Determine level of obstruction in renal tracts (intrinsic and extrinsic)\n          Congenital anomalies\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 38 Fluid sensitive fat-suppressed MR image showing dilated left upper pole in a duplicated kidney.\n\n\nFigure 39 Post contrast dynamic MR image shows a dilated but non-obstructed left megaureter.\n\n\nFigure 40 Fluid sensitive fat-suppressed MR image shows a hydronephrotic horseshoe kidney and a neurogenic bladder morphology.\n\n\nFigure 41 Dynamic post-contrast MR series confirms obstruction of the horseshoe kidney.\n\n\nFigure 42 Fluid sensitive fat-suppressed MR image shows a small dysplastic left kidney.\n\n\nFigure 43 Dynamic post-contrast MR series shows delayed and minimal enhancement of the dysplastic kidney indicating limited function.\n\n\nFigure 44 Dynamic post-contrast MR series shows small right kidney in a patient with prune belly and bilateral vesicoureteral reflux.\n\n\nFigure 45 Fluid sensitive fat-suppressed MR image showing replacement of the renal parenchyma with multiple masses in a patient with nephroblastomatosis.\n\n\nFigure 46 Post contrast MR images show enhancement characteristics of the masses.\n\n\nFigure 47 View of a normal kidney and adrenal gland in a fetus with ascites\n\nIntervention in Pediatric Urology\n\nInterventional procedures are integral to the management of pediatric urological conditions.23,24 The pediatric radiology subspecialty is distinct from both pediatric radiology and adult interventional radiology, and pediatric IR practitioners are remain small in number, despite growth over the last fifteen years.25\n\nDrainage of Urinary Tracts Secondary to Obstruction/Nephrostomies\n\n\n  Should be reserved for patients where retrograde drainage approach is not possible\n  Pre procedural preparation would include assessing risk of bleeding and infection\n  Antibiotic cover\n  Access to renal collection system either via ultrasound, fluoroscopy or CT guidance.\n  Complications\n    \n      Hemorrhage\n      Sepsis\n      Organ injury\n      Thoracic injury (i.e., pneumothorax)\n    \n  \n\n\nPercutaneous Nephrolithotomy\n\n\n  Reserved for patients who are not candidates for ureterscopy or shock wave lithotripsy\n  Two step procedure\n    \n      Access to collecting system by radiologist using ultrasound/fluoroscopy\n      Removal of stone by urologist\n    \n  \n\n\nOther Interventions\n\n\n  Ureteric stenting\n  Ureteric dilatation secondary to stricture\n  Biopsy of renal tumors\n  Embolization of renal tumors or renal hemorrhage\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Brown BP, Simoneaux SF, Dillman JR, Rigsby CK, Iyer RS, Alazraki AL, et al..

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe kidneys play an essential role in the normal health and development of children. The nephron is the functioning unit of the kidney, with each kidney containing ~500,000–1,000,000 nephrons. Cumulatively, the basic processes of the nephron are 1) filtration, 2) reabsorption, and 3) secretion.\n\n\nFigure 1 The nephron is the functioning unit of the kidney and is composed of the glomerulus, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct.\n\nEach nephron has 5 main parts: 1) the glomerulus, 2) the proximal tubule, 3) the loop of Henle, 4) the distal convoluted tubule, and 5) the collecting ducts (Figure 1). The glomeruli (‘filters’) have both charge and size selectivity and filter plasma across the endothelial (capillary), glomerular basement membrane, and epithelial (podocyte) layers. (See below regarding assessment of filtration.) The proximal tubule (‘workhorse’) is where approximately 85% of reabsorption occurs—including sodium, water, amino acids, and glucose. The loop of Henle allows for dilution and subsequent concentration of urine via the counter current multiplier. The distal convoluted tubule contains the macula densa which is critical for juxtaglomerular feedback with subsequent autoregulation of renal blood flow. Autoregulation allows for a fairly constant glomerular filtration rate (GFR) under normal physiological circumstances. Finally, the collecting ducts respond to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), which allows for concentration of urine, as well as aldosterone which allows for secretion of potassium.\n\nSummary of Kidney Function\n\n\n  Filtration of nitrogenous waste\n  Volume/blood pressure control\n  Electrolyte balance\n  pH regulation\n  Vitamin D conversion\n  Epogen production\n\n\nBeyond filtration, the kidneys also control volume and blood pressure (via both response to ADH as well as the renin angiotensin aldosterone system), regulate electrolyte balance, help regulate serum pH, convert inactive 25-hydroxy vitamin D to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and secrete epogen.\n\nAssessing Renal Function\n\nDespite the complexity of filtration, reabsorption and secretion along the nephron, assessment of nephron function can be simplified into two parts: filtration (glomeruli) and tubular function.\n\nAssessment of Filtration\n\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the rate at which plasma is cumulatively filtered through the nephrons. After filtration, most of the filtered load is reabsorbed along the nephron. In pediatrics, the Schwartz equation is most commonly used to estimate GFR (eGFR) in children.1 The Schwartz equation (Figure 2) is based on serum creatinine as well as the child’s height. While a normal GFR in adults is ~120 mL/min/1.73 m2, in pediatrics a normal GFR varies depending on a child’s age. Typically, a full-term neonate’s initial GFR is only ~30 mL/min/1.73 m2 while a premature neonate’s initial GFR can be even lower ~15 mL/min/1.73 m2.2 Regardless of gestational age, GFR roughly doubles within 2 weeks of age because of decreasing vascular resistance with a resultant increase in renal blood flow and perfusion. GFR then continues to increase (corrected for body surface area) and reaches adult norms at about 19 months of age. Serum creatinine is the easiest way to estimate GFR but has drawbacks, as serum creatinine is affected by muscle mass, body habitus, and underlying medical conditions.\n\n\nFigure 2 The Schwartz equation is a simple bedside formula to estimate glomerular filtration rate in children.\n\nCystatin C\n\nWhile creatinine has been the mainstay laboratory value to assess renal function, a new molecule to estimate GFR has been increasingly utilized. Cystatin C is a molecular housekeeping protein produced by all nucleated cells that is excreted at a constant rate in the urine and not reabsorbed by the nephron. Equations have now been created for both children and adults to measure the serum level of Cystatin C and use that to assess eGFR. Additionally, it has been shown that certain populations, specifically those with poor muscle mass/muscular dystrophies and children with spina bifida, have more accurate estimates of their GFR using Cystatin C alone.3,4 Cystatin C does have pitfalls, as it can be up or down regulated in certain clinical scenarios. Children with poorly managed thyroid dysfunction or those on steroids can affect their serum cystatin C and thus make it a poor marker for measuring eGFR in those populations.5 Additionally, like creatinine, most eGFR calculations using Cystatin C are only validated in children 1–2 years and greater, due to GFR not maturing until about 2 years of age.\n\nEstimating Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate\n\nIn addition to the Schwartz equation, several other equations to estimate GFR have been developed using either creatinine, cystatin C, or both in combination. One example is the Zappitelli equation, which provides a cystatin C only eGFR calculation for children 1–18 years old.6 Additionally, CKiD (Chronic Kidney Disease in Children cohort study) has published updated equations to estimate GFR in children with chronic kidney disease from ages 1–25 using either Creatinine, Cystatin C, or a combination of both.7 Consideration of the study cohort is important to ensure appropriate interpretation of the estimated GFR (Table 1). Children who have an abnormal eGFR should be referred to a pediatric nephrologist for further evaluation, work-up, and management.\n\nTable 1 A sample of various equations to estimate eGFR in children using serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, or both serum measures.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Estimated GFR (eGFR) Equation\n      Study Population\n      Calculator\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Creatinine only\n       \n       \n    \n    \n      Schwartz equation (k=0.55)8\n      Children 1–21 with CKD\n      —\n    \n    \n      Modified bedside Schwartz eq.

Consider sending serum Cystatin C, if able, at least annually on children with spina bifida after the age of 2 years to monitor their kidney function and refer to a pediatric nephrologist if the eGFR is abnormal.4\n\n\nAssessment of Tubular Function\n\nTubular function can be assessed via electrolyte balance as well as the ability to concentrate and dilute urine. Tubulopathies can often be successfully diagnosed via interpretation of electrolyte abnormalities.11 For example, tubular wasting of sodium, phosphorus, potassium, amino acids and glucose should precipitate an evaluation for Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi syndrome occurs when there is a global defect in proximal tubular function with resultant urinary losses of the filtered load that would normally be reabsorbed.12 Children with Fanconi syndrome typically present with failure to thrive.\n\nAs stated previously, urinary concentration occurs in the collecting ducts in the presence of, and renal response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). The concentration gradient that allows for concentrating the urine is set up in the loop of Henle, which first dilutes urine. Urine can be diluted to ~50 mOsm/kg and concentrated to ~1200 mOsm/kg. Full concentrating ability takes several months to develop, and a typical full-term neonate can only concentrate their urine to ~500 mOsm/kg. This concentrating defect of infancy is a result of an immature counter current multiplier as well as relative tissue insensitivity to ADH.13\n\nClinical Pearl\n\n\n  To estimate urine osmolality (Uosm), multiply the last two digits of the urine specific gravity by 30.\n  Example: Urine specific gravity of 1.020\n  Estimated Uosm = 20 × 30 = 600 mOsm/kg\n\n\nIn general, if serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, bicarbonate) are within normal limits, the urinalysis indicates that the child can concentrate or dilute their urine, and there is no tubular wasting of glucose or amino acids/protein, then tubular function can be assessed as normal.\n\nTubular Function by Age\n\nLike GFR, tubular function takes time to mature—this also coincides with the increasing GFR over the first few years of life. Typical values for urine electrolytes and serum electrolytes change over time, with some tubular function taking years to reach full maturity. The ability to concentrate the urine takes nearly a year to mature, making infants at greater risk for dehydration. Water excretion also takes time to mature, making it very important to provide hypotonic fluids to infants (i.e., breastmilk or formula) and not free water to prevent hyponatremia. Sodium reabsorption is initially poor in newborns, making the FENa higher in newborns if assessing for pre-renal acute kidney injury. Additionally, serum potassium levels are higher in newborns due to poor distal tubular secretion of potassium, which matures over the first 2 weeks of life. Serum bicarbonate levels are also lower in the newborn period due to poor reabsorption of bicarbonate in the proximal tubule and increased overall acid production in infants. Lastly, urine calcium excretion in increase in infants and slowly decreases until 10 years of age, making normal urine calcium/creatinine ratios decrease as the children get older.\n\nClinical Pearl\n\n\n  Many children with CKD due to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) may never fully be able to concentrate their urine, meaning that they still may have brisk urine output when clinically dehydrated. Be sure to assess patients with underlying kidney disease for other signs/symptoms of dehydration other than relying on urine output. Have a low threshold to provide IV or oral rehydration during acute illnesses.\n\n\nAcute Kidney Injury\n\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) refers to a sudden decrease in glomerular filtration rate. AKI is typically reversible, however there is a growing appreciation that AKI can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are several staging classifications of AKI, such as the p-RIFLE criteria and KDIGO criteria, which stratifies AKI in children.14 The KDIGO criteria has been adopted as the more common way of assessing AKI in the literature in recent years. It classifies AKI into stage 1, 2, and 3 based on rise of serum creatinine or decrease in urine output.15 Even more recently, there are propositions to adapt a modified KDIGO criteria to neonatal AKI.16\n\nTable 2 KDIGO classification of AKI in children using either serum creatinine or urine output.15\n\n\n  \n    \n      AKI Stage\n      Serum creatinine\n      Urine output\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Stage 1\n      1.5–1.9× baseline or ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 umol/L) increase\n      &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6–12 hrs\n    \n    \n      Stage 2\n      2.0–2.9× baseline\n      &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/hr ≥12 hrs\n    \n    \n      Stage 3\n      3.0× baseline or increase in sCr to ≥ 4.0 mg/dL (≥ 353.6 umol/L) or initiation of RRT\n      &lt; 0.3 mL/kg/hr for ≥24 hrs or anuria for ≥ 12 hours\n    \n  \n\n\nIn the setting of AKI, it is important to understand that a rise in creatinine typically appears only after significant renal dysfunction has begun, and often several days following the initial insult - well into the process of kidney injury. There are now different AKI biomarkers being studied and implemented into clinical practice to detect AKI earlier in the process before the creatinine rise.17 Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipoprotein (NGAL) has been the most promising marker of early AKI so far and is starting to be offered as a clinical test in some hospitals. Practice patterns involving NGAL vary, but it is often used to detect AKI prior to changes in serum creatinine or urine output, especially in the critical care setting.18\n\nEtiology of AKI\n\nA typical starting point to determine the etiology of AKI includes an assessment of prerenal, intrinsic renal, or obstructive processes. Obstruction can be ruled out via imaging, typically via renal and bladder ultrasound. Prerenal and intrinsic etiologies of kidney injury will be discussed herein.\n\nPrerenal Azotemia\n\nPrerenal azotemia refers to a decrease in GFR secondary to poor renal perfusion, often in the setting dehydration or volume loss. Patients who are prerenal will often exhibit oliguria (urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg/hr in children, &lt;500 mL/day in adults) and will demonstrate signs and symptoms of dehydration (tachycardia, dry mucus membranes, hypotension, increased skin turgor). Assessment of a urinary fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) will be very low (&lt;1%) (Table 3), indicating that the renal tubules are appropriately reabsorbing sodium. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is usually elevated in prerenal azotemia. This is a result of an increase in reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule which results in a passive reabsorption of both water and urea nitrogen. Thus, the patient’s serum BUN to creatinine ratio will be elevated in prerenal azotemia. The treatment of prerenal azotemia is intravascular volume repletion, typically via normal saline boluses. After attaining euvolemia, it is important not to continue to bolus with excessive fluids, as prerenal azotemia can lead to acute tubular necrosis (see below) if the injury is long-standing, and in such cases, the patient may not be able to make urine. In this case, excessive fluid resuscitation can lead to hypervolemia with resultant hypertension, edema, and respiratory distress.\n\nIntrinsic Renal Failure\n\nIntrinsic renal failure refers to AKI that is not secondary to prerenal or obstructive causes. It is most helpful to refer to the construct of the nephron when considering intrinsic AKI as this correlates with the various etiologies: 1) vascular causes; 2) glomerulonephritis; 3) acute tubular necrosis; and 4) acute interstitial nephritis.\n\nVascular\n\nVascular causes of AKI are quite common and include any perturbation in blood flow to the kidney—most commonly secondary to medications such as NSAIDs or cyclosporine/tacrolimus, which cause vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles, or ACE-inhibitors/ARBs such as lisinopril, which cause vasodilation of the efferent arterioles.19 For this reason, it is critical to remember that NSAIDs, including ketorolac and ibuprofen are completely contraindicated in any patient who is dehydrated, see Figure 3.20 Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) such as the hemolytic uremic syndrome can also be classified as a vascular cause of AKI. In TMA, platelet rich thrombi form in the capillary loops of the glomeruli, restricting blood flow and leading to a decrease in GFR.\n\n\nFigure 3 Mechanism of acute kidney injury in the setting of dehydration with NSAID exposure. (A) normal autoregulation in the setting of dehydration where decreased effective circulating volume leads to vasodilation of the afferent arterioles via prostaglandins, while the efferent arterioles are constricted by angiotensin II (via the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system). (B) Impairment of autoregulation by NSAIDs.\n\nGlomerulonephritis\n\nGlomerulonephritis (GN) can typically be diagnosed quite readily with evaluation of the urine sediment showing red blood cell casts. The hallmarks of acute glomerulonephritis include hypertension, edema and AKI. The differential diagnosis of glomerulonephritis can be divided into two main categories based on serum complement levels—hypocomplementemic or normocomplementemic. Hypocomplementic GNs include post-infectious GN, systemic lupus erythematosis, and membranoproliferative GN. Normocomplementemic GNs include IgA nephropathy, Alport’s syndrome, and the ANCA vasculitides. Treatment of acute GN depends on the underlying cause, other than in the self-resolving illness of post-infectious GN, most GNs require treatment with immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nAcute Tubular Necrosis\n\nAcute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common cause of AKI. ATN is usually caused either by ischemia-reperfusion injury, or exposure to nephrotoxic medications. Patients with ATN are typically oliguric and their urine sediment may demonstrate muddy brown or granular casts. In contrast to prerenal azotemia, patients with ATN have a FENa &gt;1% (Table 3).\n\nTable 3 Comparison of prerenal azotemia to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).\n\n\n  \n    \n       \n      Prerenal Azotemia\n      ATN\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Urine volume\n      ↑\n      usually ↓\n    \n    \n      BUN/creatinine\n      &gt;20/1\n      ~10/1\n    \n    \n      Urine [Na*)\n      &lt;20 mEg/L\n      &gt;40 mEg/L\n    \n    \n      FENa\n      &lt;1%\n      &gt;2%\n    \n    \n      Urine osm\n      &gt;500 mOsm/kg\n      ~300 mOsm/kg\n    \n    \n      Urine sediment\n      hyaline or granular casts\n      brown casts, renal tubular cell casts\n    \n    \n      Course\n      reversible with correction of underlying cause\n      oliguria x days, gradual recovery over days to wks\n    \n  \n\n\nTreatment of ATN includes renal rest—maintaining euvolemia and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Some studies have shown the use of theophylline helps reduce AKI/ATN in neonates caused by perinatal asphyxia, but decision to administer this drug should be done in collaboration with a pediatric nephrologist.21 In oliguric patients, strict attention to fluid balance is necessary to maintain euvolemia. Recovery from ATN may take days to weeks, and often the oliguria transitions to polyuria with a persistently elevated serum creatinine. When the patient becomes polyuric, it is critical to maintain adequate hydration. Until the renal tubules recover, the patient is unlikely to be able to concentrate their urine, and as such they are at risk for developing prerenal azotemia with a potential secondary renal hit if intake is not increased to keep up with output.\n\nClinical Pearl\n\n\n  A good rule of thumb when dealing with such patients is to obtain daily weights, strict ins and outs and to maintain the euvolemic patient on 1/3 × their maintenance fluid plus 1:1 replacement of urine output. The 1/3 × maintenance approximates the patient’s insensible fluid losses, while the replacement of urine output will work to maintain euvolemia in both oliguric and polyuric patients.\n  In patients who are NPO, typical fluids can be 5% dextrose 0.9% normal saline if they are otherwise normal children without underlying kidney dysfunction.22 However, serum electrolytes should be followed closely while on IV fluids. Polyuric patients may need addition of potassium to their intravenous fluids. Patients who have loose stools may need additional repletion for stool losses, including the addition of bicarbonate to the fluids. Children with kidney dysfunction should be considered case by case but starting fluids containing 5% dextrose 0.45% normal saline to reduce their salt load should be considered.\n\n\nAcute Interstitial Nephritis\n\nAcute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an underappreciated cause of AKI. AIN is often triggered by a reaction to an offending medication and is sometimes referred to as allergic interstitial nephritis. AIN may also be triggered by a viral infection; however most causes of AIN are idiopathic. While historically, urine was often sent for evaluation of eosinophils, eosinophiluria is neither sensitive nor specific for diagnosing AIN. As such, AIN can be diagnosed clinically in the setting of a patient with non-oliguric AKI with a bland urine sediment. Treatment of AIN includes cessation of the offending medication when clinically possible. AIN can also be treated with steroids, however, if the cause is medication-related, kidney injury may return once the steroids are discontinued. A rare but associated disease is tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome.23 These patients have both AIN and uveitis. TINU is often responsive to steroids, however, the uveitis requires ophthalmologic evaluation and treatment separate and in addition to renal evaluation and treatment.24\n\nClinical Pearl\n\n\n  Patients with an intra-abdominal urinary leak can inappropriately be diagnosed with AKI. In these patients, their serum creatinine rises secondary to reabsorption of urine creatinine across the peritoneal membrane with a resultant rise in serum creatinine. In this case, serum creatinine no longer reflects renal filtration. The diagnosis should be suspected in any patient with new development of ascites in the setting of a rising creatinine, who is at risk for urinary leak (i.e. recent surgical procedure).\n\n\nIndications for Dialysis\nThere is no current treatment for AKI other than supportive care. Renal replacement therapy may be required if optimal medical management does not suffice. Indications for initiating acute dialysis include volume overload, electrolyte derangements, metabolic acidosis or uremia.\n\nChronic Kidney Disease\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) refers to either laboratory or radiographic evidence of kidney disease that progresses beyond 3 months. There are five stages of CKD, based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (Figure 4). In children with CKD, specific equations (noted above) are used to estimate their eGFR in order to stage the degree of CKD. Unlike adult patients who are often followed by their primary care provider throughout the early stages of CKD, all children with CKD should be followed by a pediatric nephrologist for subspecialty care.25 Particular attention is paid to the growth and development of children with CKD. The frequency of nephrology follow-up correlates with the stage of CKD. Of note, GFR reaches its max at around 2 years of age, making it impossible to stage CKD in children less than 2 years of age accurately.\n\n\nFigure 4 Stages of Chronic Kidney Disease.\n\nManagement of Chronic Kidney Disease\n\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for CKD. However, early referral to a pediatric nephrologist can help with management of co-morbidities and delay progression of disease. Routine CKD management includes assessment of staging, blood pressure control, as well as monitoring for anemia, growth delay, and metabolic bone disease.\n\nBlood Pressure Control\n\nTight blood control to the 50th% for age, sex and percentile height has been shown to delay progression of CKD.26 ACE-inhibitors and ARBs are often the preferred agent to control blood pressure as they also protect against glomerular hyperfiltration. Blood pressure should be measured at all clinic visits, preferable manually, in patients with or at risk for CKD. Referral to a pediatric nephrologist for further evaluation and possibly a 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor study should be made for any abnormal clinic blood pressure in a child with CKD.\n\nAnemia of Chronic Kidney Disease\n\nChildren with CKD have several reasons to be anemic—including erythropoietin deficiency and increased hepcidin levels which leads to poor utilization of iron stores.27 Patients with CKD should have routine CBCs to monitor for the development of anemia. If and when they become anemic, iron stores should be checked and normalized. Patients who remain anemic despite adequate iron stores should be started on erythropoiesis stimulating agents such as epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa.25\n\nMetabolic Bone Disease\n\nFormerly referred to as secondary hyperparathyroidism, metabolic bone disease encompasses not only secondary hyperparathyroidism, but also bone mineralization and vascular calcifications. MBD is often the most challenging aspect in managing children with CKD and is unfortunately the reason for a significant amount of morbidity and mortality in our pediatric patients with CKD. MBD leads to increased cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in patients with CKD. Indeed, a pediatric patient with end stage renal disease has the cardiovascular risks of a patient in their 70s.28 Management includes maintaining adequate stores of 25-hydroxy vitamin D, maintaining normocalcemia and normal serum phosphorus levels, and supplementation of active 1-25-dihydroxyvitamin D.29,30 It is often quite difficult for patients to comply with the prescribed phosphorus binders which are taken with meals, and often cause gagging and discomfort. This is particularly difficult in young children, with whom mealtime can already be quite challenging.\n\nGrowth\n\nChildren with CKD often have difficulty with growth and development. A multidisciplinary team including a renal dietician is critical for proper monitoring of nutritional intake and growth. Unlike adults with CKD, children do not have a reduced protein limit, as they require protein for growth. We therefore recommend children with CKD obtain the recommended daily allowance of protein. Linear growth is particularly challenging because of a relative tissue insensitivity to growth hormone. Infants and toddlers with CKD often require gastrostomy tubes for either medication administration and/or supplemental formula feeds. Special renal formulas that support growth and nutrition while limiting potassium and phosphorus are often required. Supplemental growth hormone is indicated in patients not growing well linearly despite adequate caloric intake. Unfortunately, many families decline growth hormone treatment in order to save their child a daily injection, however quality of life studies have demonstrated that adult height positively correlates with quality of life.31\n\nRenal Replacement Therapy\n\nChildren who are progressing to stage V CKD require evaluation for renal replacement therapy. RRT can be in the form of either peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemodialysis (HD), or kidney transplantation. For patients who have a potential living donor, preemptive transplantation may be a suitable and often desirable option. Evaluation of a living donor make take several months, so such a preemptive transplantation should begin while the patient is still in stage IV CKD, if possible. Similarly, introducing the concepts of dialysis and transplantation at an earlier stage, such as stage III often benefits the family and patient so they can begin to think about dialysis modalities versus preemptive transplantation.\n\nThe term ‘dialysis’ refers to two separate mechanisms: 1) diffusion of solutes across a semipermeable membrane, and 2) removal of fluid via ultrafiltration.\n\nPeritoneal Dialysis\n\nIn peritoneal dialysis, dialysate is placed in the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal membrane acts as the semipermeable membrane and allows solutes to flow across and down their concentration gradient. Ultrafiltration is controlled via the addition of dextrose to the dialysate fluid. By increasing the dextrose concentration to the dialysate, the osmotic gradient increases, thereby pulling more fluid from the patient into the peritoneal cavity. The fluid is then drained from the peritoneum. Most pediatric patients undergo home PD at night while they are asleep. In this way, they undergo several cycles, typically anywhere from 6–12 cycles. The PD prescription therefore includes the fill volume, dwell time, and dialysate to be used (including the dextrose concentration). The additional volume that is drained during each cycle drain is tallied and the total accumulated over the treatment is referred to as the ultrafiltrate (UF) volume. Of note, patients may retain fluid during PD and this typically indicates they might have been hypovolemic at the initiation of the treatment. Home PD requires extensive training of the caregivers with frequent communication with their nephrology center. Caregivers are expected to keep daily logs of pre- and post- treatment weights, blood pressures, dialysate used and UF obtained. Many patients have a sliding scale prescription such that the dextrose concentration can be adjusted based on their pre-dialysis weight and blood pressure.32\n\nPeritonitis is the main risk in patients who undergo PD. Caregivers are taught to recognize the signs and symptoms of peritonitis and are also trained to obtain a peritoneal effluent for cell count and culture prior to initiating intraperitoneal antibiotics. PD patients on antibiotics should always receive anti-fungal prophylaxis to prevent fungal peritonitis. Fungal peritonitis is both difficult to diagnosis as well as treat, and unfortunately requires removal of the PD catheter and has a high risk of scarring the peritoneal membrane.\n\nMembrane failure can result from fungal peritonitis, recurrent bacterial peritonitis, or may be a result of glycosylation of the membrane from prolonged exposure to the dextrose in the dialysate. Routine peritoneal membrane tests are performed by their nephrologist to assess membrane characteristics and to help adjust PD orders over time.\n\nHemodialysis\n\nIn hemodialysis, the patient’s blood is circulated thru a dialysis machine containing an HD filter. Most filters are now hollow-fiber capillary membranes. Each fiber is hollow and allows blood to flow thru the tube, in countercurrent to dialysate flowing around the fibers. This design allows for a large surface area where-in the fibers are the semi-permeable membrane that allow for flow of solutes across the membrane and down their concentration gradient. UF is attained via negative pressure applied by the dialysis machine. The UF rate is limited by patient size, blood pressure and symptoms. Dialysis access can be challenging in pediatric patients. Often, fistula access is limited by patient size and vasculature. As a result, many pediatric patients have the additional risk of central line access, known to have an increased risk of infection above fistulas and grafts.25\n\nThe choice of dialysis modality is made based on a combination of the child’s current medical status, underlying disease, family support and often, geographic location (i.e. distance from a hemodialysis center that will treat children). Past episodes of peritonitis or surgical procedures that have left adhesions may limit the option to pursue peritoneal dialysis. Certainly, peritoneal dialysis requires more social stability as well as time, energy and commitment from the child’s caregivers. Despite these additional responsibilities, PD is often a preferred choice as it allows the child to continue to go to school. Alternatively, hemodialysis (HD) is a good alternative for patients who have either failed PD, or who’s family may be unable to provide PD at home. Home hemodialysis is also an option offered by some pediatric dialysis program for families who would be equipped for PD at home, but the patient is not a suitable PD candidate.\n\nRegardless of the dialysis modality chosen, the goal of every pediatric nephrology program is to successfully transplant their pediatric patients with ESRD. The life expectancy of children with ESRD on dialysis is 50 years shorter than healthy age-matched cohorts, compared to 15 years shorter following transplantation.28 Transplantation evaluation includes psychosocial evaluation and at times, transplantation is delayed or put on hold if the child is not interested or is deemed to be a poor candidate based on non-compliance with prescribed therapies.\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Atkinson MA, Ng DK, Warady BA, Furth SL, Flynn JT.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe urodynamic assessment of the lower urinary tract (LUT) function comprises the use of appropriate methods of evaluation during the bladder filling and voiding phases. The correct instrumentation of the studies provides the pathophysiological understanding of urologic entities that may affect children and adolescents with the aim of optimizing their therapeutic management.\n\nPediatric urodynamics requires trained staff that must implement an appropriate methodology in a setting adapted to the pediatric universe in order to deal with situations of stress correctly and obtain as much clinical urologic information as possible.\n\nThe urodynamic study of LUT can be performed in an invasive or a non-invasive fashion. In general, the current trend consists in managing LUT entities with non-invasive urodynamic evaluation and using invasive methods only in the case of neuro-urological dysfunction or complex urologic malformations.\n\nNon-Invasive Urodynamic Evaluation\n\nLUT conditions in children encompass a group of entities with overlapping urinary symptoms. These conditions are the result of disorders in the filling phase, the voiding phase, or a combination of both with different degrees of compromise. LUT symptoms can be observed in up to 20% of school children.1\n\nThe correct evaluation is determined by the pediatrician, and other specialists continue with this assessment. This approach is started when the child is around 4 years of age, and it will be more substantial if the following data can be obtained:\n\n\n  Voiding diary (2-3 days).2\n  Bristol scale / Rome IV criteria / Functional gastrointestinal disorders.3,4\n  Questionnaires (optional): urine and bowel evacuation habits, fluid intake, quality of life.5\n  Physical examination of the genital, lumbo-sacral area, gluteal region, perineum, lower limbs, reflexes.\n  Urinalysis / Urine culture: proteinuria / glycosuria.\n  Uroflowmetry / Post-void residual (PVR) urine measurement.\n  Pelvic floor electromyography (EMG) with surface (patch) electrodes\n  Ultrasonography of the upper urinary tract, bladder characteristics, constipation signs.\n  Urodynamic / video urodynamic studies (not required unless patients are refractory to initial treatment).\n  Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to detect vesicoureteral reflux\n\n\nThere exist a variety of questionnaires for the evaluation and measurement of bladder and bowel dysfunction, quality of life and behavioral comorbidities that include indications and possible difficulties. The most useful tool will be chosen by the physician considering the clinical assessment, the time available and the patient population under study.5\n\nFunctional gastrointestinal disorders in children occur in different ways and may be present in children at the age of 3 or 4 years old and be later associated to bladder dysfunction and urinary infections.6,7\n\nUroflowmetry\n\nUroflowmetry (with post-void residual measurement) can be combined with pelvic floor electromyography (EMG) to confirm dysfunctional voiding with lack of coordination between detrusor and urinary sphincter. Urodynamic studies are reserved for patients who are refractory to initial treatment.8,9\n\nUroflowmetry is a non-invasive procedure used to measure urine flow and it is defined as the volume of urine that passes through the urethra in a unit of time expressed in mL/sec. The variables assessed are maximum flow rate (Qmax), average flow rate (Qavg), total voided volume and total voiding time. This method also shows morphology of the curve obtained during voiding. A normal flow shows as a bell-shaped curve (Figure 1). It is one of the initial studies used to evaluate bladder voiding, since it provides information on detrusor contractility and bladder outlet. With this technique it is possible to avoid invasive tests and to monitor therapeutic responses.\n\n\nFigure 1 Normal flow showing bell-shaped curve\n\nUroflow measurement of PVR with ultrasound scan evaluates bladder voiding capacity. With this method several curve patterns that indicate different conditions can be identified. A tower curve pattern is indicative of an overactive bladder; a staccato curve pattern shows dysfunctional voiding, and an interruptive flow pattern can be suggestive of an underactive bladder. A plateau curve pattern is generally observed in patients with anatomical bladder obstruction (Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4).10\n\n\nFigure 2 Tower curve pattern\n\n\nFigure 3 Staccato curve pattern\n\n\nFigure 4 Plateau shaped curve pattern\n\nThere is a considerable variety of inter-observer results, especially in the case of abnormal uroflow tests, and this is one of the main limitations of this tool. Franco et al developed the concept of flow index (FI). FI was created as a measure of the actual flow rate in relation to the expected flow rate: AQavg/EQavg or AQmax/EQmax) to obtain a quantitative evaluation of bladder evacuation. Thus, the FI can help predict the estimated flow rate in a reliable way given a specific urine volume within reasonable parameters; it helps compare actual flow rates with ideal ones and, therefore, it provides more objectivity to the analysis of curves.11 A higher FI is indicative of efficient voiding and a tower curve pattern, whereas a lower FI shows dysfunctional voiding and a plateau curve pattern.\n\nUroflowmetry and Pelvic Floor Emg\n\nEven though staccato uroflow is the most common pattern observed in children with a diagnosis of voiding dysfunction as evidenced on positive uroflow/EMG during voiding, almost one third of the pediatric population show interruptive or mixed uroflow pattern in voiding dysfunction. Therefore, it is important to incorporate surface EMG electrodes in the uroflow study, especially when there is a suspicion of voiding dysfunction due to detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia.12 Uroflowmetry plus pelvic floor EMG is not only useful to diagnose specific LUT conditions, but also to objectively monitor the efficacy of treatment.13 This is shown in Figure 5.\n\n\nFigure 5 Flowmetry and Perineal Electromyography (EMG)\n\nPelvic floor EMG lag time is defined as the interval between the start of pelvic floor relaxation and the start of the urine flow curve. This non-invasive measurement in seconds is not useful to screen for conditions such as primary bladder neck dysfunction, among others.13,14 See Figure 6 for a graphic explanation of lag time.\n\n\nFigure 6 Electromyography (EMG) lag time.\n\nNevertheless, even when considering the limitations of the use of EMG with surface electrodes, it is possible to correlate FI and EMG lag time to define the specific diagnosis of LUT conditions. A lag time close to 0 seconds is associated with a greater FI, which represents overactivity that is commonly observed in the tower flow pattern. However, children that present with a lag time over 6 seconds or even negative lag time values lower than 4 seconds showed a lower FI, which implies a hypo-efficient micturition and a plateau flow pattern.15\n\nPost-Void Residual on Ultrasound Scan\n\nPost-void residual measurements in neurologically intact children are highly variable. In children 4–6 years old a single PVR &gt; 30 ml or &gt; 21% of bladder capacity (BC), where BC is determined as voided volume (VV) + PVR and expressed as percent of the expected bladder capacity (EBC = [age (yrs)+1] × 30 mL), it is recommended that a repeated PVR be performed with dual measurements, and a repeated PVR &gt; 20 mL or &gt; 10% BC is considered significantly elevated. In children 7–12 years old, a single PVR &gt; 20 ml or 15% BC, or repeated PVR &gt; 10 ml or 6% BC is considered elevated. Standard conditions should be applied to measuring PVR: the bladder should not be underdistended (&lt; 50%) nor overdistended (&gt; 115%) in relation to the EBC, and PVR must be obtained immediately after voiding (&lt; 5 min).16\n\nWhen there is a LUT condition, an ultrasound of the upper urinary tract is indicated to rule out other anomalies, such as hydronephrosis and duplex collecting systems. The presence of alterations in the bladder wall, like thickness, trabeculation or diverticula can be markers of chronic LUT dysfunction.\n\nInvasive Urodynamic Evaluation—Cystometry\n\nUrodynamic studies are not usually used to evaluate LUT symptoms in children who are neurologically intact, and they rarely provide more information that could justify its use. These studies are used when there are pathological findings on non-invasive studies, if treatments are not effective and when symptoms such as incontinence or urinary infections become aggravated.17\n\nNevertheless, invasive urodynamics is routinely used in initial evaluation, in the follow-up of children with neurogenic bladder due to spina bifida, when there is a suspicion of neurogenic detrusor-sphincter dysfunction (occult spinal dysraphism), obstruction (in posterior urethral valves), genitourinary anomalies (exstrophy, epispadias), non-neurogenic bladder dysfunction or significant post-void residual of unknown etiology.9\n\nDuring cystometry, the intravesical pressure/volume relationship is measured to document the function of storage and voiding. In the first stage of the study, these data are obtained: detrusor stability, leak point pressures, bladder sensation and bladder capacity. In the voiding phase, other parameters are measured: voiding pressure; pressure of bladder neck opening and urinary sphincter; efficiency of detrusor contraction and sustainability; uroflow pattern, and EMG synergy. Through a rectal balloon catheter, the changes in abdominal pressure and their influence in bladder pressure are evaluated.\n\nThe standardization and nomenclature defined by the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) Guidelines were used.9 Intravesical pressure is measured with a 6-French double-lumen catheter placed through the urethra. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured using an 8-French catheter and vinyl balloon catheter placed in the rectum. The bladder was filled with 0.9% saline at 37.5° Celsius at a rate of 5–10% of the child’s theoretical or expected bladder capacity per minute to a maximum rate of 10 mL/min.\n\nThe following urodynamic variables are evaluated: maximum cystometric capacity (MCC in mL); end filling detrusor pressure (Pdet in cm of water) and detrusor leak point pressure (DLPP in cm of water). We calculated the expected bladder capacity (EBC) following the formula: 30 × (age in years + 1) mL. Reduced bladder capacity was defined as &lt; 65% EBC.7 We define maximum cystometric capacity when we stop filling for the following reasons: detrusor contraction with significant volume of leaks; leaks that exceed the filling rate (&gt; 10 ml / sec); risk pressures (&gt; 40 cm of water) high-grade vesicoureteral reflux in video urodynamic studies, and urinary tract dilation. Detrusor overactivity was defined with the presence of two more detrusor contractions greater than 15 cm of water.18 Inefficient bladder voiding is defined by detrusor underactivity or neurogenic acontractile detrusor.7\n\nStage Previous to Urodynamic Studies\n\nIt is important to explain in detail the procedures to parents and patients and to show them the urodynamics suit and material to use. The facility should be adapted to pediatric patients and there should be trained staff able to manage awake children. The ideal setting would include available entertainment, such as games, tablets, TV set and video games according to age. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the importance of reaching an empty rectum, especially in the case of constipated children.\n\nIt is recommended to start the procedure with a negative urine culture collected no later than 15 days before. In children who are going to initiate clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), the urine culture may not be required, since if there is asymptomatic bacteriuria, it is not considered an extra risk factor and in general, it does not require antibiotic prophylaxis. The global incidence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) occurring post-urodynamic studies is low (0.7%). Patients without urine culture prior to undergoing urodynamics do not have a significant increase in UTIs.19\n\nIf the patient controls sphincters, is not under CIC program and has a full bladder, free uroflowmetry is performed with prior instrumentation. These data would complement the final report about that patient.\n\nSedation with midazolam administered via one of the three routes, oral, nasal or rectal, is a safe and efficient method and a convenient option during cystometry, especially in the group of young patients that may feel scared and stressed when faced with the procedure to be performed. Most patients are satisfied with the application of sedation as reported by Özmert. In that report, the group receiving a faster initiation of sedation and the lowest doses applied in a nasal fashion had more favorable outcomes despite having nasal stinging, in comparison with the group that received oral sedation. Another advantage of sedation was that cystometry was performed in a shorter time in sedated patients compared with the control group, and cystometry was not altered by midazolam.20 Chloral hydrate as a sedative is largely used in children in diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The oral solution is an effective and appropriate alternative for sedation in children.21\n\nUrodynamic Instrumentation\n\nIn general, a transurethral double-lumen 6-French catheter is inserted after applying xylocaine as an anesthetic. In some cases, as with non-collaborative children, those with comprehension difficulties or preserved urethral sensitivity, or those with a suspicion of obstructive urethra (posterior urethral valves), the collocation of a suprapubic double-lumen catheter 24 hours before the test makes it possible to better perform the study.22 It is also possible to place a double-lumen catheter in a vesicostomy or ureterostomy and then close the stoma with a silicone Foley balloon catheter.\n\nTransurethral and rectal catheters must be secured with adhesive tape to the skin opening, and by means of connecting tubes they are attached to the external pressure transducers and leveled to the height of the pubic symphysis. Before the patient is placed in a seated position and after cleaning the skin of the perineum, two surface EMG electrodes are connected symmetrically, left and right from the perianal area, in order to record the activity of the pelvic floor muscles. In addition, a third reference electrode is placed over a bony prominence. The filling cystometry is generally performed in a sitting position; however, a supine position or the child being held in mother’s arms is also acceptable.23 See Figure 7 for an example position.\n\n\nFigure 7 Position of patient\n\nIn neurologically able children and old enough to respond, the filling sensation must be determined following the standard sequence set by the ICS (International Continence Society): “first sensation of filling”, “first desire to void” and “strong desire to void”. After the micturition cycle is finished and depending on the quality of the curve, we should wonder if it is necessary to repeat the test. Once the catheters and the EMG electrodes are removed, the patients are instructed to increase the fluid intake to diminish the risk of urinary tract infection,23 and in case there is discomfort, to use of analgesic medication.\n\nInterpretation of Urodynamic Results\n\nIt is essential to know that a large part of the study time is consumed in the filling phase and a smaller proportion of the time in the emptying phase. Bladder cycle in Figure 8.\n\n\nFigure 8 Bladder cycle.\n\nFilling Phase\n\nBladder sensation may be a relevant parameter only in the case of children who are able to void willingly. As of age 4 the following data can be documented: “first desire to void” and “strong desire to void”. The child usually expresses a normal desire to urinate when they curl their toes. In addition, bladder sensation can be classified as normal, increased (hypersensitive), reduced (hyposensitive) or absent.\n\nThe parameters measured during the storage phase include: intravesical pressure (Pves), abdominal pressure (Pabd) and detrusor pressure (Pdet) where Pdet = Pves - Pabd (Figure 8).\n\nThe filling detrusor pressure (Pdet fill) is the detrusor pressure during the filling phase, and the detrusor pressure reached at the end of filling is called maximum detrusor pressure (Pdet fill max). The elasticity of the bladder wall, or wall compliance, normally increases progressively during the filling phase and can be calculated based on the initial and final points of filling rate (considering resting pressure in case of overactivity). Thus, bladder compliance is defined as the relationship between the change in bladder volume and the change in detrusor pressure (C= ΔV/ΔP; normal value: &gt; 10 mL/cm H2O).24 The filled volume does not take into account the amount of actual diuresis produced during the test. To integrate this volume, the maximum cystometric capacity (MCC) is calculated with the voiding volume and post void residual volume. Compliance variability depends on several factors such as: section of the curve used for the calculation; bladder shape, thickness and mechanical/viscoelastic properties of the bladder wall; detrusor capacity of relaxation, contractility and degree of bladder outlet resistance.25\n\nFurthermore, the shape of the filling curve should be considered since it provides information about bladder laxity. Normally, detrusor pressure remains relatively stable during bladder filling, which results in a linear curve. In pathological conditions, the filling curve is “nonlinear”, with an increase in detrusor pressure, and these changes should be documented.7 Generally, there is little or no change in pressure during the filling phase, when compliance is ensured, but there are no cut-off values to define pathological compliance. In children without neuropathic lesions, compliance should not exceed in 0.05 Y mL/cm H2O the baseline bladder pressure (Y= cystometric capacity [mL] by age). There is no report in the literature on the relationship between expected bladder capacity (EBC) and cystometric bladder capacity. Nevertheless, some authors suggest that Pdet should not exceed 30 cm H2O at EBC.26 In our center we consider pathological pressures from 20 cm of water to expected bladder capacity (Figure 9).\n\n\nFigure 9 Compliance reduced pattern\n\nDue to this limitation, we can extrapolate and use detrusor pressure reached at expected bladder capacity and Pdet fill max. Tarcan et al studied bladder pressures in children with myelomeningocele at 3 years of age and concluded that a DLPP cut-off value of 20 cm H2O showed a higher sensitivity in the prediction of upper urinary tract damage, whereas a DLPP between 20 and 40 cm H2O was not reliable in terms of prediction of damage. Thus, in Tarcan’s study 57.1% of children with DLPP between 20 and 40 cm H2O, and 62.2% of children with DLPP greater than 40 cm H2O had normal upper urinary tract. Therefore, DLPP cut-off value used as a single parameter to predict urinary tract damage in children with myelomeningocele is neither reliable nor accurate. Other risk factors are likely to coexist, such as low bladder capacity, low bladder wall compliance, high filling pressure, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, and bladder catheterization adherence, among others.27\n\nAny phasic increase in detrusor pressure during filling cystometry is defined as detrusor overactivity. This overactivity involves the presence of two or more detrusor contractions greater than 15 cm H2O18 and may occur spontaneously or be caused by cough or Credé. This detrusor increment or hyperactivity can be neurogenic or idiopathic as in Figure 10.28,29\n\n\nFigure 10 Overactive pattern\n\nIt is also likely that the child may not suppress these contractions completely and thus an increase in the pelvic floor EMG activity might be observed, as a protective reflex. Some trigger factors such as coughing, laughing, walking or jumping can generate overactivity of the detrusor. However, the presence of these contractions does not necessarily imply a neurological disorder. In the case of babies without any disease, 10% of them experience detrusor contractions. When there is detrusor contraction with little effort or without end filling (when filling reaches 150% of EBC), the detrusor muscle becomes underactive.9\n\nDetrusor leak point pressure (DLPP) indicates the lowest detrusor pressure at which urine leakage occurs in the absence of an increase in abdominal pressure or of a detrusor contraction. Abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP) refers to the lowest value of intravesical pressure that is intentionally increased (for example, due to cough) which causes urinary leakage in the absence of a detrusor contraction. High DLPP (&gt; 40 cm H2O) is often induced by the decrease in bladder wall laxity. Low DLPP indicates sphincter incompetence.7 Stress incontinence is present in adolescents who are physically active, when ALPP is greater than urethral pressure.30\n\nDespite the stimuli, it is probably necessary to remove the catheter so that the child can urinate. If voiding volume is low, we are faced with detrusor underactivity due to chronic bladder outlet obstruction or a neuropathic lesion that progresses into voiding deterioration.7\n\nVoiding Phase\n\nNormal voiding is performed with the voluntary initiation of a detrusor contraction; it is sustained and cannot be suppressed easily once it has started. During micturition, the detrusor can be classified as normal, underactive or acontractile, i.e., it does not show any activity during voiding. If the lack of contractility has a neurologic cause it is called detrusor areflexia. It shows the complete absence of a contraction coordinated by nervous control mechanisms. When the detrusor contraction is inadequate in magnitude and duration to effectively void the bladder, we are in the presence of detrusor underactivity during voiding.9\n\nSome authors have reported pressures far higher than normal in neurologically healthy children of 1 month of age, with a mean detrusor pressure during voiding of 127 cm H2O in boys and 72 cm H2O in girls.31 Figure 11 shows an example study with bladder outlet obstruction. This is probably due to a considerable sphincter activity and catheter-related effect. In the case of children afraid of urinating there may be high voiding pressures, interrupted uroflow or considerable PVR.9\n\n\nFigure 11 Infravesical obstruction\n\nWhen there is anatomical urethral obstruction (posterior urethral valves, urethral stenosis, ectopic ureterocele), there is a plateau uroflow curve, with low and constant Qmax, despite the high detrusor pressure and complete relaxation of the external urethral sphincter. See Uroflowmetry section.\n\nFunctional obstruction is due to the external urethral sphincter contraction (constant or intermittent) during voiding that creates a narrow urethral segment. It is possible to document the pelvic floor activity with simultaneous pressure/flow records and pelvic floor EMG, using surface electrodes.12,15\n\nVideo Urodynamics\n\nVideo urodynamic studies combine the benefits of both fluoroscopic cystourethrography and conventional urodynamics in a single instrumentation, which makes it possible to carry out the simultaneous anatomical and functional assessment of the urinary tract. Figure 12 demonstrates video urodynamics.\n\n\nFigure 12 Video urodynamics\n\nAdjuvant radiology has become a useful tool in differential diagnosis. Furthermore, it facilitates the analysis of images with digital technology.32\n\nIndications to Perform Video Urodynamic Studies\n\nVideo urodynamic studies are indicated when there is unclear diagnosis after simpler tests are performed or in the case of patients with complicated conditions such as:\n\n\n  Recurrent urinary infections: suspicion of vesicoureteral reflux, and urinary symptoms such as urinary incontinence.\n  Congenital malformations of the urinary tract: posterior urethral valve; Prune-Belly Syndrome.\n  Multiple bladder diverticula; previous surgeries of the urinary tract.\n  History of treatment in pelvic area: resection of tumors, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\n  Suspicion or history of bladder obstruction.\n  Suspicion of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (as on EMG).32\n  Spina bifida; occult spinal dysraphism.\n  Cerebral palsy; Anorectal malformation and myelopathies.\n  Spinal malformations; severe scoliosis; sacral agenesis.\n  Other immunologic and neurologic entities.\n  Pre-transplant renal evaluation and follow-up of congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT).\n\n\nIn our initial evaluation of patients with myelomeningocele (n:60), we could perform video urodynamic studies in all the patients within the first 8 months of life on average, and we detected 20% of children with vesicoureteral reflux, 55% with overactivity, 13% with bladder wall hypertonia, and 98% with high PVR.33\n\nThere is a cost to having the additional information provided by video urodynamics: children are exposed to radiation. The weight of the patient and bladder capacity are independent predictors of total exposure to radiation. Being aware of this exposure may help the physician to cautiously use fluoroscopy and better assess parents on the exposure to radiation.34\n\nUnconventional Urodynamics\n\nIn 1996 De Gennaro showed that it is feasible to perform continuous urodynamic monitoring in children and that it has advantages over standard cystometry in the investigation of children with neuropathic bladder even if it is carried out for short term (6 hours).35\n\nWhen there is no correlation between urinary diary volumes (in LUT conditions) or bladder catheterization diary (in neurogenic bladder) and conventional urodynamic results, there is an optional method: urodynamics with spontaneous filling. With this modality it is not necessary to use liquid filling, but the patient must remain longer in hospital, connected to the urodynamic equipment to be monitored. Even though once the patient is admitted they are required to start hydration, the duration of the study is variable and in general it ends when a leakage occurs. During bladder voiding, pressures continue being measured in an alternating way (pressure check and emptying), and then they are correlated with the volumes in a reverse way to standard urodynamics, until voiding ends.\n\nAmbulatory Versus Conventional Urodynamics\n\nConventional urodynamics consists of a highly standardized evaluation. However, when evaluating children, reliability of the measurements may be influenced by the effects of development and variability of data, as well as by the unfamiliar clinical environment. Ambulatory urodynamics provides an alternative to these limitations: it requires natural filling, it is measured during a prolonged period of time, and it is carried out in a friendly environment for children.\n\nLu et al identified different voiding patterns in ambulatory urodynamics in comparison with standard urodynamics, with lack of consistency in the voiding pattern identified with each method.36 Perhaps also considering the last bowel evacuation, the quantity of liquid previously drunk, and the time of the day when the study is performed may explain why less consistent voiding patterns were observed in the ambulatory urodynamic studies.\n\nFinal Considerations\n\nMost LUT entities can be assessed with non-invasive urodynamic tools and can be managed with an adequate treatment and follow-up.\n\nFor some children, invasive urodynamic studies are experienced as a stressful situation in an unfriendly environment. To counteract this scenario and profit from all the benefits of an invasive practice, it is essential to count on trained professional staff with enough patience to support the children and their families.\n\nIt is fundamental that the urodynamic team and all the other professionals involved be aware of the updated standardizations and nomenclatures of entities and of good urodynamic practices, to communicate and report results in a common language. In this way, research will provide more sound findings.\n\nReferences\n\n\nLinde JM, Nijman RJM, Trzpis M, Broens PMA.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nA second trimester comprehensive fetal anatomic survey has become standard prenatal care. Prenatal ultrasound detects 84.4–97% of all fetal urinary tract malformations and these anomalies may be detected as early as 12–14 weeks of gestation.1,2 Prior to routine antenatal screening, symptomatic children with urologic abnormalities were detected after birth, presenting with such symptoms as urosepsis, pain, hematuria, a palpable mass or failure to thrive, often requiring surgical intervention. The advent of routine prenatal ultrasonography has shifted the scope of pediatric urologic care from an interventional/surgical model to an antenatal counseling role.\n\nAntenatal hydronephrosis is seen in 1–5% of all pregnancies and represents the most frequent prenatal diagnosis.3 The majority of these patients have mild renal pelvis dilation that spontaneously resolves; however, hydronephrosis may be secondary to obstruction of the urinary tract, which may or may not benefit from prenatal intervention. As such, a comprehensive knowledge of the pathophysiology of potential urinary tract malformations which may be detected via antenatal screening and their possible prenatal manifestations and intervention is required.\n\nEmbryology\n\nRenal Embryology\n\nThe urinary and genital tracts arise from the intermediate mesoderm. At the fourth week following conception, the mesonephros is formed from two elongated swellings of mesoderm. This rudimentary system temporarily produces urine between 6 and 10 weeks of gestation and will then regress. At 5–6 weeks of gestation, the ureteric bud originates from an outpouching of the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct. The ureteric bud grows cephalad and penetrates the metanephric blastema in week 7. This results in tissue induction of the undifferentiated mesenchyme, transforming it into functioning nephrons of the metanephric kidney (Figure 1) The interaction between the ureteric bud and metanephric blastema is crucial for the creation of functional kidneys and without this occurrence renal agenesis occurs.\n\n\nFigure 1 The sequential development and degeneration of the pronephros and mesonephros and induction of the ureteric bud and metanephric blastema leading to kidney development. Image obtained from Teach Me Anatomy.\n\nThe renal cortex and nephrons develop from the metanephric blastema and the collecting tubules, papillary ducts, calyces, and renal pelvis, and the ureter arises from the ureteric bud. The ureter forms a solid cord of tissue by the sixth week of gestation and undergoes canalization, beginning at the mid-ureteral segment and extending bidirectionally. The ureteropelvic junction and the ureterovesical junction are the last segments to canalize. The membrane that develops during canalization, called Chwalla’s membrane, may contribute to transient/physiologic hydronephrosis and hydroureteronephrosis if there is a delay in its perforation.4 During the tenth week, the nephrons connect to the collecting duct and urine production begins. If the nephrons and collecting system do not join properly, an early obstructive process may occur, which may result in development of a multicystic dysplastic kidney.5\n\nDuring the sixth to ninth weeks of gestation, the kidneys ascend to their final location in the lumbar region. Renal ectopia occurs when the kidneys fail to migrate, with the pelvis being the most common ectopic location. In addition, fusion of the lower poles of the kidneys may result in a horseshoe kidney. With a horseshoe kidney, ascent into the abdomen is restricted by the inferior mesenteric artery, resulting in its ectopic location. A video depicting normal prenatal kidney development is available (Video 1).\n\n\n  \n  Video 1. Depiction of normal prenatal kidney development.\n\n\nBy the tenth week of gestation, the nephron is mature and urine production begins. The kidneys are able to remove sodium and concentrate urea by the 12th to 14th week of gestation and after 18 weeks of intrauterine life, nearly all of the amniotic fluid is fetal urine. This ability of the kidneys to make urine and maintain adequate amniotic fluid volumes has a profound influence on the growth and development of the fetus and plays a key role on fetal lung development.\n\nBladder Embryology\n\nThe development of the anterior abdominal wall, bladder and urorectal septum are also interrelated. At the fifth to sixth week of gestation, the urorectal septum first divides the cloaca into the dorsal anorectal canal and the ventral urogenital sinus. Abnormalities of the cloacal membrane lead to anorectal malformations. The urogenital sinus forms the bladder and urethra and the allantois is the embryonic precursor of the urachal remnant.\n\nThe mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts fuse with the cloaca just prior its subdivision into the urorectal septum. The entrance of the mesonephric ducts distinguishes the cephalad vesicourethral canal from the caudal urogenital sinus. The vesicourethral canal forms the bladder and pelvic urethra. The caudal portion of the urogenital sinus forms the phallic urethra in males and the urethral and vaginal vestibules in females. These normal divisions of the cloaca are depicted in (Figure 2) A detailed video describing normal bladder development is available (Video 2).\n\n\nFigure 2 Normal embryologic division of the cloaca and development of the genitourinary system.\n\n\n  \n  Video 2. Description of normal bladder development.\n\n\nThe cloacal membrane originally defines the ventral wall of the urogenital septum. As the membrane regresses, during gestational week 6, the mesodermal ridges migrate toward the midline to form the final ventral wall. Bladder exstrophy results when the cloacal membrane fails to regress and does not allow the mesoderm to migrate. Cloacal exstrophy occurs when the cloacal membrane regresses before the urorectal septum develops and both the bladder and bowel become exposed.\n\nRenal Function and Amniotic Fluid\n\nThe prognosis of renal abnormalities is worse when amniotic fluid volume is inadequate This poorer prognosis occurs as amniotic fluid is vital for lung development. Before 16 weeks of gestation, the amnion actively transports solutes and water diffuses passively across its membrane. Initially, during the first and second trimesters, the electrolytes and osmolarity of fetal urine is similar to that of fetal and maternal blood. Later in gestation, as the fetal kidney begins to absorb sodium and chloride as tubular function matures, the urine and amniotic fluid become more hypotonic.6 The result is a low electrolyte, high creatinine urinary composition, very similar to that seen postnatally. Kidneys which have sustained prenatal damage produce isotonic urine as they have lost the ability to reabsorb electrolytes and protein.\n\nBefore 16 weeks’ gestation, the amount of amniotic fluid may be relatively normal, even with poor renal function, as most of the amniotic fluid is produced by non-renal sources. After 16 weeks’ gestation, the kidneys become primarily responsible for most of the amniotic fluid volume. By the third trimester, the hourly fetal urine production is as high as 30–40 mL/hour and constitutes around 90% of the amniotic fluid.7\n\nAmniotic fluid has long been recognized as playing an important role in fetal lung development. Reduced amniotic fluid volume results in varying degrees of pulmonary hypoplasia. It is unclear whether amniotic fluid plays merely a mechanical role in fetal lung development or if it supplies renal-derived growth factors. What is clear is its importance in preventing pulmonary hypoplasia, which, when severe, is fatal. Potter’s syndrome (severe pulmonary hypoplasia associated with bilateral renal agenesis), is fatal and occurs when there is a severe renal abnormality or urinary obstruction, resulting in severe oligohydramnios early in gestation.8\n\nEpidemiology\n\nCongenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract9 occur in 1/500 live births and the incidence of neonatal death from CAKUT is about 1/2000 live births.9,10 Hydronephrosis is the most common prenatal urinary abnormality identified, occurring in 1–5% of all pregnancies, with the risk of any postnatal pathology increasing per degree of hydronephrosis (11.9% for mild, 45.1% for moderate and 88.3% for severe hydronephrosis).11 Most obstructive urologic anomalies occur in males, with a male to female ratio of 4:1, with a predilection for the left kidney to be involved,12,13\n\nPathogenesis\n\nFetal uropathy may be caused by genetic issues, such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, or problems associated with nephrogenesis and urinary tract obstruction. Defective nephrogenesis may result in renal agenesis as well as renal dysplasia. Renal dysplasia may result from a defective interaction between the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme, intrinsic defects of differentiation, as well as obstruction. Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract include renal agenesis, multicystic kidney, renal dysplasia, renal duplication anomalies, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, megaureters, posterior urethral valves and vesicoureteral reflux. CAKUT commonly results in renal dysplasia and a possible genetic cause has been considered, as renal abnormalities have been identified in close relatives of 10% of CAKUT patients.9,10 Numerous genetic mutations, such as abnormalities with HNF1β, PAX2 and RET signaling, have been considered, but no clear pattern of inheritance has been identified,14,15\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nAs previously mentioned, prenatal ultrasound detects 84.4–97% of all fetal urinary tract malformations and these anomalies may be detected as early as 12–14 weeks of gestation.1,2 Many of these abnormalities can be diagnosed via ultrasound, with fetal MRI providing greater clarification. In addition, many of these genitourinary conditions overlap in presentation on initial imaging.\n\nPrenatal Ultrasonography\n\nPrenatal ultrasonography is now regularly used as screening and surveillance for fetal growth and development in the second trimester. Detection of urologic anomalies before birth is relatively sensitive, with upwards of 88% of urinary tract abnormalities diagnosed prenatally.16 The kidneys are generally not seen on ultrasound until week 15 of gestation (Figure 3) Anterior-posterior renal pelvic diameter (APRPD) less than 4 mm between weeks 16–27 of gestation and less than 7 mm at week 28 or greater are considered within the normal physiologic range.17 If the ureters are not dilated, they should not be visible on prenatal ultrasound. The bladder can generally be seen at 10 weeks’ gestation but should be visualized by 12 weeks. A normal bladder wall is no thicker than 3 mm.2\n\n\nFigure 3 Prenatal ultrasound depicting normal left and right kidney.\n\nFetal Mri\n\nFetal MRI is commonly utilized to provide more anatomic detail of congenital abnormalities first detected on ultrasound. In one study, the overall diagnostic sensitivity was 96% for fetal MRI compared to 58% for ultrasound.18 Fetal MRI also provides additional diagnostic information, particularly in evaluation of ureteral anatomy. Benefits of fetal MRI include increased tissue contrast and examination of morphology, and ability to detect additional abnormalities and assess fetal renal function.19 As fetal imaging becomes more advanced, techniques such as 3D virtual cystoscopy are being used to further elucidate urogenital abnormalities.20\n\nOn MRI, the bladder will appear as a round/ovoid structure with a uniform high signal and its wall should be smooth and uniform in thickness. The kidneys will be located paraspinally within the upper abdomen and are seen as ovoid structures with an intermediate signal on a T2-weighted sequence. They should be examined for size, dysplastic changes, pelviectasis, and ureterectasis.\n\nPrenatal Anomalies\n\nUpper Urinary Tract Dilation\n\nHydronephrosis is detected in 1–5% of prenatal ultrasounds.21 Upper urinary tract dilation needs to be taken into consideration with other findings, such as the appearance of the renal parenchyma, amniotic fluid volume, ureteral dilation, or the appearance of the fetal bladder and urethral dilation.22,23 The three most common anomalies related to prenatal upper tract dilation are ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) abnormalities, ureterovesical junction (UVJ) abnormalities, and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).\n\nHydronephrosis Grading Systems\n\nTo help better delineate the degree of hydronephrosis, different grading systems have been devised. The main grading systems used for hydronephrosis are the Society for Fetal Urology (SFU)24 and urinary tract dilation (UTD) systems.25 The APRPD has also been used as an adjunct to these grading systems.26\n\nSfu Grading System\n\nIn the SFU system, hydronephrosis grading is based upon the degree of dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces. (Figure 4) depicts the SFU grading system. Importantly, SFU grading was not originally conceived for antenatal evaluation and it has not been widely adopted outside of pediatric urology\n\n\nFigure 4 SFU hydronephrosis grading system.\n\nUtd Hydronephrosis Grading System\n\nThis system is based on six categories that are routinely identified on ultrasound: anterior-posterior renal pelvic diameter (APRPD), dilation of the renal calices, thickness of the renal parenchyma, appearance of the renal parenchyma, bladder abnormalities, and ureteral abnormalities. This grading system is also stratified by gestational age. For prenatal hydronephrosis, the hydronephrosis may be classified as UTD A1: low risk if there is central or calyceal dilation, but all of the aforementioned parameters are normal. UTD A2–3 is used if there is an increased risk for postnatal uropathies. Here, the intermediate (A2) and high risk (A3) groups are grouped into one category (Figure 5)\n\n\nFigure 5 Table depicting the UTD classification system when hydronephrosis presents prenatally.\n\nHydronephrosis/Ureteropelvic Junction\n\nIn most cases of isolated antenatal hydronephrosis, this finding is suggestive of a transient and non-pathologic process.11 UPJ obstruction may be suggested by degree of hydronephrosis. The risk of any postnatal pathology increases significantly based upon the severity of prenatal hydronephrosis. The risk of postnatal pathology for mild, moderate and severe prenatal hydronephrosis has been reported to be 11.9%, 45.1% and 88.3%, respectively.11 Ureterovesical junction obstruction may also be suggested with the finding of hydronephrosis and ureteral dilation.\n\nThe need for further prenatal imaging may be based upon anteroposterior pelvic diameter. In one study, no infants with a second trimester APRPD &lt;7 mm required postnatal intervention and none developed renal insufficiency.27 Another study suggested that a 15 mm renal pelvis dilation was a significant threshold to suspect obstruction in 80% of fetuses, with a sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 82%, respectively.28 In addition, a cutoff of 18 mm for fetal pelvic dilation had been found to have a diagnostic odds ratio of 97.7 for identifying infants who required pyeloplasty.29\n\nVesicoureteral Reflux\n\nIn the 2010 Pediatric Vesicoureteral Reflux Guidelines panel summary report, the authors noted that of the 6,579 infants with prenatal hydronephrosis, VUR was present in 4756 (72%).30 Despite these findings, prenatal imaging has a poor sensitivity in detecting VUR. Even if renal pelvic diameter (RPD) increases on prenatal ultrasound, increasing RPD is not predictive of VUR.31,32 Another study identified, that change in shape/size of the renal pelvis and ureter on prenatal imaging occurred in only 17.2% of fetuses who were diagnosed with postnatal VUR, making this is poor predictor of urinary reflux.32\n\nLower Urinary Tract Obstruction\n\nLower urinary tract obstruction constitutes a group of urogenital abnormalities that result in urethral obstruction. Antenatal presentation of these conditions is similar and generally takes on the form of a distended bladder and hydroureteronephrosis.\n\nIdentifying LUTO is important because of its potential long-term impact on renal function as well as prenatal lung development, especially if associated oligohydramnios is present. Ultrasound and patient characteristics which may be predictive of LUTO are severe megacystis (defined as bladder volume &gt;35 mm3), bilateral ureteral dilation, oligo/anhydroamnios and male fetal sex.33 MRI can assist in evaluating renal parenchyma, kidney size, amount of amniotic fluid, and degree of ureteral and bladder distention.34 In addition, measuring parenchymal area may correlate with postnatal renal function, with 8 cm2 and greater during the third trimester, as the best predictor of end-stage renal disease development.35\n\nPosterior Urethral Valves\n\nPosterior urethral valves can manifest as hydronephrosis, hydroureteronephrosis, or megacystis on prenatal ultrasound. However, the sonographic hallmark of PUV is a keyhole-shaped bladder with mild dilation of the proximal urethra (Figure 6) The prenatal ultrasonographic findings most predictive of the diagnosis of PUV include a dilated posterior urethra (the most discriminatory ultrasound finding), a thickened bladder wall, and anhydroamnios.32\n\n\nFigure 6 Ultrasonographic image depicting the “keyhole” sign commonly seen in posterior urethral valves.\n\nPrune Belly Syndrome\n\nAs the severity of PBS is variable, its antenatal diagnosis is difficult. Generally, the kidneys appear hyperechoic and dysplastic, with dilation of the ureters and a thickened bladder wall. Anhydroamnios and compressed abdominal and thoracic contents may also be seen.36,37 The earlier the suspicion for PBS occurs on prenatal imaging, the worse the prognosis. MRI can further delineate the extent of genitourinary abnormalities, including renal hypoplasia, dysplasia, ureteral dilation, megacystis, dilated prostatic urethra, and prostatic hypoplasia.34\n\nUrethral Atresia and Anterior Urethral Abnormalities\n\nUrethral atresia is just one condition under the umbrella of anterior urethral anomalies, which also includes anterior urethral valves and urethral diverticulum. Urethral atresia and anterior urethral anomalies are rare, but may be suspected when finding hydroureteronephrosis, a dilated and thickened bladder, oligohydramnios, as well as a dilated urethra on prenatal imaging. Additional congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract increase the likelihood of developing chronic kidney disease.38\n\nMulticystic Dysplastic Kidney\n\nPrenatal renal cystic disease is difficult to identify and distinguish using only ultrasound. Often, it may be difficult to distinguish MCDK from a severe UPJ obstruction on prenatal ultrasound. Fetal MRI has been used to complement initial ultrasound findings concerning for MCDK. Classically, the kidney will be completely replaced by cysts of different sizes that do not communicate (Figure 7) A normal renal pelvis is typically not seen, due to lack of tubular branching development and may be a characteristic finding for MCDK.39 Beyond MCDK, renal cysts found on prenatal imaging can also be indicative of renal cystic dysplasia/disease.\n\n\nFigure 7 Ultrasound image depicting MCDK. Yellow arow depicts renal cyst. Green arrow depicts echogenic thinned renal parenchyma suggestive of renal dysplasia.\n\nDuplication Anomalies\n\nThe diagnostic accuracy of prenatal ultrasound in identifying isolated duplex collecting systems is as high as 90%.40 When there is ureteral duplication, a ureterocele may be associated with the upper pole moiety. Even though most duplication anomalies may be diagnosed using ultrasonography (Figure 8), MRI may be helpful in distinct cases.41 One study reported that in patients with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated duplex collecting system, ureterocele and megaureter were associated with 70.7% and 36.6% of cases, respectively.40\n\n\nFigure 8 A. Ultrasound image depicting duplicated kidney with hydronephrosis within lower pole (green arrow) and upper pole (red arrow). B. Ultrasound image depicting urinary bladder with ureterocele (yellow arrow) within it.\n\nBladder Exstrophy, Cloaca, Urogenital Sinus\n\nBladder exstrophy and cloacal exstrophy may also be seen on prenatal imaging. The correct differentiation between bladder exstrophy and cloacal exstrophy may be accomplished by identifying the location of umbilical cord insertion relative to the abdominal wall defect (superior vs. mid vs. inferior), which can be accomplished either with fetal ultrasound or MRI.42 If the defect in the abdominal wall is seen inferior to the cord without a full bladder, the diagnosis is likely bladder exstrophy. Meanwhile, if the defect is at the level of the cord or superior to it, the diagnosis is more likely an omphalocele.\n\nBladder exstrophy on MRI will be seen as an infraumbilical abdominal wall mass, with low insertion of the umbilical cord. Because the kidneys and ureters should be normal, there will be a normal amount of amniotic fluid. Diastasis of the pubic symphysis may also be noted.\n\nPrenatal ultrasound findings suggestive of classic cloaca malformations include one to two adjacent cysts seen in the female fetal pelvis, transient ascites, and high position of the rectum with superior dilation and blunted or beaked distal tapering as well as hydronephrosis and megacystis. The most specific features supporting the diagnosis of cloacal malformation is a fluid-filled dilated colon with enteroliths and presence of meconium in the urinary tract. Additional findings on fetal MRI suggestive of cloacal exstrophy include an absent bladder with normal amniotic fluid volume, protuberant anterior pelvic contour, lack of meconium in the bowel, and omphalocele.43 Fetal MRI can also contribute to the identification of the number and location of perineal orifices.\n\nIn persistent urogenital sinus, fetal ultrasound may show hydrometrocolpos as an oblong, anechoic, and septate lesion located behind the fetal bladder.44 On MRI, a urogenital sinus will present with a normal rectum and colon caliber. The meconium signal will also be normal. The anal perineal orifice will be in its physiologic location. There will be a common urogenital channel with an orifice on the perineum where the urethra should be located.45\n\nTreatment Options\n\nFrom a urologic perspective, most prenatal interventions are performed for lower urinary tract obstruction. Interventions are performed to alleviate the obstruction, in an attempt to maximize renal function and normalize amniotic fluid levels to prevent damage associated with oligohydramnios.\n\nThere are two current widely accepted interventions for prenatal LUTO: vesicoamniotic shunt placement and fetal cystoscopy. Fetal intervention is primarily focused on the decompression of the upper urogenital tract to prevent ongoing renal parenchymal damage and restoration of amniotic fluid volume for pulmonary development. Prior to consideration of any prenatal intervention, evaluation is necessary for risk assessment for intervention and should begin with two consecutive vesicocenteses.46,47,48,49 In conjunction with the sonographic appearance of the kidneys, utilization of the Glick criteria can be used as a prognostic factor for further fetal intervention in addition to a therapeutic intervention (Table 1)50 It is worth noting that this prognostication is not adjusted for fetal age and is not necessarily reflective of postnatal function.48\n\nTable 1 Prognostic Criteria for Fetus with Obstructive Uropathy\n\n\n  \n    \n      Predicted function\n      Amniotic fluid status at time of initial presentation\n      Sonographic appearance of kidneys\n      Fetal urine – sodium (mEq/mL)\n      Fetal urine – chloride (mEq/mL)\n      Fetal urine – osmolarity (mOsm)\n      Fetal urine output (mL/hour)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Poor\n      Moderate to severely decreased\n      Echogenic to cystic\n      &gt; 100\n      &gt; 90\n      &gt; 210\n      &lt; 2\n    \n    \n      Good\n      Normal to moderately decreased\n      Normal to echogenic\n      &lt; 100\n      &lt; 90\n      &lt; 210\n      &gt; 2\n    \n  \n\n\nVesicoamniotic Shunting\n\nVesicoamniotic shunting is performed with local anesthesia under real-time, two-dimensional ultrasound guidance.51,52 Under sterile technique, a vesicoamniotic catheter is percutaneously inserted with optimal placement where the distal end of the shunt lies in the fetal bladder and the proximal end in the amniotic cavity (Figure 9)52 Early models detail the use of double-ended pigtail catheters, while more recent studies have explored double-basket catheters as an alternative modality. Variable outcomes have been reported, with survival rates ranging from 41% to 80%, depending on patient selection,53,54 The most recent randomized PLUTO trial encountered significant issues with patient recruitment, leading to premature termination of the study while trying to provide further clarity on the utility of vesicoamniotic shunting.52 This study, along with other small retrospective analyses and anecdotal evidence, has shown an improvement in perinatal survival,53,54,55 although longer term outcomes remain unclear. All studies highlight the need for further prospective, randomized control studies for this intervention.\n\n\nFigure 9 Depiction of ultrasonographic guidance placing a vesicoamniotic shunt, final shunt placement and an ultrasound showing the shunt (blue arrow) within the urinary bladder (yellow arrow) and amniotic space (red arrow).\n\nCystoscopy\n\nIn utero fetal cystoscopy was first reported in 1995.56 Although technically more challenging than vesicoamniotic shunting, this intervention allows for direct visualization, ascertainment of a specific diagnosis, and possible treatment at time of diagnosis. A trocar larger than that used for vesicoamniotic shunting is utilized and a 1.0–1.3 mm fetoscope in a curved sheath with at least a 70° field of view is used.57 One of the most common anomalies noted on fetal cystoscopy is posterior urethral valves (PUV). If a membranous structure is noted on cystoscopy and PUV is diagnosed, laser fulguration, hydroablation, or guide-wire perforation may be used as methods of immediate intervention (Figure 10)58 Urethral stenosis is an intraoperative cystoscopic diagnosis that may be successfully treated with a urethral stent placement over a wire.57 If urethral atresia is instead diagnosed, perforation of the urethra is not attempted, and VAS is completed.59\n\n\nFigure 10 Image A depicts how fetal cystoscopy is performed.

In addition, a podcast reviewing prenatal interventions for LUTO is available.\n\n\n  \n  Video 3. Depiction of fetal intervention for LUTO.\n\n\nComplications\n\nPrenatal interventions for LUTO are not without risk and possible complication. One risk associated with both VAS and in-utero fetal cystoscopy is premature rupture of membranes, which may lead to preterm labor.60 Vesicoamniotic shunting complications include risk of shunt blockage and dislodgement, both of which can result in fetal demise.55 In addition, reports of misplacement of the shunt into surrounding intra-abdominal organs have been reported.61 Fetal cystoscopy with laser ablation has been associated with a 10% fistula rate which varied by gestational age, curved versus semi-curved sheaths, laser type and settings, as well as operator experience in a statistically significant manner.62\n\nConclusions\n\nUrologic abnormalities are commonly detected on the routine prenatal second trimester comprehensive fetal anatomic survey. The most common abnormality identified is prenatal hydronephrosis, which typically is transient. However, other genitourinary abnormalities detected prenatally may have worse outcome. In particular, lower urinary tract obstruction can lead to marked morbidity and mortality in the fetus. At times, prenatal treatment may be warranted in attempts to preserve renal function and prevent pulmonary hypoplasia.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Antenatal hydronephrosis is seen in 1–5% of all pregnancies and represents the most frequent prenatal diagnosis.\n  Prenatal Anterior-Posterior Renal Pelvic Diameter ( APRPD) less then 4 mm between weeks 16–27 of gestation and less then 7 mm at week 28 or greater of gestation are considered within the physiologic range.\n  There are many urogenital conditions and abnormalities that are detected via prenatal imaging. Many of these can be diagnosed via ultrasound, with fetal MRI providing greater clarification.\n  Lower urinary tract obstruction without intervention can lead to marked morbidity and mortality in the fetus. Although several treatment modalities exist, large scale studies are required to determine efficacy in preserving renal function and preventing pulmonary hypoplasia.\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Lee RS, Cendron M, Kinnamon DD, Nguyen HT.

        "title": "General Anesthesia Considerations In Children",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nPediatric urology procedures cover a wide range of patient types, surgical approaches, and a broad spectrum of anesthetic requirements and approaches. Anesthesia plans may vary to include anesthesia for same-day outpatient surgery procedures in healthy patients with an isolated urologic concern or they may be more involved and complex.\n\nAnesthesia in medically complex patients or those involving multiple stages of surgical intervention may include multimodal analgesia, various neuraxial or regional anesthetic block techniques in addition to general anesthesia and may require inpatient stays where postoperative acute pain services can be provided. Medically complex patients may benefit from a visit to the pre-anesthesia or pre-surgical optimization clinic to ensure that all follow-up information is up to date (e.g., echocardiogram and cardiology clearance in patients with congenital heart disease) and to allow for timely completion of any necessary laboratory work or imaging.\n\nGood pre-operative communication between the surgical and anesthesia teams is ideal and may include any special peri-operative needs, anticipated post-operative admission or pain issues.\n\nParents may have accessed information regarding anesthesia online or they may have questions for the urologist regarding anesthetics. These parents can typically be reassured that they will speak to an anesthesia provider on the day of surgery, or they can be provided with the anesthesia group’s contact information for further questions.\n\nPreoperative Assessment\n\nAnxiolysis\n\nPreoperative anxiety in children can result in significant morbidity and postoperative behavior changes. Data from the US and Europe have shown that up to 54% of patients will exhibit general anxiety, nightmares, nighttime crying, enuresis, separation anxiety, and temper tantrums for 2 weeks after their surgical procedure. Some children continue to have maladaptive behavior changes 6 months to a 1 year after their procedure. The quality of their medical experience is crucial in limiting postoperative behavior changes and decreasing anxiety in subsequent visits. Several methods are available to help decrease patients’ preoperative anxiety and improve their perioperative experience.1\n\nBoth pharmacologic agents and distraction technologies can be effective in anxious children.2 Separation anxiety begins around the age of 1 year. Situational anxiety peaks in the preschool- age child. Therefore, we administer an oral anxiolytic (such as midazolam oral liquid, 0.5–0.75 mg/kg) in the pre-operative holding area 15–30 minutes prior to inhalational anesthesia induction to allow optimal timing of medication effect. Intranasal and intramuscular delivery of pharmacologic agents are other options for anxiolytic administration.\n\nDevelopmentally normal children are generally able to sit for an intravenous (IV) catheter placement in pre-operative holding at our institution after the age of 7 years, so it is more typical to offer an IV induction for older children, though inhalational induction may still be more feasible in certain patients. Child life specialists (persons trained to provide distraction and reassurance to children during medical visits) are available to teach coping skills, provide play, description of induction process and assist with IV placement. Additional devices may be used, such as jet-delivered buffered lidocaine (creates a wheal of numb skin using pressurized lidocaine and no needle) through which the IV catheter can be inserted, causing minimal pain. Topical anesthetics may also be applied to the skin, if timing allows, for reducing the pain of IV placement.3\n\nParental presence for induction can also help decrease anxiety and increase parental satisfaction. Some parents may prefer to be present regardless of the age of their child. Certain patient populations, such as those with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, sometimes do better when familiar individuals such as parents or care providers are present. Although parental presence for induction may be appropriate, studies have shown that pharmacologic premedication to treat anxiety is superior to parental presence for induction. A highly anxious parent or those with disruptive behaviors can hinder the induction process. Furthermore, parental presence for induction does not affect postoperative behavior changes, whereas oral midazolam has been shown to decrease immediate negative postoperative behavior outcomes in young children. The final decision to invite parents back to the operating suite should be made by the anesthesia team after the preoperative interview and a discussion of the anesthetic plan. Generally, parental presence for induction has been discouraged during the current pandemic except in very special circumstances.1\n\nAcute Illnesses\n\nCommunicable Illnesses\n\n\n  Delay elective procedures to avoid infecting others with communicable diseases.\n  Chicken pox: no longer communicable once all skin lesions have crusted over.4,5\n  Hand-Foot-Mouth disease: no longer communicable 3 weeks following resolution of rash.5,6\n\n\nRespiratory Infections\n\nA common conundrum in pediatric anesthesia practice is anesthetizing the well versus the unwell child. Certain pathogens and the subsequent reactivity of the airway mucosa can lead to complications with anesthesia. Following a cold with a cough, or uncomplicated upper airway infection (URI), airway reactivity may remain elevated for weeks. It is our policy to postpone elective procedures until four weeks after full resolution of symptoms of URI, or 6 weeks after symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection (LRI), such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, or pneumonia. This allows airway reactivity to return to baseline and reduces the risk of intraoperative anesthesia complications such as bronchospasm, laryngospasm, hypoxia, and unplanned post-operative admission.7,8\n\nGenerally, symptoms of URI and LRI are identified during the pre-operative screening phone call and cases can be cancelled with adequate time to fill the gap in the surgical schedule. But what should be done with the patient who is currently presenting for their case in pre-operative holding and who has “just” developed a runny nose, fever, cough, or a constellation of new symptoms? Certain aspects of a URI, such as green nasal discharge, wheezing on pulmonary auscultation, or fever within 48 hours, increase the relative risk of airway events enough to make day-of-surgery cancellation an easy decision.9 However, the case may not always be as clear-cut, with symptoms of an isolated clear rhinorrhea and occasional dry cough, for example. The patient may have had pre-operative testing; the parents may have taken the day off work; the child may be appropriately fasting; and day-of-surgery cancellations are inconvenient for everyone involved. It is our practice to assess each child on a case-by-case basis with safety as our primary goal, ruling out signs of florid illness such as active fever, and taking into account the urgency of the surgical procedure and any extenuating circumstances, such as when there has been a long distance traveled, or when child is frequently ill to the point where finding a four-week block of symptom-free recovery may be almost impossible, or when there is limited parental work leave to care for the child, which might make rescheduling the case particularly difficult. We also include parents in the decision-making process, letting them know that, although the overall absolute risk is low, anesthesia in the setting of an active upper respiratory infection may present more risk than in a well child. Risk stratification by symptom type and duration and patient risk factors such as passive smoke exposure, age, and asthma, is supported in the literature with general recommendations to proceed with mild symptoms in low-risk patients and reschedule for significant symptoms in those who are at higher risk.1\n\nSARS-CoV-2\n\nA retrospective cohort study at a large academic pediatric hospital revealed that each child with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the 10 days prior to a procedure had a much higher incidence of respiratory complications (11.8% vs 1.0%, 95% CI 1.6-19.8%, p = 0.003) when compared to matched controls. Given the additional infectivity risk to other patients in proximity and to medical staff, it is our recommendation to electively test every patient preoperatively for SARS-CoV-2 and to reschedule elective cases when there is a newly positive COVID-19 test.10\n\nAsthma\n\nElective surgeries should be postponed until therapy for patients with poor control of symptoms has been optimized. Procedures for those with acute asthma exacerbations should be delayed for 4 weeks following resolution and return to baseline. Patients should consistently use their preventative asthma medications in the weeks and days prior to anesthesia.11,12\n\nMedical Comorbidities\n\nDepending on presentation of the disease state (acute, subacute, chronic) and the urgency of a surgical procedure, the pediatric urology patient may present in perfect health or with a spectrum of hemodynamic derangements, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.\n\nPatients with complex medical comorbidities should be seen in the preoperative clinic to ensure that medical conditions have been optimally controlled prior to surgery. Early referral to the preoperative clinic allows for sufficient time to effectively initiate an optimization program and to manage modifiable risks. Patients receiving maintenance medications for their chronic medical conditions should continue those medications in the perioperative period.13,14\n\nPreoperative Fasting Guidelines\n\nThere are guidelines for reducing the risk of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving medications that reduce protective airway reflexes. The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends that patients fast from fatty solid foods for 8 hours prior to surgery. Fasting recommendations for light meals, any non-clear beverage, non-human milk, and artificial enteral nutrition is 6 hours. Breast milk should be stopped for 4 hours, and clear liquids for 2 hours prior to anesthesia.15 The Canadian Anesthesiologists’ Society has similar guidelines, but the Canadian Pediatric Anesthesia Society now encourages children to have clear liquids up to one hour prior to surgery.16 The European Society of Anesthesiology fasting guidelines prohibit solid foods 6 hours prior to surgery and encourages adult patients to have clear liquids up to 2 hours and pediatric patients to have clear liquids up to 1 hour before surgery.17\n\nThere have been concerns that guidelines on clear liquids may be too rigid and may contribute to poor outcomes. Due to the unpredictability of surgical suites, a 2-hour clear liquid fasting in reality translates to a much longer fasting period. Prolonged fasting can increase discomfort and result in detrimental physiologic and metabolic effects. It is also difficult to enforce fasting guidelines for young children. Proponents of gastric ultrasounds have suggested that a measurement of gastric contents may be more reliable than fasting instructions alone. A gastric ultrasound should be obtained prior to cancellation or delay of a case due to NPO violation.\n\nAnesthetic Considerations\n\nGeneral Versus Spinal Anesthesia\n\nApplication of Spinal Anesthesia\n\nSpinal anesthesia is a good anesthetic option for patients undergoing procedures below the umbilicus.18 Technically speaking, there is no age limit for a spinal anesthetic. However, outside the neonatal and infant time frame a pure spinal anesthetic is unlikely to be successful without anxiolytics or sedation, given the patients’ cognitive development and inability to cooperate with spinal anesthetic placement and surgical procedure. Ex-premature infants often have a history of apnea of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and chronic lung disease. Their risk for postoperative apnea is further increased compared to infants born at full term.19 When feasible, a spinal anesthetic would help decrease the potential risks associated with general anesthesia, such as neurotoxicity, apnea, and adverse cardiopulmonary events. Spinal anesthesia should be considered for patients in whom general anesthesia may pose an increased risk, such as those with facial dysmorphia, difficult airway, muscular dystrophy, or a family history of malignant hyperthermia.\n\nHemodynamic changes secondary to sympathectomy from a spinal or epidural anesthetic common in adults are not seen in young children. Children have relatively immature sympathetic nervous systems and are less dependent on vasomotor tone to maintain blood pressure. Furthermore, they have smaller venous capacitance in the lower extremity and thus less blood pooling.\n\nContraindications to Spinal Anesthesia\n\nSpinal anesthesia is limited to surgeries lasting 90 minutes or less. Children have larger cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSF) and faster turnover of CSF compared to adults. Given this difference, spinal anesthesia typically lasts longer in older children and adults compared to neonates and infants. A single injection spinal anesthetic will typically last 60-90 minutes and may be extended to 120 minutes if done in combination with a caudal block.\n\nContraindications include coagulopathies, systemic infection, or local infection at site of puncture, uncorrected hypovolemia, parental refusal, and an uncooperative patient. Neurologic abnormalities such as spina bifida and increased intracranial pressure are also contraindications for spinal anesthesia.\n\nComplications\n\nComplications following spinal anesthesia include traumatic puncture leading to bleeding, pain and injury to the structures surrounding puncture site. With careful aseptic techniques the incidence of serious infectious complications such as meningitis is very low.20 Respiratory and cardiovascular insufficiency can result from a high spinal anesthetic. Neurologic injury and local anesthetic toxicity can result from injection of incorrect solution or dose of local anesthetic, respectively. Post-dural puncture headache is another complication of spinal anesthesia. However, the incidence of PDPH is unknown in younger children due to the difficulty in assessing headaches in that population.\n\nLaparoscopic and Robotic Considerations\n\nRobotic and laparoscopic urologic approaches are increasing.21 These approaches present unique changes to ventilation, venous return, hemodynamics, and abdominopelvic organ perfusion during the case. A general anesthetic with endotracheal intubation is required for these types of cases since awake patients cannot tolerate peritoneum insufflation. Furthermore, laparoscopic procedures typically require muscle relaxation to optimize surgical conditions. Pneumoperitoneum often contributes to a reversible oliguria or anuria and similar hemodynamic and respiratory changes as seen in adult laparoscopy.\n\nTable 1 Physiologic changes in response to laparoscopy.

The benefits of a caudal anesthetic include decreased need for intraoperative and postoperative pain medications, decreased stress hormone response and increased overall patient and parental satisfaction.23\n\nCaudal blocks are an injection of local anesthetic into the epidural space accessed via the sacral hiatus. The bony landmarks of the hiatus are generally palpable in young pediatric patients or visualized using ultrasound.\n\n\nFigure 1 Anatomic approach to caudal block using palpation of bony landmarks.

Failure most often occurs due to inappropriate anatomic location of injectate (e.g., subcutaneous, intravascular), which may initially go unrecognized.\n\nCaudal Block Complications\n\nRisks include bleeding, infection, nerve damage, inadvertent dural puncture and post-dural puncture headache, allergic reaction, and local anesthetic toxicity. The most common adverse event is the inability to place a block or block failure.20\n\nAge Limit\n\nWhile some centers limit caudal blocks to non-ambulatory (infant) populations, caudal blocks can be safe and effective in older children as well. In our pediatric practice, we often perform caudal blocks on older children, depending on habitus, for surgeries in which a sacral level of pain control is desirable (e.g., circumcision). In larger (over 50 kg) or older children, an at-level single shot lumbar epidural is generally straightforward but may exhibit sacral sparing due to the relatively large sacral nerve roots, and is thus more ideally suited for a lumbar level of analgesia (e.g., for a Pfannenstiel incision).2,24 Adult studies suggest a higher-than-expected rate of accidental intravascular injection when confirmatory caudal epidurography is performed.25 Anatomic changes to habitus, ossification of the sacrococcygeal membrane, and changes in the epidural space may also lead to a preferred access point at the lumbar or thoracic spine for neuraxial blocks in older, larger children and adults.\n\nHypospadias Rate of Complications\n\nHypospadias repair is a common urologic procedure in young males. Published reports have primarily looked at the impact of surgical techniques and severity of defects on the incidence of surgical complications. In recent years, there have been controversial reports on the effect of anesthetic technique on the rate of postsurgical complications such as urethrocutaneous fistula or glanular dehiscence.\n\nIn a randomized study comparing the efficacy of penile block and caudal anesthesia for hypospadias repairs, Kundra et al incidentally noted an increased incidence of urethrocutaneous fistula in patients who received a caudal block.26 It is important to note the small N of 54, and that the children in this study were age 4 to 12 years; older than the contemporary recommended age for hypospadias repair. Some studies have found older patient age as a risk factor for complications.27,28 Furthermore, surgery was performed by both urology and plastic surgeons and surgical techniques were different in the caudal block group compared to penile block group.\n\nTaicher et al., in a review of primary hypospadias repairs performed by a single surgeon from 2001-2014, found that complications were associated with caudal blocks, proximal hypospadias, increased surgical duration, and surgeon’s earlier year of practice.29 After adjusting for confounders through multivariate logistic regression analysis, they concluded that both caudal blocks and proximal hypospadias remained highly associated with postoperative complications. The authors did note the routine use of lidocaine with epinephrine by their surgeon during all but the minimal glanular cases. However, since the information on usage of subcutaneous epinephrine was not captured on a consistent basis in their database, they cannot comment on whether it played a role in their findings.\n\nZaidi et al found that location of urethral opening (proximal &gt;distal shaft) was strongly associated with urethrocutaneous fistula development. In contrast to Taicher et al., their analysis of a subgroup that underwent tubularized repair of distal urethral opening revealed no association between fistula formation and the use of caudal blocks, but found an association between fistula formation and subcutaneous epinephrine usage.29,30 Similarly, Barga et al found only an association between proximal hypospadias and fistula formation after multivariate analysis.31\n\nA systemic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized observational studies found no association between caudal blocks and postoperative complications.32 The advantage of a meta-analysis is its ability to increase the number of observations and therefore statistical power. But we must keep in mind that meta-analysis is limited by the biases and limitations of the source data.\n\nCaudal blocks, when compared with penile nerve block (PNB), was found to have a lower rate of hypospadias revision surgery, despite earlier reports suggesting the opposite.33\n\nThe mechanism by which caudal blocks might contribute to postsurgical complications is unclear. It has been hypothesized that blood pooling secondary to sympathectomy leads to penile engorgement, postoperative edema, and poor wound healing.26 Others would argue that increased arterial blood flow secondary to caudal block decreases tissue ischemia.33\n\nEpidural Catheter\n\nFor painful procedures requiring an inpatient stay, or for select patients in whom longer term neuraxial analgesia is desirable, a caudal or epidural catheter is advantageous for increased duration of regional pain control. At our institution, many of our patients will be “fast tracked” after a planned repair (e.g., discharge on post-operative day one) such as an open ureteral reimplant and are more frequently given single-injection caudal blocks with an adjunct to prolong blockade. Patients who have more complex repairs and who will need a longer post-operative stay, or those with a history of pain control issues, are discussed between the urology and anesthesia acute pain teams before surgery and are given epidural catheters. This allows for continuous infusion of local anesthetic post-operatively. The epidural infusion may be paused to determine whether the patient is able to manage their pain on an oral regimen prior to discharge. Should the trial be successful, the catheter can be removed, generally the day before discharge.\n\nTruncal Blocks\n\nIlioinguinal nerve block is an option for single-sided inguinal scrotal procedures when a caudal block is not appropriate due to age, anatomical challenges, or patient refusal. Pre-incisional block placement is preferable since it would allow for decrease of intraoperative intravenous analgesics usage. However, infiltration with local anesthetic may distort anatomy for the surgeon.\n\nMedications and Adjuncts to Regional Blocks\n\nThe most common local anesthetics used in our pediatric regional anesthesia practice are ropivacaine and bupivacaine, both used at 0.125–0.25%, and given most typically at 1 cc/kg to obtain a sacral level of analgesia. Generally, we use at least epinephrine as an adjunct, which also serves to indicate if inadvertent intravascular injection has occurred. Epinephrine adjuvants intravascularly increase patient heart rate and occasionally cause EKG changes during a “test dose” (i.e. a small amount of the local anesthetic containing epinephrine, which is injected first, then followed by a short waiting period to look for any EKG or vital sign changes).\n\nTo obtain a higher level of blockade, additional injectate volume can be used by diluting the local anesthetic concentration (e.g., 1 cc/kg local anesthetic plus 0.5 cc/kg diluent such as preservative-free normal saline).\n\nThe most common adjuncts to local anesthetics used in our practice are clonidine (generally 1 mcg/kg), fentanyl (1 mcg/kg) and hydromorphone (5–10 mcg/kg). An association between caudal opioid use and increased post-operative nausea and vomiting has been noted.34 There is no significant difference in duration of action or adverse events when using clonidine vs. morphine (preservative free) as an adjunct. Thus, we limit the use of opioid as an adjunct (with or without clonidine) to patients who are at lower risk for development of post-operative nausea and vomiting and who stand to benefit more strongly from an increased duration of blockade (e.g, larger incision, more painful procedures). Clonidine is generally avoided in the neonate population due to concerns for apnea and bradycardia.\n\nUse of dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to caudal anesthesia has been linked to higher sedation scores and higher incidence of bradycardia.35\n\nMultimodal Analgesia\n\nMultimodal analgesia combines the use of nerve block, opioid, and non-opioid pain medications to optimize pain control.\n\nNSAIDs\n\nDespite lack of strong, large-scale evidence regarding its efficacy, ketorolac is likely safe and currently is widely used in the peri-operative period.36 Ketorolac is indicated, for short-term use only, in acutely painful conditions. It is not indicated for mild pain and is contraindicated in those patients with advanced renal disease and those who are inadequately volume resuscitated. Using it at the lowest effective dose (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg IV or less) is associated with analgesia equal to higher doses but with minimal side effects. Ketorolac should also be avoided in patients at high risk of bleeding or gastrointestinal ulcer disease. Practice among anesthesiologists varies, but recent literature suggests use in healthy neonates (at least 3 weeks old and not preterm) and infants is not associated with increased adverse effects.37,38\n\nAcetaminophen\n\nAcetaminophen is the most used non-opioid analgesic in the pediatric population for treating mild to moderate pain. It is available in multiple formulations and concentrations and may be administered orally, rectally and intravenously. Dosing varies depending on route of administration, patient age and intravenous formulation available. Acetaminophen carries a low risk of serious side effects. Hepatotoxicity is the major serious side effect and is most often associated with overdose, both intentional and unintentional.39 Administration should be avoided in patients with prolonged vomiting, prolonged fasting, dehydration and hepatic impairment.40\n\nPostoperative Concerns\n\nPONV\n\nOne common potentially preventable side effect of surgery and anesthesia is postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). PONV can result in significant discomfort as well as decreased patient satisfaction.41 Combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy. Anesthetic considerations to reduce the risk of PONV include regional anesthesia and multimodal analgesia to reduce the need for perioperative opioids, adequate preoperative hydration by minimizing fasting times, adequate intraoperative hydration, avoidance of volatile anesthetics, and prophylactic treatment with pharmacologic agents.42,43\n\nTable 2 Postoperative nausea and vomiting risk factors in pediatric patients.

Ondansetron and dexamethasone are the two most commonly used agents in the pediatric population.42 Scopolamine transdermal patch typically not used in children under the age of 12 years. The British National Formulary for Children recommends the use of a quarter of a patch from the ages of 1 month to 3 years and a half of a patch from ages 3–10 years. Metoclopramide can also cause tardive dyskinesia.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Medication\n      Site of Action\n      Dosing\n      Side Effects\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Ondansetron\n      Serotonin 5-HT3 antagonist\n      0.1–0.15mg/kg IV (max 4 mg)\n      Prolonged QT interval\n    \n    \n      Dexamethasone\n      Not well understood\n      0.15 mg/kg IV\n      Tumor lysis syndrome\n    \n    \n      Scopolamine\n      Acetylcholine M-1 antagonist\n      1.5 mg transdermal patch\n      Dry mouth, visual disturbances, sedation\n    \n    \n      Aprepitant\n      Neurokinin-1 antagonist\n      1 mg/kg PO (max 40 mg)\n      Rare\n    \n    \n      Lorazepam\n      GABA agonist\n      0.05 mg/kg IV (max 2 mg)\n      Sedation\n    \n    \n      Diphenhydramine\n      Histamine H-1 antagonist\n      1 mg/kg IV (max 50 mg)\n      Sedation\n    \n    \n      Metoclopramide\n      Dopamine D-2 antagonist\n      0.1–0.25 mg/kg IV (max 20 mg)\n      Prolonged QT interval\n    \n  \n\n\nApnea\n\nFormer preterm infants have been found to be at increased risk for postoperative apnea. Risk for apnea diminishes for patients born at later gestational age. Cote et al found in their cornerstone study that the incidence of apnea is strongly related to gestational and post conceptual age, and that the overall incidence is markedly diminished after 43 weeks post conceptual age. In patients born at gestational age of 35 weeks, the incidence of apnea decreases to less than 5% after 48 weeks post conceptual age and to less than 1% after 54 weeks post conceptual age. In those who were born at 32 weeks, they saw a decrease in incidence of apnea to less than 5% and less than 1% after post conceptual age of 50 weeks and 56 weeks, respectively.19\n\nGeneral anesthesia can unmask abnormalities of ventilatory control and therefore also a propensity toward apnea not previously noted in a former preterm or even term infant. General anesthesia decreases muscle tone, resulting in upper airway obstruction which contributes to apnea; therefore, it is reasonable to infer that spinal anesthesia would decrease the risk of apnea. Davidson et al similarly found prematurity to be the strongest predictor of apnea. They saw a reduction of apneic events in the first 30 minutes, a decrease in degree of desaturation and level of intervention needed for apneic spells with awake spinal anesthesia compared to general anesthesia. They did not find a difference in the incidence of late apnea (apnea in 30 minutes to 12 hours after anesthesia). Nonetheless, their trial did not include infants born extremely premature (younger than 26 weeks gestation) or those with significant comorbidities. It is possible that the benefits of spinal anesthesia for apnea is different in those populations.45\n\nGiven the above, infants undergoing procedures requiring anesthesia (sedation, spinal anesthesia, and general anesthesia) should be admitted for observation. Admission should be for at least 23 hours following anesthesia and should include continuous pulse oximetry. Admissions requirement varies from institution to institution. Our institution has conservatively required post anesthetic admission for infants with a history of prematurity (born at &lt; 37 weeks gestational age) who are less than 60 weeks post conceptual age. For otherwise healthy full-term infants, admission after anesthesia is not required after 44 weeks post conceptual age. Children with significant comorbidities should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nUnexpected Complications\n\nParents should always be prepared for possible admissions, especially in patient younger than 60 weeks post conceptual age. Moreover, patients with recent or current mild respiratory symptoms may require admission secondary to overly reactive airways.\n\nUpdate on Pediatric Anesthesia and Neurotoxicity\n\nThere are ongoing concerns about anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity in the developing brain. How do we balance the potential risks associated with anesthesia and the optimal timing of surgical interventions? In animal models, including non-human primates, exposure to commonly used general anesthetic agents, such as halogenated volatiles, propofol, and ketamine, result in a range of morphologic and functional changes. Exposed animals have been found to have apoptotic neuronal cell death, glial death, impaired neurogenesis, and abnormal axon formation. In some, exposure in infancy has been associated with altered behavior, and impairment of learning and memory formation lasting into early adulthood. Exposure appears to be dose-, exposure length- and sex-dependent. Compared to their female counterparts, male rodents exhibited impairment in contextual learning and memory despite comparable neuronal cell death.46 However, it is difficult to translate results from animal models to humans since dosages used in these studies are significantly higher than those typically used for humans.47\n\nThere is mixed evidence from cohort and retrospective studies that young children exposed to anesthesia are at increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Some studies have suggested an increased risk of behavioral developmental disorders with multiple exposures but not with a single exposure. DiMaggio et al performed a meta-analysis of selected studies published from 2008 to 2012 and concluded that the results indicated a modest, but elevated risk.48\n\nO’Leary et al conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, by linking provincial health administrative databases to children’s developmental outcomes measured by the Early Development Instrument (EDI). Children who underwent surgery before EDI completion (age 5 to 6 year) were matched to unexposed children. The primary outcome was early developmental vulnerability, defined as any domain of the EDI in the lowest tenth percentile of the population. Subgroup analyses were performed based on age at first surgery (less than 2 years and greater than or equal to 2 years) and frequency of surgery. The authors concluded that children who underwent surgery before primary school age were at increased risk of early developmental vulnerability, but the magnitude of the difference between exposed and unexposed children was small. Age less than 2 year at first exposure and multiple exposures to surgery were not risk factors for adverse developmental outcomes.49\n\nPopulation-based study in Australia similarly found that among children without known preexisting neurodevelopmental disorders, those exposed to general anesthesia before age 4 years had reduced scores in reading and numeracy (mathematics) at Grade 3 and were more likely to be considered developmentally high risk (scores in the bottom 10th percentile in two or more domains) at school entry. When restricting to only one general anesthetic and one hospitalization, they saw attenuation of association to poor development and reading scores, but poor numeracy outcome remained. In contrast to O’Leary et al., they did find an association between the number of exposures and poor developmental outcomes.50\n\nThe PANDA study is a sibling-matched cohort study that compared neurodevelopment outcomes of 105 children who were exposed to general anesthesia before the age of 36 months for inguinal hernia repairs and their unexposed siblings. Neuropsychological tests were done between the age of 8-15 years. Their data showed no statistically significant difference between IQ scores of healthy children with a single anesthetic exposure before the age of 36 months compared to their healthy unexposed siblings.51 Likewise, the MASK cohort study found no evidence for a difference in test scores between children with a single anesthetic prior to the age of 3 years compared to those with no anesthesia exposure. The study, however, did find an increased risk of deficit in processing speed and fine motor outcomes among those with multiple anesthetics. Parents of the multiple exposure group reported increased problems related to executive function, behavior, and reading.52\n\nThe General Anesthesia Compared to Spinal Anesthesia Study or “GAS study” is an international prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial investigating neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 and 5 years of age after hernia repair under 60 weeks postmenstrual age. Infants were stratified by site and gestational age at birth and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either awake-regional anesthesia or sevoflurane-based general anesthesia. Infants were excluded if they had existing risk factors for neurological injury. Results showed that exposure of just less than 1 hour to a sevoflurane general anesthesia in infancy did not increase the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age.53 The trial similarly showed evidence of equivalence in Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III) Full Scale Intelligence Quotient score measured at age 5 in this predominantly male study population.54\n\nBased on the available data we can reassure ourselves and parents that among otherwise healthy young children, a single, short general anesthetic exposure will not result in worse neurocognitive development. Nevertheless, general anesthesia is not a completely benign process. There is some evidence for a detrimental effect after repeated exposures but there is still limited data on prolonged exposure and vulnerable subgroups. Most animal studies have found that longer exposures (3 hours or longer, for non-human primates 5 hours or longer) are more likely to cause neurotoxicity. However, we do not know the equivalence of animal exposure time to that of humans.55 Furthermore, we don’t yet know which is worse: multiple short exposures or a single prolonged exposure. Even still, we do not know the age at which general anesthesia no longer poses a threat to neurocognitive development of a child. For the appropriate patients and procedures, it may be wise to offer a neuraxial anesthetic technique to limit the number of potential general anesthetic exposures. If general anesthesia is required, a combined technique of regional and general anesthesia would be helpful to decrease to amount of intravenous and inhalational agents required to maintain a good level of anesthesia for the case.\n\nConclusion\n\nPediatric anesthesia is challenging in that we work with a variety of patients with not only different medical comorbidities but also with those at different neurocognitive developmental states. We are only beginning to understand the effects of anesthetics on neuroinflammation, perioperative stress and neurodevelopment. Currently, we have evidence suggesting that a short single exposure to general anesthesia in healthy young patients does not result in adverse neurocognitive outcomes. It is difficult to elucidate whether the adverse outcomes in patients who require prolonged surgeries and multiple procedures are the result of the anesthetics, changes associated with surgical-induced stress, or a marker of phenotypes predisposed to neurotoxicity. The reality is probably multifactorial. Good pre-operative communication between the urology and anesthesia teams regarding specific patient and case needs leads to optimal, individualized patient care.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Healthy young patients with a single, short exposure to general anesthesia are not at increased risk for deficient neurocognitive development.\n  A caudal block, epidural, or truncal block provides safe and effective pain control for outpatient urologic surgeries\n  Patients who will need longer-term admission after painful procedures may benefit from a caudal or epidural catheter to provide longer term analgesia\n  Laparoscopic and robotic surgery creates changes in physiology which can usually be partially mitigated by the anesthesia team\n  Ill children should be rescheduled if procedures are elective, but may be assessed on a case-by-case basis if symptoms are minimal\n  Children at risk for postoperative apnea should be admitted for observation\n  Good pre-operative communication between the urology and anesthesia teams regarding specific patient and case needs leads to optimal, individualized patient care\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nDavis PJ, Cladis F.

        "title": "Physiology of Pediatric Laparoscopy",
        "content": "Background\n\nOver the last two decades, the use of laparoscopic and robotic surgical techniques has been widely adopted into urology and pediatric urology. Advantages of laparoscopic surgical approaches include increased magnification, better cosmesis, decreased post-operative pain scores and overall shorter hospital stays compared to open surgical approaches.1 Since the first adoption of laparoscopy in pediatric urology in 1976 by Crotesti et al for the evaluation of undescended testes, laparoscopic technique has greatly advanced the ability to perform complex surgical procedures.2\n\nThe application of robotic surgical systems within pediatric urology was the next breakthrough in advancing minimally invasive technique after laparoscopy. In smaller patients, the limitations of laparoscopy such as limited range of motion and degree of magnification were amplified. Robotic surgery offers greater magnification and visualization of smaller areas, seven degrees range of motion and reduction in hand tremors – ideal when working in small spaces. Since robotic techniques were first implemented within pediatric urology, the role of robotic surgery has expanded to include a variety of procedures including pyeloplasty, heminephrectomy, bladder neck reconstruction, ureteral reimplant, appendicovesicostomy and others.3,4,5\n\nWith the growing popularity of laparoscopic and robotic techniques within pediatric urology, understanding the physiology of pediatric laparoscopy is essential for providing safe outcomes for pediatric patients.\n\nPositioning, Access, and Port Placement\n\nThe first step to performing a safe and effective laparoscopic/robotic procedure is to gain access to the abdomen or retroperitoneum without injury (see Tips section below). Proper patient positioning can prevent instrument collision and can improve ergonomics. Important aspects of patient positioning include padding all pressure points; securing tubing, electrical cords, and other equipment; and securing the patient to the table.\n\nIn addition to providing safety, patient position can play a significant role in patient physiology. Studies have demonstrated that placing a pediatric patient in the Trendelenburg position during laparoscopic/robotic surgery will lead to tachycardia and increased vascular resistance along with decreased mean arterial pressure and overall cardiac output. These effects are reversed in the reverse Trendelenburg position.6 Cardiac and respiratory stress is also increased with flank or left lateral decubitus positioning.\n\nPrior to obtaining access, bowel and bladder distension must be considered. This concept is particularly important in children since they have unique physiologic and anatomic differences compared to adults. Children have faster gastric emptying times which results in increased small bowel and gastric distension. Therefore, it is important to decompress the stomach after intubation but prior to abdominal access for optimal visibility. Similarly, the bladder is in a more abdominal position compared to adults. Foley placement prior to gaining access can help prevent unintentional injury.\n\nThe open (Hasson) technique is the preferred method for obtaining access in children and those with previous abdominal surgeries. The Veress technique has been described previously but has been associated with an increased incidence of access related injury in the pediatric patients. In a survey of 153 pediatric urologists in 1995, overall complication rates were significantly higher for the Veress needle technique versus the Hasson technique, 7.8% and 3.9% respectively.7 The open (Hasson) technique involves making an initial incision (5–12mm depending on port size) and dissection down to level of fascia. The port is then inserted under direct vision.\n\nAfter access has been established, the next step is proper port placement. One aspect to consider is the increased abdominal wall laxity of children. Studies have demonstrated that a child’s abdomen stretches by 17% on average with induction of pneumoperitoneum. As children age, the longitudinal elasticity decreases but the transverse abdominal wall elasticity increases.8 Marking port sites incision, after insufflation can help account for this difference. Trocars also come in a variety of sizes, with or without sheaths, and can be noncutting to allow for radial dilation to help prevent bowel or vascular injury during port placement.\n\nDuring trocar placement, another rare complication is air embolism. Air embolism is thought to occur most commonly at the time of initial laparoscopic access with inadvertent injury of a patent umbilical vein. A recent study by Patterson et al revealed a lower relative risk of air embolism in children greater than one year compared to patients less than one-year old.9\n\nTips for Positioning, Port Placement, and Obtaining Access\n\n\n  Trendelenburg positioning has cardiac and cerebral physiological changes\n  Open (Hassan) port placement is a better option than Veress technique\n  Use an orogastric tube to decompress bowels prior to obtaining access\n  Place foley catheter to decompress bladder (bladder is predominantly intraperitoneal in children)\n  Mark port sites and make incision after insufflation\n  Be aware of the increased elasticity of abdominal wall and use force diligently\n  Be aware of Air Embolism in children under age one year\n\n\nPhysiology of Insufflation Agents\n\nCurrently, the most common agent for insufflation in laparoscopic and robotic procedures is carbon dioxide. Historically, several other gases were used to induce pneumoperitoneum including helium, argon, and nitrous oxide. The inert gases helium and argon posed the problem of low solubility in blood which subsequently led to higher rates of subcutaneous emphysema and venous gas embolism.10,11 Nitrous oxide gained popularity in the 1970s since it was inexpensive, readily absorbed and rapidly eliminated from the body – like carbon dioxide. However, two case reports of intraperitoneal explosions using nitrous oxide resulted in a rapid decline of its use in laparoscopic surgery.12,13 More recently, several clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of nitrous oxide.14,15\n\nCarbon dioxide came to be the most widely used insufflating gas given that it was cost-effective, soluble, rapidly excreted, and noncombustible. However, despite its advantages, carbon dioxide can significantly impact various physiological systems. Insufflation with carbon dioxide has been shown to provoke an inflammatory response created by proinflammatory cytokines.16 In addition, higher insufflation pressure has been shown to affect the integrity of the peritoneal mucosa and cellular infiltration of carbon dioxide – leading to a greater inflammatory response.17 Furthermore, carbon dioxide insufflation has been associated with peritoneal acidosis and oxidative stress.18\n\nPhysiology of Pneumoperitoneum\n\nWith laparoscopic and robotic surgery, the increased abdominal pressure from pneumoperitoneum can have a profound effect on pediatric patients involving multiple systems (Table 1).\n\nTable 1 Effect of increased abdominal pressure on various body systems during surgery and prevention.\n\n\n  \n    \n      System\n      Effect of Increased Abdominal Pressure\n      Prevention Strategies\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      CNS\n      Intrabdominal CO2 diffuses into the blood, causing hypercarbia →increased intracranial pressure and reduction in cerebral oxygenation\n      Avoid Trendelenburg positioning, place patient in supine position with head up to minimize rise in intracranial pressureMonitor cerebral perfusion intraoperatively with near-infrared spectroscopy\n    \n    \n      Respiratory\n      Increased abdominal pressure can restrict diaphragmatic mobility and compliance →atelectasis and hypercarbia\n      Anesthesiologist may employ PEEP to reduce risk of atelectasisUse endotracheal tube and increase minute ventilation to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide\n    \n    \n      Cardiac\n      Increased intraabdominal pressure → decreased cardiac preload → decreased cardiac output. To compensate, systemic vascular resistance increases\n      Trocar placement can induce vagal response and severe bradycardiaMinimize intraabdominal pressure and administer vagolytic agents\n    \n    \n      Renal\n      Renal vein compression and direct renal parenchyma compression →decreased blood flow and renal cellular injury and subsequent transient decrease in urine output and creatinine clearance\n      Aggressive volume expansion, especially for patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction\n    \n    \n      Immune\n      Ischemia-reperfusion injury can lead to local inflammation of the peritoneal wall →development of intraperitoneal adhesions\n      Minimize intraabdominal pressure if able and account for adhesions when obtaining access on patients who have undergone previous laparoscopic surgery\n    \n    \n      Hepatic\n      Increased intraabdominal pressure → decreased portal venous blood flow and dysfunction of hepatic perfusion autoregulatory system → transient transaminitis\n      Transaminitis generally resolves within 48 hours, but may be clinically significant for patients with pre-existing hepatic dysfunction\n    \n    \n      Ocular\n      Transient increase in intraocular pressure can be clinically significant for patients with glaucoma or other ocular pathologies Increased central venous pressure →conjunctival congestion (usually self-limited)\n      Avoid high intraabdominal pressure and Trendelenburg positioning if able\n    \n  \n\n\nPneumoperitoneal Pressure\n\nThe ideal pneumoperitoneal pressure for pediatric patients should result in the least physiologic effects both intraoperatively and postoperatively, while maintaining enough pneumoperitoneum to safely perform laparoscopic surgery. Several studies have investigated the ideal pneumoperitoneal pressure for laparoscopic/robotic pediatric surgery. As expected, older and larger patients can tolerate greater intraabdominal pressures. Studies have demonstrated that intraabdominal pressure levels between 8–12 mm Hg are acceptable for children older than one year.19 Sakka et al used transesophageal echocardiology to study hemodynamic changes in children aged 2–6 years and found that pressures of less than 12 mm Hg had minimal effects on cardiac index while maintaining satisfactory surgical conditions.20 Given the decreased intraabdominal cavity size, studies of pneumoperitoneal pressure on infants have demonstrated the need for decreased intraabdominal pressure. A randomized control trial by Sureka et al found that in infants less than 10 kg undergoing laparoscopic renal surgery, a pneumoperitoneal pressure of 6–8 mm Hg resulted in fewer hemodynamic and respiratory changes and earlier postoperative recovery compared to a pneumoperitoneal pressure of 9–10 mm Hg.21 Given the impact of pneumoperitoneum on the physiologic systems described below, maintaining intraabdominal pressure below 12 mm Hg for children and below 8 mm Hg for infants is imperative to preforming safe and effective laparoscopic/robotic pediatric surgery.\n\nCentral Nervous System\n\nThe central nervous system is directly impacted by the diffusion of intraabdominal carbon dioxide into the blood. The resulting hypercarbia can contribute to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). This phenomenon is particularly important when considering laparoscopy for patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Case studies have demonstrated that despite maintaining a low intra-abdominal pressure (&lt;10 mm Hg), patients experience a rapid rise in intracranial pressure of greater than 12 mm Hg above baseline and subsequently experience a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. The rise in intracranial pressure may be treated by ventricular drainage intraoperatively.22 Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that increased intraabdominal pressure is associated with a reduction in cerebral oxygenation which warrant close monitoring during laparoscopy and the immediate post-operative period.23\n\nMaintaining a low intraabdominal pressure can help prevent this reduction in cerebral oxygenation and increase in ICP. Trendelenberg positioning has also been shown to significantly increase ICP in pediatric patients. Positioning children in a supine position with head up can help prevent the negative consequences of increased ICP. Intraoperatively, anesthesia may employ near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure cerebral tissue oxygen saturation and intervene during episodes of suboptimal oxygenation and perfusion to the immature brain.24\n\nRespiratory System\n\nRespiration is also closely tied to changes in pneumoperitoneum and abdominal pressure. Increased intraabdominal pressure leads multiple effects on respiration. One of the most profound effects intraoperatively is the cephalad shift of the diaphragm which results in a decreased functional residual capacity and increased risk of atelectasis. Although atelectasis typically resolves within 24 hours after surgery, post-operative complications such as worsening of bronchitis or development of pneumonia may occur. Aside from lowering intraabdominal pressure, anesthesia may employ positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) intraoperatively to help prevent atelectasis. In a randomized controlled study of children undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, lung ultrasonography demonstrated that the use of PEEP at 5 cm H2O reduced the number of atelectatic regions by half compared to the non-PEEP group.25\n\nLung compliance, the measure of lung and chest recoil, is also affected by this cephalad shift of the diaphragm. This effect is magnified by Trendelenberg positioning. Studies have shown a 17% decrease in lung compliance upon placing patient into the Trendelenberg position. Upon insufflation, lung compliance decreased by an additional 10%. The reduced lung compliance results in inadequate pulmonary gas exchange which leads to hypercarbia.26 Although most children can tolerate the increased carbon dioxide load, children with underlying lung pathologies may be subject to developing significant acidosis and subsequent neurological damage.\n\nAnother factor that can lead to hypercarbia during laparoscopy is absorption of the carbon dioxide gas used for insufflation itself. Pediatric patients are especially susceptible to hypercarbia due to the shorter distance between the capillaries and peritoneum and the rapid absorption and high solubility of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, they have a greater absorptive area in relation to body weight compared to adults. To account for this, anesthesia may increase minute ventilation by up to 60% to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide levels at baseline.27 To control minute ventilation, endotracheal intubation is often preferred over a supraglottic airway.\n\nAnother rare complication of laparoscopic surgery is pneumothorax. A study by Bradley et al investigated the development of pneumothorax in 4 children out of a total 285 laparoscopic pediatric urologic procedures performed. Decreased oxygen saturation, subcutaneous emphysema, increased respiratory effort and asymmetric decreased lung sounds were hallmarks of pneumothorax presentation. Factors that may contribute to pneumothorax development include barotrauma, increased operative time, unrecognized congenital defects and inadvertent diaphragmatic injury during trocar placement.28 Given the quick absorption of carbon dioxide, these events of pneumothorax are often successfully managed conservatively.\n\nCardiovascular System\n\nThe effects of pneumoperitoneum on the cardiovascular system in pediatric patients have been well established. The rise in intraabdominal pressure with pneumoperitoneum causes increased pressure on the inferior vena cava which results in decreased venous return to the heart and overall decreased cardiac output. Studies have demonstrated that an insufflation pressure greater than 5–8 mm Hg results in no significant change in cardiac output, while an intraabdominal pressure of 12 mm Hg decreases cardiac output by 13%.20 To account for the decreased preload, system vascular resistance increases. In a study by Gueugniaud et al, insufflation resulted in a reduction of aortic blood flow by 67%, a decrease in stroke volume—due to decreased preload—by 68% and a compensatory increase in systemic vascular resistance by 162%.29 These effects are magnified by higher intraabdominal pressures. The higher systemic vascular resistance leads to an overall increase in mean arterial pressure with initiation of pneumoperitoneum. In a comparison of children undergoing laparoscopic herniorrhaphy versus open herniorrhaphy, mean arterial pressure was demonstrated to increase by 14.8% with pneumoperitoneum at 10 mm Hg.30\n\nAside from the effects of increased intraabdominal pressure, the insufflation agent also can significantly impact the cardiovascular system. Hypercarbia from the rapid absorption of carbon dioxide leads to several physiologic changes. With a rise in intracellular acidosis, myocardial contractility is suppressed. This is counter-balanced by the stimulation of the autonomic nervous system by carbon dioxide which leads to an elevation of heart rate, systolic blood pressure and cardiac output.31 A study of patients undergoing laparoscopic varicocelectomy demonstrated a rise in norepinephrine by over two times and epinephrine over 20 times after 10 minutes to insufflation.9\n\nAnother important consideration is that children have a higher vagal tone than adults that may occasionally be stimulated by peritoneal stimulation. This may provoke bradycardia or asystole when penetrating the peritoneum with trocars or starting insufflation. This complication is often avoided with administration of a vagolytic agent prior to insufflation.32\n\nRenal System\n\nThe primary renal effect of pneumoperitoneum is decreased urine output/oliguria and transient kidney injury. Studies of rat models have demonstrated decreased urine output at 10 mm Hg intraabdominal pressure that was associated with a 92% reduction in caval blood flow and 46% reduction in aortic blood flow.33 In addition to reduction of blood flow with pneumoperitoneum, investigators have hypothesized that the direct renal parenchymal compression can lead to decrease in GFR and oliguria during laparoscopy. Razvi et al used pressure cuffs around canine kidneys at 15 mm Hg which resulted in a decrease in urine output by 63%.34 Indirect effects of pneumoperitoneum have also been investigated in relation to renal function. The direct compression of the kidneys during pneumoperitoneum can stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system which results in salt and water retention with oliguria. Additionally, renal damage can occur with pneumoperitoneum-associated ischemia-reperfusion. As mentioned, increased intraabdominal pressure results in decreased renal blood flow. After desufflation, the renal blood flow normalizes which increases oxidative stress and subsequent tissue damage.35\n\nOne patient risk factor for post-operative kidney injury is age younger than one year. A prospective study by Gomez et al demonstrated that children less than one year of age are significantly more susceptible to more severe temporary renal injury resulting in anuria than children above one-year old, 88% versus 14%. In all cases, anuria was transient and urine output returned to baseline before discharge.36 Wingert et al investigated almost 9,000 cases of children undergoing noncardiac surgery and found several factors associated with postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) which occurred in 3.2% of cases. Patients with a higher ASA status were at significantly greater risk of developing AKI postoperatively. Post-operative AKI was also associated with significantly worse outcomes, including a 3-fold higher estimated mortality rate and 1.5 times higher readmission rate.37\n\nTo minimize the risk of developing post-operative AKI, aggressive intra-operative volume expansion has been shown to be effective.38 Furthermore, maintaining intraabdominal pressure as low as possible can minimize the direct compression-related effects on renal parenchyma.\n\nImmune System\n\nAnother effect of pneumoperitoneum is on the inflammatory system. The compromised intraabdominal perfusion with increased intraabdominal pressure can lead to ischemia-reperfusion injury with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other inflammatory cytokines. Once the peritoneum is injured, the healing process consists of repairing the damaged tissue with a fibrin plug with subsequent mesothelial regeneration. However, in the presence of inflammation, fibroblasts can proliferate and lead to the development of peritoneal adhesions which can significantly impact clinical outcomes and complications.39\n\nAlthough local ischemia-reperfusion injury from carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum can lead to an increase in inflammatory cytokines, carbon dioxide insufflation has been shown to decrease hepatic expression of acute phase reactants into systemic circulation. Investigations on rat models have shown that insufflation with carbon dioxide decreased the expression of hepatic expression of alpha-2 macroglobulin after endotoxin insult.40\n\nHepatic System\n\nThe hepatic system is also affected by increased intraabdominal pressure. In both human and animal studies, increased intraabdominal pressure of 15 mm Hg has been shown to reduce portal venous blood flow. Normally, a reduction in portal venous flow leads to reduced flow resistance through the hepatic artery—therefore maintaining blood flow to the liver. This autoregulatory system is known as the hepatic arterial buffer response. However, studies have shown that with increased intraabdominal pressure (12–15 mm Hg) control by this autoregulatory system is lost.41 In a clinical study, Jakimowicz et al reported a 53% reduction in portal blood flow with pneumoperitoneum of 14 mm Hg. Hepatic hypoperfusion can result in acute hepatocyte injury and transient elevation of liver enzymes. Transaminitis has been shown to resolve within 48 hours after surgery, however, can be clinically significant in patients with pre-existing hepatic dysfunction.42\n\nOcular System\n\nIncreased intraabdominal pressure also impacts the ocular system. Like the increase in intracranial pressure with pneumoperitoneum, intraocular pressure has also been shown to rise with an increase in intraabdominal pressure. Studies have shown that a combination of pneumoperitoneum pressure of 15 mm Hg and Trendelenburg positioning almost doubled intraocular pressure. After pneumoperitoneum evacuation and return to supine positioning, intraocular pressure returned to baseline.43 Other studies have demonstrated that during longer cases in Trendelenburg position, a 5-minute supine rest intervention can greatly reduce the intraocular pressure to safe levels. Although most children with healthy eyes can tolerate the increased intraocular pressure during pneumoperitoneum, extra care must be taken in children with congenital glaucoma who are particularly susceptible to intraocular pressure changes.\n\nAnother rare ocular occurrence post-laparoscopy is conjunctival congestion. Increased pressure in the abdominal cavity can lead to increased central venous pressure which can cause increased capillary pressure. Children have more fragile ocular capillaries in than adults, and thus the increased venous congestion can result in postoperative conjunctival congestion. This is often self-limited. However, measures that may prevent this complication include reducing intraabdominal pressure and avoiding Trendelenburg positioning if possible.44\n\nMetabolic System\n\nAs in other surgical procedures, several hormones (e.g., β-endorphin, cortisol, prolactin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine) have been noted to increase during laparoscopic surgery as a response to tissue manipulation, intraoperative trauma, and postoperative pain.45,46,47 The clinical significance of increased serum arginine vasopressin levels seen in open surgery and in response to intraperitoneal insufflation during laparoscopy remains unexplained.48,49,50\n\nBlood glucose concentration, used as a marker of stress associated with the procedures, was found not to be significantly different between laparoscopic or open procedures.51 In contrast, Devitt et. al. studies found significantly increased blood glucose levels at 2, 4, and 6 hours postoperatively in the open surgery group but not the laparoscopic-assisted group. It is possible that more frequent glucose monitoring may have elicited some differences in glucose levels.\n\nAs described by Devitt, blood cortisol was significantly higher in open procedures at 1 and 2 hours postoperatively, but returned to normal by 6 hours postoperatively, but not increased in those operated via laparoscopic-assisted.52\n\nSeveral adverse metabolic changes observed during open cholecystectomy are less pronounced with laparoscopic cholecystectomy:1 reduced postoperative plasma glucose elevation,2 less decrease in insulin sensitivity, and3 reduced hepatic stress response.53,54,55 In addition, conventional open surgery results in several other, potentially adverse, reactions: muscle proteolysis, increased intestinal mucosal protein synthesis, and increased hepatic protein synthesis.\n\nThe conversion of amino acids to urea by the liver is much higher after open incisional cholecystectomy than it is after laparoscopic cholecystectomy; hence, the catabolic reaction of the body is decreased with a laparoscopic versus an open, incisional approach.56 Indeed, in the laparoscopic patient, the reduced postoperative hepatic catabolic stress associated with reduced tissue loss of amino nitrogen may, in some way, be responsible for the more rapid convalescence that is the hallmark of laparoscopy in general.\n\nRole of Anesthesia\n\nMany of the physiologic effects of increased abdominal pressure from pneumoperitoneum can be controlled by the anesthesia team. Intraoperatively, anesthesiologists can closely monitor critical values such as intracranial pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood pressure, among many others. As described previously, alterations to ventilation settings and intravascular volume are critical during laparoscopic surgery, especially in the pediatric population. Hence why close communication between surgeons and anesthesiologists is so critical to overall patient outcomes.\n\nConclusions\n\nAs laparoscopic and robotic technology continues to evolve, the impact of laparoscopic surgery on pediatric patients’ physiology will continue to change. Pediatric surgeons must be conscious of the physiologic effects of laparoscopy to safely perform procedures and be able to adjust intraoperatively to avoid complications. Careful consideration of all steps during laparoscopy – including patient positioning, pneumoperitoneum pressure, trocar placement and volume status can be crucial for minimizing the physiologic effects of pneumoperitoneum. Therefore, as a specialty, pediatric urology must continue to consider the physiologic impact of laparoscopy on their patients and work as a multidisciplinary team to provide safe and effective care.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Be aware of unique features of pediatric anatomy when gaining access: increased abdominal elasticity, more intraperitoneal bladder, increased small bowel and gastric distension.\n  To minimize the physiologic effects of pneumoperitoneum, avoid Trendelenburg positioning if possible and maintain the lowest intraabdominal pressure possible (6-8 mmHg for children &lt;1 year, 8-12 mmHg for children &gt;1 year).\n  Anesthesia can monitor for effects of increased intraabdominal intraoperatively with near-infrared spectroscopy for cerebral perfusion, end-tidal CO2, heart rate and blood pressure.\n  Strategies to minimize impact of pneumoperitoneum include: using PEEP to prevent atelectasis, increasing minute ventilation to prevent hypercarbia, administering vagolytic agents to prevent vagal response and volume expansion to prevent renal injury\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAndolfi C, Kumar R, Boysen WR, Gundeti MS.

        "content": "Short History of Laparoscopic and Robotic Applications in Pediatric Urology\n\nLaparoscopy and robotic-assisted laparoscopy are parts of minimally invasive surgery which have been more and more popular in the world. The history of laparoscopy dates to 1805, when Bozzini developed the first cystoscope. The term of laparoscopy (“laparothorakoskopie”) was created by Swedish surgeon Hans Christian Jacobaeus in 1901. He reported 17 laparoscopy cases and 2 thoracoscopies in the same year.1 Early laparoscopy had many limitations and raised more concerns for the significant increase in complication rates.\n\nVideo technique was developing in 1960s which helps surgeons to watch the operative field on a monitor. The first case of laparoscopic technique in pediatric urology was for non-palpable undescended testes, which was reported in 1976.2 During 1970s and 1980s, laparoscopy was only widespread acceptance for diagnostic purposes among pediatric urologists. The next phase of operative laparoscopic surgery was in 1990s when more complex laparoscopic procedures began to emerge following the adult surgery practice. In 1993, Kavoussi described the first laparoscopic pyeloplasty in 24 year old female. Two years later, Craig Peters reported the first dismembered laparoscopic pyeloplasty for a right ureteropelvic junction obstruction in a boy.3 Laparoscopic pyeloplasty has significantly decreased length of stay and improved postoperative pain control. Since then, several companies like Karl Storz Endocsopy, Richard Wolf started work with pediatric urologists to develop, and improve laparoscopic instruments.\n\nOver the past several decades, laparoscopic surgery has become an important part of pediatric urological practice. In some cases, it has replaced conventional open surgery and in several cases is recognized as the gold standard approach. Laparoscopic surgery has comparable results, while also decreasing the surgical incisions to 3-mm and 5-mm port sites. For the scarless goal, even natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-site laparoscopic surgery are possible and practiced in some centers.4\n\nIn 2000, FDA approved a robotic surgical system named da Vinci Surgical System developed by Intuitive Surgical. It is designed to facilitate laparoscopic surgery and controlled by a surgeon from a console in the operating room. It has advantages of a stable, magnified 3D view, tremor filtering and motion scaling for precise intracorporeal exposure and suturing. In the past two decades, robotic-assisted surgery has been commonly used in urology, gynecology, general surgery and pediatric surgery. Da Vinci surgical system has progressed from the first generation S model to the Si and most recently, the Xi and the single-port SP system.\n\n\nFigure 1 The evolution of da Vinci Surgical System\n\n\nFigure 2 da Vinci Xi Surgical System\n\nIn 2001, Meininger reported the first case of robotic-assisted Nissen fundoplicaion in a pediatric patient.5 This work inspired the advancement of pediatric surgery. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty (RALP) was the first surgery performed with da Vinci platform in pediatric urological field reported by Olsen and Jorgensen in 2004.6 In 2005, Atug described their experience about RALP for seven pediatric patients range from 6 to 15 years.7 In 2006, Lee compared the results of RALP and open pyeloplasty (OP) by matching their age and sex with 33 patients.8 They found that mean operative time was 219 minutes in RALP group while only 181 minutes in open procedure group. Operative time of RALP decreased significantly after 15 cases. RALP cohort demonstrated a shorter length of stay, lower pain medication requirement, and the success rate was 93.9%.9 Given the high success rate and low complication of RALP, some urologists have expanded this approach on infants. Recently, Andolfi released their RALP infant case series and demonstrated that RALP is an appealing management option for UPJO in infants as it has successful outcomes, benefits of decrease length of hospital stay and improved cosmesis.10 Higganbotham team even performed the robotic-assisted laparoscopic orchiopexy for a bilateral undescended testes boy.11\n\nNowadays, laparoscopic orchiopexy, laparoscopic high-ligation with the processus vaginalis have been routine treatment around the world. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery have also been widespread in the US, European and Asia. Many other companies have tried to develop surgical robot systems to challenge the dominance of da Vinci Surgical Systems. These include Senhance surgical system from TransEnterix, Single Port Orifce Robotic Technology (SPORT) from Titan Medical, Hinotori Surgical Robot System from Medicaroid, REVO‑I Robotic Surgical System from Meere Company, Edge surgical system from Edge Medical Robotics and so on. Tens of robotic surgical system are still in the process of developing.12 The demand for robotic-assisted surgery is still increasing. New technologies could enhance the minimally-invasive efforts and improve the capabilities of previously established systems. Future studies are needed to further evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each robotic surgical device and platform in the operating suite.13\n\n\nFigure 3 Senhance Surgical System\n\n\nFigure 4 REVO-I Robot System\n\n\nFigure 5 Hinotori Robot System\n\nInstruments of Laparoscopic and Robotic Applications\n\nInstrumentation of Pediatric Urological Laparoscopic Surgery\n\nPneumoperitoneum Equipment\n\nPneumoperitoneum equipment consists of pneumoperitoneum machine, CO2 cylinder, gas output pipeline and puncture instruments. The pneumoperitoneum machine can regulate the pneumoperitoneum pressure (6–10 mm Hg) and gas flow. The current pneumoperitoneum machine can automatically adjust the intra-abdominal pressure, quickly inject gas, and monitor the CO2 consumption, and is equipped with alarm devices for insufficient CO2 pressure in the cylinder or intra-abdominal pressure exceeding the preset range, so that the surgeon can timely detect any issues, which improves the safety of the operation. Modern pneumoperitoneum machines (Figure 6) can achieve: ① Automatic circulation to filter out smoke to ensure a clear surgical field of view; ② Real-time monitoring of pneumoperitoneum pressure to ensure constant pneumoperitoneum pressure; ③ Some pneumoperitoneum inflatable equipment has a gas heating system to avoid the decline in patient body temperature. ④ Eliminate smoke emissions into the operating room, to ensure the health of surgeons and nurses.\n\n\nFigure 6 Modern pneumoperitoneum machine\n\nPower Cart\n\nPower cart (Figure 7) unifies the monitor, pneumoperitoneum machine, camera system, light source system, and electric knife into one trolley, which is convenient to push, easy for the operator to change the position at any time.\n\n\nFigure 7 Power Cart\n\nOptical System\n\nCurrently, laparoscopes mostly use columnar mirrors with good light conduction, undistorted images, flat images, ultra-wide angles, uniform brightness, long depth of field, and strong stereoscopic sensation. The diameter is 5–10 mm, the working length is 31 cm, and the field of view is 0˚, 30˚ and 45˚ (Figure 8). The 30˚ laparoscope with a diameter of 5 mm is most common used laparoscope in pediatric urology, which has the advantages of changing the surgical field of view, reducing blind areas, allowing observation of the same structure from different angles, facilitating the formation of a three-dimensional impression by the surgeon, and reducing mutual interference between the laparoscope and instruments.\n\n\nFigure 8 The 0°, 30° and 45° laparoscope.\n\nCold light source and optical fiber probe\n\nA cool or cold light source (Figure 7) providers equal proportions of red, blue, and green wavelength light to create white light and is the most common type of light used in laparoscopic surgery. Many devices currently use a xenon lamp (300 W) or xenon lamp with LED technology coupled with automatic adjustment of brightness to provide a reliable source of light source during surgery. The average lamp life is up up to 3,000 hours. This type of light source is economical, durable, and efficient. The optical fiber probe in the lens (Figure 8) is composed of a bendable bundle of light-guide fibers with high quality light transmission. These can break with deflection or bending of the lens and require repair or replacement.\n\nCamera System\n\nThe laparoscopic camera system (Figure 9) has evolved from standard definition to high definition to ultra-high definition, and most recently 4K camera systems. With resolution improving, it can bring clearer surgical views to the operator. 3D laparoscope technology is available currently, but is only available in 10 mm diameter, so it is less common in pediatric urology.\n\n\nFigure 9 Laparoscopic camera system\n\nElectrosurgical System\n\nIncluded Electrodebrider and electrocoagulation system, ultrasonic knife (Harmonic scalpel), energy platform and Ligasure. These devices provide various energy types including monopolar electrocautery, bipolar electrocautery, ultrasonic energy, and combinations to aid surgeons (Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, and Figure 13).\n\n\nFigure 10 Electrical surgery unit\n\n\nFigure 11 Ultrasonic knife\n\n\nFigure 12 Energy platform\n\n\nFigure 13 Ligasure\n\nOther Instruments\n\nCommonly used instruments consist of Veress needle, trocar, Hem-o-Lok clip appliers, titanium clip appliers, graspers, needle drivers, scissors, and more (Figure 14, Figure 15, Figure 16).\n\n\nFigure 14 Common instruments\n\n\nFigure 15 Trocar\n\n\nFigure 16 Veress needle\n\n\nFigure 17 Hem-o-lok clip applier\n\nInstrumentation of Da Vinci Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery\n\nThe da Vinci surgical system is mainly composed of three parts: surgeon console, bedside robotic arm system (Patient Cart) and 3D imaging system (Vision Cart) as shown in Figure 18.\n\n\nFigure 18 Three components that make up the da Vinci system\n\nSurgery Console: This console can be placed outside the door of the sterile room of the operating room. It mainly relies on the hands and foot pedals of the surgeon to control the operating arm and the 3D high-definition endoscope.\n\nBedside robotic arm system (Patient Cart): This system is the operating part of the robot, which mainly provides support for the instrument arm and camera arm. It usually includes 2 to 3 operating arms, each of which is equipped with needle holders, scissors, graspers, etc. The positions can be interchanged according to intraoperative needs, and the number of mechanical arms can be increased or decreased.\n\n3D imaging system (Vision Cart): The system has a built-in core processor and image processing equipment, which can be inserted into auxiliary surgical equipment (insufficiency system), and provides a three-dimensional image of the three-dimensional surgical field of vision with dual-channel signals to make the intraoperative vision more close to the visual effect of the naked eye. The vision car includes a pair of video camera controllers, a pair of light sources and left and right eye video signal synchronizers. The endoscopic camera contains dual lenses, and the images collected through the dual lenses form a 3D image under the action of the video signal synchronizer, which is helpful for the surgeon to identify the tissue relationship.\n\nCommonly used equipment for children of da Vinci robot includes the following. Robotic trocar, consoles, patient tower. In addition to the 8 mm (Xi), 8.5 mm (Si) diameter working channel used by the endoscopic camera channel, the other operating channels use its 8 mm or 5 mm (Si) working channels. The special da Vinci robot system cannula is marked with a \"two thin and one thick\" marking line at the end of the abdominal cavity. The depth of insertion into the abdominal wall is shallower than that of a traditional laparoscope.\n\nOne-time-use sterile robotic arm set with an adapter. It is the \"bridge\" between the robotic arm and the surgical instrument.\n\nSurgical instruments: Each surgical instrument is composed of three parts: disc, shaft, and wrist joint. Commonly used robotic surgical instruments in pediatric urology are divided into 8 mm surgical instruments and 5mm surgical instruments, including unipolar curved scissors, non-invasive forceps, large needle holder, perforated bipolar forceps, electrode electrosurgical knife, surgical curved scissors, needle holder, and harmonic scalpel (Xi). The EndoWrist articulation of instruments allows for precise control with ±90 degrees of articulation in the wrist, motion scaling, and hand tremor elimination. There are four degrees of freedom with standard laparoscopic instruments on two axes (moving inward, outward, clockwise, and counterclockwise).\n\nPatient Positioning, Trocar Placement and Initial Access\n\nUpper Urinary Tract Surgery\n\nFor laparoscopic upper urinary tract surgery, we usually select healthy side in the reclined supine position, with the affected side padded at 45˚ to 60˚, as close as possible to the edge of the bed at about 1 cm.\n\n\nFigure 19 Laparoscopic upper urinary tract patient position\n\n\nFigure 20 Laparoscopic upper urinary tract trocar position\n\nFor robotic-assisted laparoscopic upper urinary tract surgery patient position selection, we have four rules: firstly, the patient is positioned as kidney position to provide operation space and avoid the interference with robot arms. Secondly the patient is placed close to the edge of the table to decrease the distant with assistant. With the use of table rotation, we preferred 80˚ lateral decubitus position. Lastly, the temperature management in operation room is very important. Warm air machine and warm blankets should be used for infant surgery.\n\nAll ports were placed under direct vision included one 8.5 mm camera trocar, one 8-mm trocar and one 5-mm trocar. One or two additional assistant 3-mm trocars were placed at the lateral 3 cm of the midpoint of the Pfannenstiel line, to improve the efficient of the suture\n\n\nFigure 21 Patient and trocar position for robotic-assisted laparoscopic upper urinary tract surgery\n\nLower Urinary Tract Surgery\n\n\nFigure 22 Modified lithotomy position for lower urinary tract surgery\n\nFor lower urinary tract surgery, both laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, we employ modified lithotomy position with head down 30–45˚. Laparoscopic or robotic ports are placed including one camera trocar through umbilicus, and two additional trocars placed at umbilical level with 4–6 cm distance between them.\n\n\nFigure 23 Trocar position for lower urinary tract surgery\n\nApplications of Laparoscopic and Robotic Technique\n\nPyeloplasty\n\nWell-established evidence has demonstrated that laparoscopic pyeloplasty or RALP not only has success rates equal to those of open pyeloplasty, but also has the advantages of minimal invasiveness, better cosmesis, less post-operative pain, decreased length of hospital stay, and early recovery. Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty is gold standard for every approach.\n\nLaparoscopic Pyeloplasty\n\nFor laparoscopic pyeloplasty, transperitoneal or retroperitoneal could both achieve satisfied surgical view. But for robotic-assisted surgery, the space of retroperitoneal is too small. So that we introduce both transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approach for laparoscopic pyeloplasty and transperitoneal approach for RALP.\n\n\nFigure 24 Retroperitoneal anatomical markers\n\n\nFigure 25 The stenosis part of UPJ from retroperitoneal view\n\nRetroperitoneal Approach\n\n\n  Longitudinal incise the skin 1.5–2.0 cm below the tip of the 12th rib in the posterior axillary line. The tendon membrane at the beginning of the transversus abdominis muscle and the lumbodorsal fascia are bluntly separated by vascular forceps to reach the perirenal area. A balloon is placed after blunt separation of the perirenal space by the index finger to create the retroperitoneal operating space, and the pneumoperitoneum pressure is maintained at 8–14 mmHg, with an average of 10 mm Hg.\n  The perinephric fascia was cut longitudinally by ultrasonic knife to expose the dorsal aspect of the lower pole of the kidney, and the renal pelvis and upper ureter were separated to reveal the site and cause of stenosis. Separate the dorsal middle and lower pole of the kidney, free and fully expose the renal pelvis and upper ureter, clarify the UPJO.\n  Cut the renal pelvis. Keep the medial part of the pelvis incompletely detached and still connected to the ureter, and split the ureter longitudinally until crossing the stenosis by 1.0 to 2.0 cm.\n  Suture renal pelvis flap with the lowest point of the ureter together with 5-0 absorbable suture.\n  Separation of the ureter at approximately 0.5 cm proximal to the stenotic segment and further completion of the renal pelvis cut to remove the UPJ stenotic segment and part of the dilated renal pelvis.\n  Sequential suturing of the posterior wall of the anastomosis with 1 locking edge every 2 stitches\n  Continued suturing of the excess renal pelvic flap opening without cutting the sutures\n  Placement of a double J stent in line through the anastomosis.\n  Intermittent suturing of the anterior wall of the anastomosis.\n  In the presence of ectopic vascular compression, the vessel is placed dorsal to the renal pelvic ureter for plication, the pneumoperitoneal pressure is reduced, and it is confirmed that there is no active bleeding in the operative field, and one retroperitoneal drain is left in place via a trocar needle on the iliac crest to close the incision.\n\n\n\nFigure 26 Keep the medial part of the pelvis incompletely detached and still connected to the ureter\n\n\nFigure 27 Suture the lowest point of ureter\n\n\nFigure 28 Placement of a double-J stent\n\nTransperitoneal Approach\n\n\n  After establishing a normal Trocar access, the pneumoperitoneal pressure is maintained at 8–14 mmHg, with a mean of 10 mmHg.\n  Open the lateral peritoneum along the lateral side of the paracolic sulcus to fully free the colon, push the colon medially to identify the gonadal vein and ureter. For left-sided pyeloplasty, open the avascular area along the mesenteric space, and after freeing the perirenal fat, reveal the renal pelvis and upper ureter.\n  The renal pelvis is fully freed from the hilar vessels using downward retraction and blunt separation. Then freed the pelvis dorsally to expand the renal pelvis and observed for the presence of vagal vessels crossing the ureteropelvic junction to clarify the site of stenosis.\n  The superior horn of the renal pelvis is suspended from the abdominal wall with 2-0 mousse wire. Then cut the renal pelvis from posterior to inferior to superior to form a funnel shape. Then cut the ureter longitudinally to cross the stenosis by 1 to 2 cm.\n  Suture the renal pelvis flap with the lowest point of ureter with 5-0 absorbable thread.\n  Separating the ureter at approximately 0.5 cm distal to the stenotic segment and further completing the renal pelvis cut to remove the UPJ stenotic segment and partially dilated renal pelvis\n  Sequential suturing of the posterior wall of the anastomosis with 1 locking margin every 2 stitches.\n  Continue suturing the excess renal pelvis flap opening without cutting the sutures.\n  Placement of a double-J stent.\n  Continuous suturing of the anterior wall of the anastomosis, careful and thorough hemostasis, and warm saline irrigation of the operative field.\n  Interrupted suturing of the lateral peritoneum or mesenteric gap.\n\n\n\nFigure 29 The transmesenteric approach\n\n\nFigure 30 The superior horn of the renal pelvis is suspended\n\nRobotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Pyeloplasty\n\n\n  For left side cases, the transmesenteric approach was adopted while the dilated renal pelvis was located at the inside of the descending colon. For right side cases, we selected the paracolic sulci approach.\n  Then we carefully dissected the proximal ureter and renal pelvis while preserving the ureteral blood supply.\n  The pelvis was cut above the obstruction tissue and trimmed by a percutaneous hitch stich to stabilize it and facilitated the anastomosis.\n  After spatulated the distal ureter after excision of the obstruction segment, we sutured the lowest point of the aperistaltic ureteral segment and the pelvis end with a running 6-0 PDS-II.\n  Then the posterior wall of the ureter was closed through continuous suture. Before the anterior anastomoses were started with a second running 6-0 PDS II suture, a double-J ureteral stent (COOK, USI-512, Ireland) was placed antegrade.\n  At last, we closed the mesentery or peritoneum with a 5-0 absorbing suture.\n\n\n\nFigure 31 The procedure of RALP\n\nUreteral Reimplantation\n\nUreteral reimplantation is the gold treatment of vesicoureteral reflux and ureteral stricture. Traditionally, this procedure has been done using an open access. Many different techniques can be used: intravesical Cohen reimplantaion, transvesical Polino-Leadbetter reimplantaion, extravesical Lich-Gregoir reimplantion. All technique could be done through laparoscopic, pneumovesical laparoscopic or robotic approach. Here we introduce pneumovesical laparoscopic Cohen’s Reimplantation Procedure (transverse submucosal bladder tunnel uretero-vesical anastomosis) and extravesical Lich-Gregoir reimplantation.\n\nPneumovesical Establishment\n\n\n  The cystoscope was placed through the urethra. Then CO2 gas was injected through the cystoscope until the bladder was dilated to the umbilical level. Full bladder traction was done percutaneously under cystoscopic observation.Fixed the top of the filled bladder at the subumbilical position in the midline of the abdomen, the skin was cut at the lower edge of the traction line. Trocar was punctured immediately after the traction fixed. A 3-5 mm operating Trocar was placed on the left and right sides, respectively. Then the cystoscope was withdrawn. CO2 gas was injected via the ophthalmoscopic Trocar.\n  Locating the bilateral ureteral orifices.\n  One stitch of traction is sutured at the ureteral opening on the affected side. Cut the mucosa along the ureteral orifice with an electric hook loop. Free the ureter from the inner segment of the bladder wall by the electric knife or ultrasonic knife closely. The free ureter is dragged into the bladder for about 5.0 cm to the dilated segment of the ureter that can be drawn tension-free to the top of the contralateral ureteral orifice. In male patient, we must protect the vas deferens when freeing the ureter.\n  Cut a small opening at the junction of the distal dilated segment of the ureter and the stenotic segment to drain the fluid. For the ureteral diameter greater than 12 mm, folding or cutting of the dilated ureter should be performed.\n  Cut the mucosal layer at about 2.0 cm above the orifice of the contralateral ureter. Then separate the submucosal layer with scissors or vascular forceps and make a submucosal tunnel to the ureteral orifice.\n  Drag the ureter to the opposite side via the submucosal tunnel, excise the stenotic lesion tissue at the ureteral opening, and fix the whole ureter to the bladder mucosa with 5-0 or 6-0 Vicryl sutures for 6-8 stitches and 2 stitches with the bladder muscle layer.\n  Close the original ureteral orifice bladder muscle layer with the ureteral muscle layer with 5-0 Vicryl suture\n  Leave a double-J stent through Trocar.\n  Remove each Trocar, suture the subcutaneous and skin.\n\n\n\nFigure 32 Free the ureter\n\n\nFigure 33 Make a submucosal tunnel to the ureteral orifice.\n\n\nFigure 34 Close the original ureteral orifice\n\n\nFigure 35 Leave a double-J stent\n\nRobotic-Assisted Lich-Gregoir Reimplantation\n\n\n  Open the lateral peritoneum at the pulsating external iliac artery, find the ureter that crosses the external iliac artery, and free the ureter as far as possible to the uretero-vesical junction to fully reveal the ureteral stenosis.\n  Fill the bladder with 60 ml of saline to keep the bladder lightly filled. A 5 cm incision was made in the lateral posterior wall of the bladder. Then incise the bladder to the submucosa of the bladder.\n  Detach the ureter at the ureterovesical junction, trim the distal ureter to normal size. Enlarge the bladder mucosal fissure at this junction. Then suture the trimmed ureter to the bladder mucosal fissure with 6/0 absorbable thread to fix it. Complete the posterior wall anastomosis and leave the double-J stent in place to continue to complete the anterior wall of the anastomosis (For the reflux cases, insert the double-J stent before surgery).\n  Absorbable sutures were used to close the peritoneum at the lateral wall of the bladder and the peritoneum around the ureter in the pelvic segment. The robotic system was removed, drainage tube was placed, and the skin incision was sutured.\n\n\n\nFigure 36 Free the ureter\n\n\nFigure 37 Incise the bladder to the submucosa of the bladder\n\n\nFigure 38 Suture both sides of the pulpy muscle layer to form a submucosal tunnel\n\nBladder Rhabdomyosarcoma\n\nRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. Radical or partial cystectomy should be performed to remove tumor. Here we introduce our experience of robotic-assisted radical cystectomy with sigmoid orthotopic neobladder reconstruction with bilateral ureteral reimplantation (Politano-Leadbetter technique).\n\n\n  A 10-mm port was placed at about 6 cm to the symphysis pubis for the camera. Two 8-mm robotic ports for the #1and #2 robotic arm were placed 6 cm to the camera port at the midclavicular line above the anterior superior spine. Two 5-mm assistant ports were placed at the right midclavicular line near under the costal margin.\n  After the careful and accurate radical resection of the tumor bladder\n  \n    and peripheral pelvis lymph nodes, we captured about 20 cm sigmoid colon and detubularized it into a spheric shape to reconstruct the neobladder that can eventually\n  \n  accommodate about 100 mL.\n  Then we conducted the antireflux reimplantation (Politano-Leadbetter technique) with bilateral ureter through the submucosal tunnel\n  At last, we took the specimen through the groin incision (bikini line).\n\n\n\nFigure 39 The procedure of radical cystectomy with sigmoid orthotopic neobladder reconstruction with bilateral ureteral reimplantation\n\nOther Applications\n\nWe have also performed robotic-assisted laparoscopic for nephrectomy or nephron sparing surgery for Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma resection prostatic capsulotomy and vas deferens reconstruction. For the complex hydronephrosis cases, Yang-Monti technique, appendiceal or oral mucosa ureter replacement are conducted. With the improving of instrument and technology, the future of minimally invasive surgery is hopeful.\n\nConsiderations\n\nFor reimplantation, free the ureter of sufficient length to adequately remove the ureteral lesion and ensure a tension-free anastomosis as much as possible. Due to the lack of force feedback in robotic-assisted system, excessive clamping of ureteral tissues should be avoided, and the surrounding ureteral tissues and blood supply should be preserved. We should pay attention to maintaining symmetrical sutures when performing ureteral bladder reimplantation to prevent ureteral torsion or angulation.\n\nIf the diameter of the ureter exceeds 1.5 cm in the voided state, it should be cut, otherwise it is difficult to establish an anti-reflux structure. The length of the submucosal tunnel of the bladder should be about 5 times the diameter of the ureter to maintain a relatively fixed forceps as support to obtain a satisfactory anti-reflux effect.\n\nFor pyeloplasty, the renal pelvis should be freed more fully, which can reduce the tension of the anastomosis, and the upper ureter should be freed as little as possible to minimize the direct clamping of the ureter by robotic system instruments and protect the ureteral blood supply. The first suture is most important. If the pelvic ureter is completely separated and then anastomosed, distortion of the ureter is likely to occur. Therefore, the direction of the renal axis should be accurately judged intraoperatively. and the lower pelvic flap. The lowest point of the renal pelvis should be anastomosed with the lateral wall of the longitudinally split ureter.\n\nReferences\n\n\nWE. KJ.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe advent of endoscopic instrumentation has revolutionized the field of urology, improving both diagnostic and therapeutic potential for urologic disorders. Over the past several decades, technologic advancements have allowed miniaturization of adult urologic instruments for use in the pediatric genitourinary tract. Cystourethroscopy, ureteroscopy and nephroscopy are indispensable instruments for the pediatric urologist to diagnose and treat conditions from vesicoureteral reflux, nephrolithiasis and posterior urethral valves to congenital anomalies and genitourinary trauma. Previously open surgical procedures have been transformed into endoscopic procedures that are less invasive and allow faster recovery of our patients.\n\nIn this chapter, we will discuss the role of lower and upper tract endoscopy in the pediatric patient and provide a guide for evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions requiring pediatric endoscopy.\n\nHistory of Endourology\n\nPrior to the arrival of endoscopic instruments, surgical procedures involving bodily orifices were limited to use of specula, probes, and knives.1 The first endoscopic prototype was introduced by Phillip Bozzini in 1806. The ‘lichtleiter’ or ‘light conducter’ consisted of a long funnel placed in a sharkskin covered box and a candle for illumination. Angled mirrors inside the box directed the light into the human body. It was used to examine the vagina, bladder, and nasopharynx, but was never used inside a patient.1,2,3,4 In 1853, Antoine Desormeaux introduced the first working cystoscope and is credited as the ‘father of cystoscopy’.2,3,4 Technologic advances included a smaller endoscope, a kerosene lamp, and a concave mirror with a central hole that improved device illumination.2 He is the first known to use his primitive cystoscope on a patient for excision of a urethral papilloma.4 Major complications included thermal burns associated with the kerosene light source and insufficient illumination.5 In 1877, German urologist Maximilian Nitze utilized a miniaturized telescope with a series of lenses along a hollow tube to magnify the image and a water-cooled electric platinum filament at the end for illumination.6 When Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb in 1878, Nitze’s device was modified by adding a lightbulb to the tip of the cystoscope.2,7 The Amici prism, developed in 1906, allowed images offset by 90˚ to appear in the correct orientation, and this technology was incorporated into cystoscope design thereafter.7\n\nThe discovery that glass was a better conductor of light than air paved the way for fiberoptic designs. Harold Hopkins invented the rod lens system in 1951 by bundling and arranging glass fibers 0.1mm in diameter coaxially with the eyepiece to transmit images.7 The ‘fiberoscope’ coupled with an external light source improved light transmission &gt; 80 times, and the system was patented in 1959.7 This technology laid the groundwork for the modern rigid cystoscope.\n\nIn addition to endoscopic advances, camera systems have also improved over time. With miniaturization of the camera equipment and invention of a charge-coupling device, optical images obtained from the endoscope are converted into photons and digital images.3,8 Digital images can now be displayed on external monitors, an innovation transformative for urologic surgical education.\n\nCystourethroscopy\n\nIndications\n\nCystoscopy serves an important role for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric genitourinary tract pathology. In addition, anatomic information obtained from cystourethroscopy facilitates planning of genitourinary reconstruction. Common indications include evaluation of congenital genitourinary anomalies (bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex, cloacal anomalies, posterior urethral valves, ectopic ureters), vaginal anatomy, and urinary channels, endoscopic injection for vesicoureteral reflux and treatment of bladder stones.9 Virtually all procedures are performed under general anesthesia in the operating room.

Instrument size is denoted in the unit French (Fr), with a 1 Fr diameter equivalent to 1/3 mm.10 Rigid cystoscope components include an optical lens, bridge, sheath and obturator. Lenses are manufactured with tip angles ranging from 0–120˚. In our practice, 0˚ and 30˚ lenses are most common. The bridge connects the lens to the sheath and provides 1–2 working channels. Sheath sizes range from 5 Fr to adult sizes and have associated irrigation ports. The obturator can be used in place of the lens inside the sheath to blunt the tip of the sheath for blind passage through the urethra into the bladder. Rigid cystoscopy also requires a light source, endoscopic camera, external monitor and irrigation fluid. Flexible cystoscopes incorporate the endoscope, light source, and camera together and have a single working channel for irrigation and instrument passage. Flexible cystoscope tips can deflect up to 210˚, facilitating device maneuverability, and are available in a variety of sizes.\n\nIn our practice, rigid cystoscopes are used in most cases and flexible cystoscopes are reserved for cases when positioning into lithotomy is difficult or for navigation of tortuous catheterizable channels.\n\nPreoperative Considerations\n\nUrinalysis should be performed prior to urinary tract instrumentation and urine culture if applicable.11 Preoperative urine culture and antibiotic treatment, if indicated, is especially important in patients whose urinary tract is likely colonized such as patients on intermittent catheterization or with indwelling catheters. If a urinary tract infection is present, the patient should be treated with culture specific antibiotics and the procedure postponed due to the risk of bacteremia and sepsis.\n\nThe AUA Best Practice Statement on Urologic Procedures and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in 2019 recommends against preprocedural antibiotics for routine diagnostic cystoscopy in the absence of specific patient risk factors, such as immunocompromise, chronic GU tract colonization, anatomic anomalies predisposing to urinary stasis and poor nutritional status.12 No clear guidance exists specifically for pediatric endourologic instrumentation, but we use these guidelines to direct procedural antibiotic prophylaxis. Detailed surgical history including review of operative reports is essential prior to endoscopy, especially in the setting of previous genitourinary reconstruction.\n\nSurgical Considerations\n\nPrior to induction of anesthesia, endoscopic instruments should be inspected for completeness, compatibility, and function. This is especially important in pediatric endoscopy where various sizes of instruments and accessories are used. Following induction of general anesthesia and preprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis (when indicated), the patient is positioned into dorsal lithotomy (Figure 1). In infants, small rolled towels or gel rolls can be placed under the knees and legs secured in place with tape. Larger children are positioned using stirrups. Genitalia and perineum are prepped with betadine containing antiseptic solution as alcohol and chlorhexidine-based preparations can damage mucus membranes. External anatomy is examined. Mild meatal stenosis can be treated with sequential dilation with McCrae sounds, whereas severe meatal stenosis may require formal meatotomy. Next, a lubricated cystoscope is passed into the urethra and irrigation is turned on. In male patients, the penis is placed on stretch and directed superiorly. This position is optimal for urethroscopy of the anterior urethra, then the surgeon’s hand is dropped inferiorly to allow passage into the posterior urethra and bladder. Systematic evaluation of the bladder is performed, any ancillary interventions performed, and the urethra is visualized with active inflow of irrigation during regress of the cystoscope. Note, inspection of the augmented bladder may be difficult due to mucosal folds and mucus production. Irrigation of mucus out of the bladder and judicious use of irrigation can improve visualization. Overdistension of the augmented bladder should be avoided as this can lead to bladder perforation. The flexible cystoscope is passed per urethra in a similar fashion to a urethral catheter and the tip is deflected as needed for visualization and inspection upon entry into the bladder.\n\n\nFigure 1 Modified Dorsal Lithotomy. Careful positioning into modified dorsal lithotomy in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta for ureteroscopic stone extraction.\n\nCystoscopy can also be performed through a suprapubic tube tract, vesicostomy or catheterizable channel with similar technique. It is important to note surgical details (e.g. type of enteric segment used, channel trajectory, continence mechanism) prior to endoscopy. Catheterizable channels are delicate, and the scope should not be advanced until the lumen is visualized to avoid channel damage or perforation.\n\n\nFigure 2 Cystoscopy with Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor.

Ultrasonic lithotripsy of large bladder stone in an augmented bladder, demonstrating the applicability and versatility of endoscopy.\n\nComplications\n\nComplications following diagnostic cystourethroscopy are rare and include asymptomatic bacteriuria (5–8%), symptomatic urinary tract infection (2–5%) and gross hematuria.13\n\nPostoperative Care and Follow Up\n\nCystourethroscopy is typically an outpatient surgical procedure and causes minimal to no discomfort in patients. Unless contraindicated we always apply topical anesthetics at the end of cystourethroscopy (e.g., lidocaine jelly). We do not prescribe post-operative antibiotics, unless the patient possesses risk factors for urosepsis and an endoscopic treatment is performed.12 Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for vesicoureteral reflux is continued until outpatient follow up after endoscopic injection. Dysuria or other storage lower urinary tract symptoms are treated with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and anticholinergics, if needed. Follow up is determined by patient diagnosis and intervention performed.\n\nUreteroscopy\n\nIndications\n\nUreteroscopy provides access to the upper urinary tract for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Improvement of optics and miniaturization of ureteroscopes allows ureteral and renal calculi formerly treated with shock wave lithotripsy to be managed ureteroscopically.14 The AUA/Endourology Society 2016 Guidelines on Surgical Management of Stones outlines ureteroscopy as an option for pediatric patients with a total renal stone burden of ≤ 20 mm.15 Additional indications include laser incision for short ureteral strictures, endopyelotomy for recurrent ureteropelvic junction obstruction (in select cases), and evaluation of lateralizing gross hematuria and ureteral filling defects.\n\nEquipment\n\nUreteroscopes are available in digital and fiberoptic flexible and semirigid models with a variety of sizes ranging from 4.5–11 Fr.16 Semirigid ureteroscopes are smaller as fiberoptics are incorporated into the endoscope and require an external light and camera source. Two channels, one used for irrigation and the other for instrument passage, improves visualization. Semirigid ureteroscopes are used in the ureter distal to the iliac vessels.17 Microureteroscopes such as the 4.5 Fr Ultrathin semirigid ureteroscope (Richard Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany) reduce access failure in small caliber pediatric ureters.18 Flexible ureteroscopes incorporate an optical system, deflection mechanism and working channel. Digital models include the light source and camera built into the endoscope whereas fiberoptic models require an external camera and light source. Distal tip deflection up to 270˚ allows navigation of tortuous ureters and the renal pelvis and calyces.19 The flexible ureteroscope is preferred for use in the ureter proximal to the iliac vessels and the renal pelvis and calyces. The flexible ureteroscope’s deflection mechanism is delicate, and can become damaged with repeated use. Its working channel can sustain damage from instrument passage or inadvertent laser firing within the endoscope, leading to device malfunction.11 Accordingly, single use flexible ureteroscopes are gaining popularity as they demonstrate similar efficacy as conventional flexible ureteroscopes and may offer cost savings.20 At present, their role in the pediatric patient remains to be elucidated.\n\nUreteroscopy should be performed in an endoscopy suite well equipped with all necessary supplies, fluoroscopy and experienced operating room personnel. Basic equipment necessary for ureteroscopy includes endoscopes (semirigid and flexible), a holmium laser and laser fibers, guide wires, open ended ureteral catheters, dual lumen catheters, coaxial dilators, ureteral access sheaths, baskets and ureteral stents. A variety of sizes of disposable instruments should be available and tailored to the child’s size.\n\nPreoperative Considerations\n\nA urine culture should be performed prior to urinary tract instrumentation. If a urinary tract infection or chronic bacterial colonization is present, the patient should be treated with culture specific antibiotics and the procedure postponed due to the risk of bacteremia and sepsis.11 The AUA Best Practice Statement on Urologic Procedures and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in 2019 recommends a single dose of perioperative TMP-SMX or a 1st or 2nd generation cephalosporin for ureteroscopic procedures.12 Although no specific guideline exists specifically for pediatric patients, it is our practice to use cefazolin with or without gentamicin prior to ureteroscopy.\n\nWhile the goal of ureteroscopy with stone extraction is to achieve complete stone clearance with as few procedures as possible, multiple procedures may be necessary to successfully treat ureteral or renal stones in children. The small caliber of pediatric ureters, especially in young children, can make direct ureteral access difficult. In cases of access failure, ureteral stenting provides passive ureteral dilation and can increase likelihood of successful access in the future. However, routine preprocedural stenting is not recommended.15\n\nSurgical Technique\n\nFollowing induction of general anesthesia and administration of guideline-directed antibiotic prophylaxis, the patient is positioned into dorsal lithotomy as discussed previously. Isotonic saline irrigation fluid warmed to body temperature is used, given the risk of absorption and hyponatremia.11 A cystoscope is used to gain ureteral access, and a retrograde pyelogram is performed to define collecting system anatomy and determine stone location. A safety guide wire (0.025–0.038 inch) is placed. A working guide wire can also be placed at this time, which allows passage of a ureteral access sheath or flexible ureteroscope. The ureteroscope is introduced into the ureteral orifice following hydrodilation using a hand irrigation pump and is advanced to the stone.21 If the ureteroscope does not pass, a ureteral stent is placed to allow passive ureteral dilation for 2–3 weeks prior to repeating ureteroscopy. Alternatively, active ureteral dilation with an 8–10 Fr dual lumen catheter or coaxial dilator may be employed, but balloon dilation of the ureteral orifice should be avoided due to risk of ureteral stricture.22 If the stone is too large for en bloc basketing, a Holmium:YAG laser is used to treat the stone using fragmentation (high energy, low frequency) or dusting (low energy, high frequency) settings. Large stone fragments are basket extracted and sent for stone analysis and smaller fragments (&lt; 1mm) are left in situ to pass spontaneously. Ureteral access sheaths (9.5–14 Fr) should be used for large proximal ureteral or renal stones, as use is shown to decrease intrarenal pressures, facilitate multiple scope passes and protect the ureter from trauma.23 However, use of a ureteral access sheath is not always feasible due to the small caliber of pediatric ureters. Following completion of lithotripsy, a ureteral stent may be placed. The decision to place a ureteral stent is based on operative time, stone burden, ureteral edema and trauma during the procedure. In select cases, ureteral stents are placed with an externalized string allowing removal without a second procedure. Use of x-ray during the procedure should follow the ALARA concept (as low as reasonably achievable) as children with nephrolithiasis often require more imaging in the future.24 Use of intermittent, low dose x-ray with maximal skin to target distance, narrow image window and avoidance of magnification can reduce procedural radiation exposure.25\n\nComplications\n\nContemporary series report overall complication rates of ureteroscopy ranging from 0-14% in pediatric patients and include urinary tract infection, hematuria, renal colic, post-operative hydronephrosis and ureteral injury.18,26,27,28 More severe complications (&gt; Clavien 3) are rare, with complete ureteral avulsion and sepsis occurring in &lt;1% of patients.29 Younger age may be associated with an increased risk of complications following ureteroscopic procedures. A systematic review of 10 studies (1,377 procedures) demonstrated a higher complication rate in children &lt; 6 years (24%) compared to children &gt; 6 years (7.1%).28\n\nPostoperative Care and Follow Up\n\nUreteroscopy is an outpatient surgical procedure in most cases. Postoperative pain is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and use of opioid analgesics is limited. A recent double blinded, randomized control trial in adult patients demonstrated 10mg of ketorolac to be noninferior to 5mg of oxycodone for treatment of pain after ureteroscopy.30 Patients with ureteral stents are prescribed anticholinergics and alpha blockers, as use may reduce ureteral stent associated symptoms.31,32 Silent ureteral obstruction following ureteroscopy occurs in up to 3% of patients. Therefore, it is our practice to perform a renal ultrasound 4 weeks after ureteroscopy in all patients.33\n\nNephroscopy\n\nIndications\n\nPercutaneous nephroscopy with nephrolithotomy is the mainstay of treatment for large renal stones and stones in kidneys with anatomic anomalies that preclude shock wave lithotripsy or retrograde intrarenal surgery. Historically, concerns existed that using adult sized instruments and sheaths (24–30 Fr) in pediatric kidneys would lead to parenchymal damage, and increase the risk of short and long-term complications.19 However, with improvement in technique and miniaturization of nephroscopes, percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is regarded as safe and effective in pediatric patients.34 The 2016 AUA/Endourology Society Guidelines on the Surgical Management of Stones recommend PCNL as a treatment option for total renal stone burden of &gt;20mm.15 Additionally, PCNL may be used to treat stones in calyceal diverticula, other anatomically complex kidneys, or when retrograde access is not feasible as with urinary diversion.\n\n\nFigure 5 Rigid Nephroscopy. X-ray imaging during relook PCNL for large renal stones using rigid nephroscope with mid-renal access.\n\nEquipment\n\nRigid nephroscopes allow visualization of the renal pelvis and calyces, are available in fiberoptic and digital models, and come in a variety of sizes (4.8–24 Fr).16 The fiberoptic rod-lens model requires an external camera and light source, while the digital model incorporates the endoscope, light source, and camera into the device.35 A working channel allows introduction of instruments and inflow and outflow ports allow simultaneous filling and emptying of the collecting system.\n\nIntracorporal lithotripters include both ultrasonic, pneumatic and combined models.35 An incorporated large caliber suction removes stone fragments and dust during lithotripsy.\n\nStandard PCNL involves use of a 24–30 Fr Amplatz sheath and adult-sized instruments. Given concern that the use of adult-sized instruments may increase complication rates in pediatric PCNL, techniques using smaller instruments were developed. Mini-PCNL describes use of nephrostomy tracts 15–24 Fr, ultra-mini PCNL with tracts 11–15 Fr and micro-PCNL with tracts &lt; 10 Fr.16 Procedures should be performed in an operating room with experienced personnel, fluoroscopy and appropriate equipment in a variety of sizes. Instruments required for PCNL include rigid and flexible nephroscopes, balloon or Amplatz dilators, access sheaths, Holmium:YAG laser, pneumatic or ultrasonic lithotripter, guide wires, ureteral catheters, dual lumen catheters and baskets.\n\nPreoperative Considerations\n\nAll patients considered for PCNL should undergo a low dose CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to determine feasibility and assess total renal stone burden.15 In addition, cross sectional imaging allows determination of optimal calyx for access, proximity to surrounding organs (colon, pleura, ribs), and alterations in renal anatomy.\n\nA preoperative urine culture should be performed and all patients with a urinary tract infection treated with culture specific antibiotics prior to the procedure. It is important to note that a lower urinary tract culture may not be reflective of stone or urine cultures from the upper tract. The 2019 AUA Best Practice Statement on Urological Procedures and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis recommends the following antibiotic options prior to PCNL based on high quality literature in adult patients: 1st/2nd generation cephalosporin, aminoglycoside and metronidazole, aztreonam and metronidazole, aminoglycoside and clindamycin or aztreonam and clindamycin.12 Literature regarding preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis prior to PCNL in pediatric patients is limited. A retrospective review of 830 children age &lt; 12 years examined the rate of febrile urinary tract infection after PCNL. First, second and third generation cephalosporins were found to be equally efficacious for prophylaxis in children &lt; 12 undergoing PCNL.36 It is our practice to use cefazolin and gentamicin as antibiotic prophylaxis prior to PCNL.\n\nSurgical Considerations\n\nFollowing induction of general anesthesia and administration of intravenous antibiotics, the patient is positioned prone over gel rolls. Percutaneous access into the desired calyx is performed using fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance. Alternatively, interventional radiology can obtain CT guided percutaneous access in cases of aberrant anatomy or spinal dysraphism. Multiple accesses may be needed for treatment of partial or complete staghorn calculi. A working and safety guide wire are placed, skin is incised and the tract is dilated with a balloon or Amplatz dilators, based on surgeon preference. Choice of dilator and sheath size is based on patient age, body habitus, anatomy, stone burden, and available nephroscope size. Note that pediatric kidneys are more mobile than adult kidneys and may push away when dilating or advancing the sheath.37 The sheath is then placed over the dilator into the collecting system. Trimming the sheath may improve maneuverability. Warmed isotonic fluid is used given propensity for hypothermia and hypervolemia. The rigid nephroscope is advanced to the stone and fragmentation commences, using either a Holmium:YAG laser or lithotripter. Stone fragments are extracted and sent for stone analysis and culture. A flexible cystoscope or ureteroscope is used to perform flexible nephroscopy and residual stone fragments are extracted. Following clearance of stone burden, a percutaneous nephrostomy tube, ureteral stent or both may be placed. This decision is based on surgical complexity, residual stone burden, need for relook procedure and surgeon preference.38 We recommend limiting operative time to 90 minutes as prolonged operative times increase the risk of postoperative febrile UTI.36\n\n\nFigure 6 Percutaneous Nephrolithtomy. Ultrasonic lithotripsy of a large renal stone during percutaneous nephrolithotomy.\n\nComplications\n\nContemporary series report complication rates following pediatric PCNL of 11–40%.34,39 The most common complications are febrile urinary tract infection and bleeding requiring transfusion.34,39 Severe complications such as massive bleeding, urine leak requiring drainage, visceral injury (colon, pleura), renal pelvis injury and hydrothorax are rare, with 84% of complications &lt; Clavien grade III.34,39 Stone size, case complexity and operative time are associated with complication rates.34,40 Ultra-mini and micro PCNL using smaller access tracts demonstrate lower overall complication rates (11.2%).41\n\nPostoperative Care and Follow Up\n\nFollowing PCNL, patients are hospitalized for 2–5 days. Perioperative antibiotics are continued for 24 hours after surgery. Laboratory tests are obtained to evaluate for electrolyte abnormalities and/or significant blood loss. Postoperative imaging is obtained to evaluate for residual stone burden and plan additional surgical treatment. If no relook PCNL is planned and gross hematuria has cleared, the nephrostomy tube is removed prior to hospital discharge. Frequently, additional procedures are required to achieve complete stone clearance. Stone free rates following PCNL range from 63–85.4% and increase to 91.7–93.7% with subsequent treatment (re-look PCNL, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery).34,42,43\n\nConclusions\n\nTechnologic advancements in endoscopic equipment have transformed the field of pediatric urology, improving diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Conditions formerly treated with open surgical procedures are now managed endoscopically. As device innovation progresses at an exponential rate, so too should high quality prospective studies to elucidate the role of this new technology in the pediatric urologist’s armamentarium.\n\nKey Points\n\n  Miniturization of adult endoscopic instruments and improvements in technology led to the development of pediatric cystoscopes, ureteroscopes and nephroscopes\n  Choice of endoscope type and size should be tailored to the child’s age, size, body habitus and unique anatomy\n  Routine preprocedural antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for uncomplicated cystoscopy, but is indicated for upper urinary tract instrumentation\n  When performing pediatric endoscopy, we should follow the ALARA concept to limit procedural radiation exposure\n  Complete stone clearance with ureteroscopy or PCNL may require multiple procedures given the small caliber of the pediatric collecting system and ureter\n\n\nResources for Patients\n\n\n  https://www.urologyhealth.org/healthy-living/urologyhealth-extra/magazine-archives/summer-2020/kidney-stones-in-children\n  https://pedsnet.org/pkids/\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Tekgül S, Stein R, Bogaert G, Nijman RJM, Quaedackers J, Hoen L ’t, et al..

        "content": "Introduction\n\nPediatric postoperative care is a critical aspect of any surgical procedure, and it plays a significant role in the child's recovery. The postoperative management of the pediatric patient is essential to prevent complications and ensure optimal healing. This chapter will discuss the postoperative management of the pediatric patient, including intravenous fluids, electrolyte balance, TPN, and pain management.\n\nIntravenous Fluids\n\nIntravenous (IV) fluids are an essential component of postoperative management for pediatric patients. Children who undergo surgical procedures may experience fluid loss due to anesthesia and surgery, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and hypovolemia. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain adequate fluid volume to ensure proper organ function and to prevent postoperative complications.\n\nThere are various types of IV fluids used in postoperative management, including isotonic, hypotonic, and (rarely) hypertonic solutions (Table 1). Isotonic solutions, such as 0.9% saline and lactated Ringer's solution, are commonly used in pediatric patients as they have the same osmolarity as the body's extracellular fluid. These solutions help to maintain fluid balance and prevent dehydration. Dextrose (most commonly 5%) may be added for caloric support in patients who are not taking enteral support.\n\nHypotonic solutions, such as 0.45% saline, are used when there is a need for hydration but no significant fluid loss. These solutions have a lower osmolarity than the body's extracellular fluid and can lead to hyponatremia and cerebral edema in excess.\n\nHypertonic solutions, such as 3% saline, are only used to treat severe hyponatremia or hypovolemia. However, these solutions must be used cautiously in pediatric patients, as they can lead to electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.\n\nThe choice of IV fluid and the rate of administration depends on the child's age, weight, medical history, and the type of surgery performed. It is essential to monitor the child's fluid intake and output to prevent fluid overload or dehydration.\n\nThe suggested maintenance rate and type of intravenous fluids (IVF) in a postoperative pediatric urology patient can depend on various factors such as the patient's age, weight, underlying medical conditions, type and duration of surgery, and fluid and electrolyte balance. In general, the maintenance fluid requirements for pediatric patients can be calculated using the Holliday-Segar method, which recommends a daily fluid intake of 100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg of body weight, plus 50 mL/kg for the next 10 kg, and 20 mL/kg for each additional kilogram.1\n\nThe 4-2-1 rule is a simplified method to estimate the maintenance fluid requirements for pediatric patients.2 It suggests that the daily maintenance fluid requirement for a child who weighs less than 10 kg is 4 mL/kg/hour, for a child who weighs between 10–20 kg is 2 mL/kg/hour, and for a child who weighs over 20 kg is 1 mL/kg/hour. This rule can be used as a quick estimate for the initial fluid rate in a stable pediatric patient who does not have significant fluid losses or electrolyte imbalances.\n\nTable 1 Common postoperative intravenous fluid compositions, including indications, pros and cons.\n\n\n  \n    \n      IVF Composition\n      Composition (per liter)\n      Indications\n      Advantages\n      Disadvantages\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Normal saline (0.9% NaCl)\n      154 mEq Na+154 mEq Cl-\n      Used for isotonic volume resuscitation in patients with hypovolemia, dehydration, or shock.\n      Low cost, readily available\n      Can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, especially with large volumes or prolonged administration\n    \n    \n      Lactated Ringer’s (LR)\n      130 mEq Na+109 mEq Cl-28 mEq lactate4 mEq K+3 mEq Ca2+\n      Used for isotonic volume resuscitation in patients with hypovolemia, dehydration, or shock.\n      Contains additional electrolytes, mimicking plasma composition\n      May cause hyperkalemia, especially with renal insufficiency.\n    \n    \n      0.45% normal saline (NS)\n      77 mEq Na+77 mEq Cl-\n      Used for maintenance IVF when fluid restriction is needed.\n      Less likely to cause fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances than isotonic solutions.\n      May not provide adequate volume expansion in patients with significant dehydration or fluid losses.\n    \n    \n      D5W\n      50 g dextrose 278 mOsm/L\n      Used for maintenance IVF when fluid restriction is not needed.\n      Provides free water and calories, can help maintain euglycemia.\n      Provides no electrolytes or other nutrients, can lead to hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, or fluid overload if given in excess.\n    \n    \n      D5LR\n      50 g dextrose130 mEq Na+109 mEq Cl-28 mEq lactate4 mEq K+3 mEq Ca2+\n      Used for maintenance IVF when additional electrolytes are needed.\n      Combines the advantages of D5W and LR solutions.\n      May cause hyperkalemia, especially with renal insufficiency.\n    \n    \n      D5½NS (0.45% NaCl with 5% dextrose)\n      77 mEq Na+77 mEq Cl-50 g dextrose495 mOsm/L\n      Used for maintenance IVF when fluid restriction is not needed and additional electrolytes are needed.\n      Provides free water, calories, and some electrolytes.\n      May cause hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, or fluid overload if given in excess.\n    \n  \n\n\nElectrolyte Balance\n\nElectrolyte balance is critical in the postoperative management of the pediatric patient. Surgery and anesthesia can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to fluid loss and changes in organ function. Electrolyte imbalances can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and seizures.\n\nCommon electrolytes monitored in postoperative pediatric patients include sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. The normal range for sodium is 135–145 mEq/L, potassium is 3.5–5.0 mEq/L, calcium is 8.5–10.5 mg/dL, and magnesium is 1.5–2.5 mEq/L.\n\nIn the postoperative period, electrolyte imbalances can occur due to various factors, such as inadequate fluid intake, excessive fluid loss, medication use, and changes in organ function. In short-stay, healthy patients who are supporting themselves postoperatively with enteral nutrition, laboratory testing is probably not routinely indicated. Even for complex operations like creation of catheterizable channel or bladder augmentation or nephrectomy, we advocate for checking a basic metabolic panel on postoperative day 1. If that is normal and hospital course is otherwise normal, no further testing is done.\n\nCorrection of electrolyte imbalances can be achieved through various methods, including oral or IV replacement. Oral replacement is preferred when the child is alert and can tolerate oral intake. IV replacement is used when the child is unable to tolerate oral intake or when rapid correction is necessary.\n\nTotal Parenteral Nutrition\n\nTotal parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a form of specialized nutrition composed of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals used in pediatric patients who cannot tolerate oral or enteral feeding. TPN provides complete nutrition through an intravenous line, which allows nutrients to be directly absorbed by the body.\n\nIndications for TPN use in pediatric patients include short bowel syndrome, malabsorption syndromes, severe inflammatory bowel disease, and congenital anomalies. TPN is also used in the postoperative period when oral intake is contraindicated for prolonged periods (ileus, small bowel obstruction, critical illness requiring intubation and sedation).\n\nThere is limited evidence regarding the use of prophylactic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in pediatric patients undergoing complex lower urinary tract reconstruction. Some studies have suggested that TPN may be beneficial in this population by improving nutritional status, but this can also be associated with more postoperative complications and longer hospital stays.3 The decision to use TPN should be individualized and based on the patient's clinical status, nutritional needs, and potential risks and benefits. At our center, TPN is rarely used or needed outside of postoperative complications limiting enteral nutrition.\n\nPediatric Postoperative Pain Management\n\nEffective postoperative pain management is crucial for minimizing patient discomfort, reducing complications, and improving recovery outcomes. However, managing pain in pediatric patients can be challenging, as children may have difficulty communicating their pain and may require different approaches to pain management than adults.\n\nThe use of opioids for postoperative pain management in children has been associated with adverse events, including respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and sedation. Therefore, multimodal analgesia techniques are often employed to minimize opioid use and improve pain control.\n\nCommon Regional Blocks in Pediatric Patients\n\nRegional anesthesia techniques, such as nerve blocks, have been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative pain and opioid use in pediatric patients. Here are some common regional blocks used in pediatric patients:\n\n\n  Caudal block: This block involves injecting local anesthetic into the caudal epidural space to provide analgesia for lower abdominal, pelvic, and lower extremity surgeries.\n  Epidural block: This block involves injecting local anesthetic into the epidural space to provide analgesia for thoracic, abdominal, and lower extremity surgeries.\n  Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block: This block involves injecting local anesthetic into the plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles to provide analgesia for abdominal surgeries.\n\n\nStrategies for Minimizing Opioid Use\n\nIn addition to regional anesthesia techniques, there are several strategies for minimizing opioid use in pediatric patients:\n\nPreemptive analgesia: Providing analgesia prior to the start of surgery can reduce the amount of pain experienced postoperatively. The gate control theory of pain proposes that the perception of pain can be modulated by the spinal cord's \"gate,\" which can be opened or closed by various inputs, including sensory signals from nerve fibers, as well as emotional and cognitive factors.4 Preemptive analgesia aims to close the gate by providing analgesic treatment before the onset of painful stimuli, which can reduce the overall pain experience and the need for postoperative pain control.5 For this reason, we encourage preoperative analgesia (oral medications in preoperative area and locoregional analgesia prior to incision) whenever possible.\n\n\nFigure 1 The gate control theory of pain proposes that modulation of sensory tracts prior to painful insult can reduce the overall pain experience and the need for postoperative pain control. We maximize this effect by providing preoperative analgesics orally or by applying logoregional blocks prior to incision.\n\nNon-opioid analgesics: Using non-opioid analgesics, such as acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can reduce the need for opioids and improve pain control. We schedule these postoperatively for all appropriate patients.\n\nPatient-controlled analgesia (PCA): PCA allows the patient to self-administer small doses of opioids as needed, reducing the risk of oversedation and respiratory depression.6 After the introduction of ERAS at our institution, PCA usage in pediatric urology is quite rare.\n\nRegional anesthesia techniques: As mentioned earlier, regional anesthesia techniques can reduce opioid use and improve pain control.7\n\nMultimodal analgesia: Combining multiple analgesic techniques, such as opioids, non-opioids, and regional anesthesia, can improve pain control and reduce the need for opioids.8\n\nEffective postoperative pain management is essential for improving recovery outcomes in pediatric patients. Regional anesthesia techniques, such as nerve blocks, are effective in reducing postoperative pain and opioid use. Additionally, strategies for minimizing opioid use, such as preemptive analgesia, non-opioid analgesics, PCA, regional anesthesia techniques, and multimodal analgesia, can improve pain control and reduce the need for opioids.\n\nPediatric Enhanced Recovery After Surgery\n\nEnhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal approach to perioperative care that aims to optimize patient outcomes by reducing surgical stress, promoting early recovery, and minimizing complications. ERAS protocols typically include interventions such as preoperative carbohydrate loading, minimally invasive surgery, opioid-sparing analgesia, early mobilization, and early oral intake.\n\nERAS protocols have been successfully implemented in adult surgical patients, and over the past few years, there has been increasing interest in applying this approach to the pediatric population. Several studies have shown that ERAS protocols can reduce length of stay, improve pain management, and decrease complications in children undergoing surgery.\n\nERAS can be applied to a variety of pediatric surgeries, including but not limited to:\n\n\n  Orthopedic surgery (e.g., spinal fusion)\n  General surgery (e.g., appendectomy)\n  Urologic surgery (e.g., nephrectomy, pyeloplasty, complex lower urinary tract reconstruction)9,10,11\n  Colorectal surgery (e.g., cecostomy/Malone procedures)\n  Cardiac surgery (e.g., repair of congenital heart defects)\n\n\nSeveral specialties have also implemented ERAS protocols in pediatric patients. For example, the Pediatric Colorectal and Pelvic Learning Consortium has developed an ERAS protocol for children undergoing surgery for anorectal malformations.12 Pediatric Urology Recovery after SUrgery Endeavor (PURSUE) is a multicenter working group aiming to demonstrate the value of ERAS care for patients undergoing complex lower urinary tract reconstruction.13\n\nIn summary, pediatric ERAS protocols are a promising approach to improving postoperative outcomes in children undergoing surgery. They can be applied to a variety of surgical specialties and procedures and have the potential to reduce length of stay, improve pain management, and decrease complications.\n\nStandardizing Care\n\nElectronic medical records (EMRs) have become an integral part of modern healthcare and can improve the efficiency and safety of postoperative care. EMRs can be used to facilitate the ordering of medications, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, as well as to document the patient's progress and response to treatment. In addition, EMRs can be used to develop order sets that standardize postoperative care and reduce variability in practice.14\n\nFor postoperative care of a pediatric urology patient, order sets may include orders for intravenous fluids, pain management medications, antibiotics, and key nursing communication points. EMRs can also incorporate clinical decision support tools to help guide the clinician in selecting the appropriate medications and dosages for the patient based on their age, weight, and medical history.\n\nWe have developed and maintained three order sets at our institution for all patients undergoing pediatric urology operations. These order sets help our team standardize care. In 2018, we added ERAS elements for both admission order sets shown below. In 2019, we removed routine opioids for postoperative pain control for outpatient surgery.\n\n\n  Pediatric Urology Outpatient Surgery Discharge (Figure 2)\n  Pediatric Urology Short-Stay Admission\n  Pediatric Urology Reconstruction Admission\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Listing of orders within the Pediatric Urology Outpatient Surgery Discharge order set at Children’s Hospital Colorado. Most sections have additional areas for documenting non-standard details that may be unique to the case, but these are rarely needed.\n\nWith the help of our antibiotic stewardship team, we opted to remove antibiotic options from postoperative admission and discharge order sets given the lack of supporting evidence for continuing antibiotics in most elective postoperative scenarios. The default selections and options available within the order set are deliberate choices on the part of our team to minimize variation, avoid therapeutic duplication, and enable standard care all while streamlining communication with nursing, avoiding overdiagnosis with unneeded scheduled testing (e.g., daily labs) and thus minimizing cost and potential harm to patients.\n\nConclusions\n\nPostoperative management of the pediatric patient requires a multifaceted approach that includes careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance, pain management, and nutritional support. Intravenous fluids are a crucial aspect of postoperative care, and the choice of IVF composition should be tailored to the individual patient's needs. TPN may be indicated in select patients, but its routine use in complex lower urinary tract reconstruction remains controversial. Regional blocks and multimodal analgesia can help reduce the need for opioid medications and improve pain control in the postoperative period. Enhanced recovery after surgery protocols have been shown to be quite beneficial for improving outcomes and reducing hospital length of stay. Overall, effective postoperative management requires a coordinated effort among the surgical team, nursing staff, and other healthcare professionals to optimize the patient's recovery and prevent complications.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Effective postoperative care is essential for minimizing complications, reducing discomfort, and improving recovery outcomes in pediatric patients.\n  Multimodal analgesia techniques, including regional blocks, preemptive analgesia, non-opioid analgesics, and patient-controlled analgesia, can help minimize opioid use and improve pain control in pediatric patients.\n  Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols can improve outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing a variety of surgeries by implementing evidence-based practices to reduce complications, decrease pain, and accelerate recovery.\n  Careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance, including appropriate use of intravenous fluids and total parenteral nutrition, is important in postoperative management of pediatric patients to maintain proper hydration and prevent complications.\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Rove KO, Edney JC, Brockel MA.

        "title": "Urinary Tract Infection Management",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nUrinary tract infections are a common problem in children, constituting one of the most frequent infections of bacterial origin in children under 2 years of age. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined as the colonization of the urinary tract, from the bladder to the renal parenchyma, by pathogenic microorganisms, frequently bacteria, associated with leukocyturia and variable symptoms, as we will see below.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe incidence of UTI is difficult to estimate because it varies depending on different variables such as age. In the first year of life, it is more common in boys (3.7%), as compared to girls (2%). This incidence starts to shift and in children 2 years and older, females have a two to four-fold higher prevalence of UTI than do circumcised males.1\n\nPrevalence of UTI varies according to age, gender and presence or not of circumcision. The highest prevalence is found in younger infants, girls and uncircumcised boys. Lastly, there is a high rate of UTI recurrence in children (12–30%), especially those with risk factors such as first UTI before 6 months, family history of UTI, dilated vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and bladder and bowel dysfunction. The goal of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment is to prevent UTI recurrence, promptly diagnose urinary tract malformations, and avoid long-term complications such as arterial hypertension, renal scarring, and impaired renal function.2\n\nPathogenesis and Etiology\n\nThe pathogenesis of UTI results of the interaction between host factors as well as virulent properties of the causative pathogens. A UTI is most commonly due to ascent of bacteria from the perineum into the urinary tract, but hematogenous spread also has a role, particularly on the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis.3 Bacteria can also be introduced iatrogenically with instrumentation of the urinary tract in surgery; or with catheters and stents within the urinary system.\n\nAscending infection of the urinary tract is a complex process that has been associated with bacterial adhesion, virulence, and motility properties as well as host anatomic, humoral, and genetic factors.4\n\nThe etiologic agent that most frequently causes UTI is Escherichia coli, corresponding to 80–90% of cases in children. Other gram-negative uropathogens are Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp. Within the gram-positive pathogens we find Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species and, with very low frequency, Staphylococcus aureus. Most pathogens originate in the fecal flora ascending to the urethra and bladder from the perineum.5\n\nClassification of Urinary Tract Infections\n\nThere are different classification systems according to site, episode, severity, symptoms and complicating factors. The more important concepts are:6,7\n\nLower urinary tract infection or cystitis which is the infection of the bladder and urethra. The symptoms are usually more classic given the local inflammation of the bladder and these include dysuria, polyakiuria, micturition urgency, hematuria, incontinence and, eventually, hypogastric pain. It is usually more frequent in female patients and those older than 2 years.\n\nUpper urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis (APN) corresponds to urinary tract infection that compromises the renal parenchyma, generating inflammation of the renal tissue. Its cardinal symptom is fever greater than or equal to 38º C. The symptoms in younger children are usually non-specific, presenting irritability, vomiting, lethargy, compromised general condition in addition to fever. In older children it is more frequent to find classic urinary symptoms, abdominal pain and low back pain. On some occasions it can present as fever without focus.\n\nAsymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) it is defined as the colonization of the urinary tract by bacteria without generating secondary inflammation. These patients do not present clinical symptoms, their complete urinalysis does not show inflammatory markers, but the urine culture is positive. Most resolve spontaneously and lack clinical significance.\n\nRecurrent UTI is defined as three or more episodes of lower UTI, two or more episodes of APN, or one episode of acute pyelonephritis plus one lower UTI within a year.\n\nAtypical or complicated UTI corresponds to an upper UTI that evolves torpidly. Other elements are usually present that suggest anatomical and functional alterations of the urinary tract. For example, failure to respond to antibiotic treatment at 48 hours, infection by a germ other than E. Coli, sepsis, increased creatininemia, urinary bladder retention, and weak urinary stream. It requires individualized management and study.\n\nClinical Manifestations\n\nThe clinical manifestations in UTI are varied and can become very non-specific, particularly in infants and preschoolers. Therefore, in all children with fever without a clear source, it is necessary to consider ruling out a urinary infection.8 Newborns usually debut with urosepsis. The patient is usually severely compromised, lethargic, irritable and refuses to eat. They may or may not have a fever. The symptoms are non-specific, so the clinician's suspicion is tremendously relevant.6 The symptoms in infants are not very different, however, they tend to be less severe, less septic patients. They usually present fever, lethargy, irritability, vomiting and abdominal pain. Only in preschool and older children do urinary symptoms appear such as dysuria, frequency and micturition urgency. They may report abdominal pain and new onset incontinence. When there is involvement of the upper urinary tract, they may report flank pain and tenderness at physical examination. When there is renal parenchyma involvement, they also present fever, a compromised general condition and vomiting. Infants with recurrent UTIs often have poor growth curves and even weight loss.9\n\nWhen evaluating a patient with suspected urinary infection, predisposing factors for UTI in children should be considered:10\n\nAge\n\nThe prevalence of UTI is higher in boys under 2 years of age and girls under 4 years of age.\n\nGender\n\nFemale patients have a 2 to 4 times higher prevalence of UTI than male patients.\n\nCircumcision\n\nFebrile uncircumcised male infants have a 4 to 8 times higher prevalence of UTI than circumcised boys. The mucosal surface of the uncircumcised foreskin is more likely to bind uropathogenic bacterial species than keratinized skin on a circumcised penis.11,12\n\nGenetics\n\nGenetic factors also influence the occurrence of UTI and predispose some children to develop renal scarring after upper urinary tract infection.13\n\nObstructive Urinary Pathology\n\nUrinary obstructions, whether anatomical, functional or neurogenic, predispose to urinary stasis and favor the development of UTI.\n\nVesicoureteral Reflux\n\nChildren with dilated VUR are at high risk of recurrent UTI. There is a close relationship between vesicoureteral reflux, pyelonephritis and renal scars that is under permanent discussion and review. We have transitioned from asserting a very direct cause – effect relationship between reflux, UTI and renal damage to the understanding that VUR remains a risk factor but is not sufficient for the development of renal scars.14\n\nBladder and Bowel Dysfunction\n\nUp to 40 percent of toilet-trained children with their first UTI and 80 percent of children with recurrent UTI have symptoms of bladder and bowel dysfunction when asked in detail. Bladder and bowel dysfunction is also a risk factor for persistent vesicoureteral reflux, renal scarring and recurrent UTIs.15\n\nBladder Catheterization and Instrumentation of the Urinary Tract\n\nThe risk of UTI increases with a longer duration of bladder catheterization.\n\nSexual Activity\n\nThe association between sexual activity and UTI in women has been demonstrated.\n\nMicrobiome\n\nThe microbiome of the urinary tract is being researched as a predisposing factor of UTI. Urobiota helps maintain bladder homeostasis in terms of maintaining the integrity of the urinary tract epithelium, protecting against infections and promoting the proper functioning of the immune system. Alterations of “normal urobiota” has been associated with urological diseases such as urinary tract infections, incontinence, overactive bladder, urolithiasis, and prostate or bladder cancer. This means that dysbiosis has an important role in long term evolution of UTIs.16\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nGiven the diagnostic suspicion of UTI, a complete urine test and a urine culture should be ordered. Diagnostic confirmation is through a positive urine culture and the number of colony-forming units (CFU) present in the culture. There are non-invasive collection methods such as bag specimen, midstream collection of urine, and invasive methods such as transurethral catheterization and suprapubic bladder aspiration. The bag specimen has a high rate of contamination (more than 70% false positives), which is why when a urine culture is positive, the most appropriate thing is to confirm the diagnosis by taking a new sample. When the result is negative, it allows ruling out UTI. The sampling obtained by midstream collection is recommended in toilet trained children.17,18 In children that are not toilet trained, transurethral catheterization is the recommended method. When this is not possible, the alternative is suprapubic bladder aspiration, ideally under direct ultrasound vision.6 Whatever the method of choice, sampling requires several steps that reduce the risk of contamination. For example, washing the genitals with soap and water without antiseptics. The sample should be examined as soon as possible (fresh urine), if this is not possible it should be kept refrigerated at 2–8˚C for a maximum time of 24 hours.\n\nConsidering that the urine culture takes at least 18 hours of incubation, to report bacterial growth, we can support clinical suspicion by observing the chemical and microscopic analysis of the urine sample. The chemical study may show leukocyturia and positive nitrites.19\n\nMicroscopic examination is positive (pyuria) when there are more than ≥5 WBC/HPF or ≥10 WBC/mm3 in uncentrifuged urine. UTI is best defined as significant bacteriuria of a clinically relevant uropathogen in a symptomatic patient.6 Pyuria is present in most cases. However, in approximately 10–20 percent of children with UTI, pyuria may be absent.20\n\nUrine culture positivity depends of collection method and number of colony-forming units per milliliter.21\n\n\n  50,000 CFU/mL for samples obtained by catheterization\n  100,000 CFU/mL for samples obtained by midstream clean catch\n  1,000 CFU/mL for samples obtained by suprapubic aspiration\n\n\nIn those cases where there is doubt or disagreement between these diagnostic elements, complementary tests such as renal scintigram with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or renal doppler ultrasound may help confirm the diagnosis.14\n\nComplementary Studies\n\nThe objective of the imaging study in UTI is to diagnose urinary tract anomalies that may predispose to new urinary tract infections and, therefore, to parenchymal renal damage. Currently, there is no consensus on the images that should be performed in children presenting with a UTI episode. The recommendations are based on expert consensus or on a low level of evidence. In general, it is preferred to perform only the necessary tests, ideally less invasive and with less radiation exposure.\n\nRenal and Bladder Ultrasound\n\nIt is used to detect anatomical abnormalities such as dilatation of the collecting system, renal position and size, duplex kidneys, as well as bladder abnormalities. It allows evaluating the renal parenchyma, the presence of renal scars, cortico-medullary differentiation, etc.\n\nIn general, renal bladder ultrasound is performed on all patients after the first pyelonephritis, regardless of the patient's age. This is done at 6–8 weeks of the episode.\n\nIndications for early ultrasound, during the UTI episode are those patients with atypical UTI and those under 6 months with recurrent UTI.\n\nPatients with ultrasound alterations, it is recommended to repeat it once a year.\n\nLimitations: It is operator dependent. It depends on the patient's hydration status and has low sensitivity to detect vesicoureteral reflux.14\n\nDimercaptosuccinic Acid Scintigraphy\n\nThis study identifies renal parenchymal defects corresponding to renal scars. In the acute phase of a UTI episode, it can be diagnostic of infection, however, it is not indicated in this phase.\n\nIndications include:\n\n\n  Atypical UTI in children under 3 years of age.\n  Recurrent UTI in any patient regardless of age.\n  In patients where renal and bladder ultrasound suggest renal scarring.\n\n\nLimitations: Limited availability (not all hospitals have Nuclear Medicine units), low doses of radiation, but cumulative.\n\nVoiding Cystourethrography\n\nThis is the gold standard for diagnostic confirmation and classification of vesicoureteral reflux.\n\nIndications include:\n\n\n  UTI in children under 3 years of age with alterations in renal bladder ultrasound such as dilatation of the collecting system, renal scars, bladder alterations or patients with a family history of VUR.\n  Recurrent UTI in children under 3 years of age.\n  Atypical UTI in children under 6 months.\n\n\nLimitations: High doses of radiation, it’s an invasive exam and cannot be performed on a patient with UTI, it must be performed with a normal urine test and under antibiotic prophylaxis.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe objectives of UTI treatment are basically three: eradicate the infection, achieve clinical improvement for the patient, and minimize long-term complications, that is, prevent kidney damage. General measures include adequate hydration and management of pain or fever.\n\nEmpirical antibiotic treatment should be started while cultures are informed. On patients with uro-prophylaxis it is not recommended to use the same antibiotic used for prophylaxis.\n\n\n  Lower tract UTI: 1st generation cephalosporin for 3 to 5 days.\n  Upper tract UTI: it can be administered orally or parenterally, according to the clinical conditions and the age of the patient.6 Empirical antibiotic treatment alternatives in the case of an outpatient should be 2nd or 3rd generation cephalosporin (oral treatment), amikacin or ceftriaxone may be indicated every 24 hours IV. In hospitalized patients, amikacin can be administered as 1st choice. Alternatives are 2nd or 3rd generation cephalosporin. Treatment should be adjusted according to antibiotic sensitivity, after 24 hours afebrile and according to oral tolerance. If the UTI is associated with bacteremia, intravenous treatment is recommended for at least 5 days.14\n\n\nIndications for Hospitalization\n\n\n  Patients under 3 months of age\n  Toxic or septic patient\n  Poor oral tolerance\n  Dehydration\n  Poor response to adequate antibiotic treatment.\n  Doubtful compliance with antibiotic treatment\n  Urinary tract malformation (single kidney, obstructive uropathy, VUR, etc.)\n  Immunodeficiency\n  Hydroelectrolytic or renal function alteration.\n  In children under 3 months, ampicillin should be associated and in children with impaired renal function, aminoglycosides should not be used. The duration of treatment is 7–10 days.\n  Renal abscess: Treatment should last 21 days, initially bi-associated (3rd generation cephalosporin plus an aminoglycoside) and completed with oral antibiotic according to urine culture, after clinical improvement.\n\n\nOther Key Points of Treatment\n\nCircumcision\n\nThis procedure may be recommended in children under 1 year of age with febrile UTI and/or associated urological malformation.\n\nBladder and Bowel Dysfunction\n\nThis group of patients, given the high risk of UTI, have an indication for uroprophylaxis associated with the management of voiding and bowel dysfunction.\n\nProphylaxis\n\nThe use of antibiotic prophylaxis in healthy children after their first episode of UTI is not recommended. Indication for antibiotic prophylaxis have been limited in time. Common antibiotics used for prophylaxis, when indicated, are shown in Table 1. Nowadays it is indicated in:14\n\n\n  Children with complex congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)\n  Children with high grade reflux VUR grade IV and V\n  Patients with bladder dysfunction such as bladder and bowel dysfunction and lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD)22\n  Children with 3 or more UTI in a 12-month period. In this group, prophylaxis is indicated for a limited period of time (3 – 6 months)23\n\n\nTable 1 Common antibiotics and doses used for treatment and prophylaxis of urinary tract infections.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Antibiotic\n      Treatment dose\n      CAP dose\n      FDA approved indications\n      Common adverse effects\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      amoxicillin\n      25–45 mg/kg/day PO divided into 2 doses\n      15–20 mg/kg daily\n      any age, UTI treatment\n      cutaneous / allergic reactions, GI disturbances\n    \n    \n      cephalexin\n      25–50 mg/kg/day PO divided into 2–4 doses\n      25 mg/kg daily or divided into 1–2 doses\n      any age, UTI treatment\n      cutaneous / allergic reactions, GI disturbances\n    \n    \n      nitrofurantoin\n      5–7 mg/kg daily divided into 4 doses\n      1–2 mg/kg daily\n      &gt; 1 month age, UTI treatment or prophylaxis\n      hemolytic anemia, GI disturbances, interstitial pneumonitis, cutaneous / allergic reactions\n    \n    \n      trimethoprim\n      8–10 mg/kg TMP daily divided into 2 doses\n      2 mg/kg TMP daily\n      &gt; 12 years age, UTI treatment or prophylaxis\n      cutaneous /allergic reactions, hematological toxicity\n    \n    \n      Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole\n      8–10 mg/kg TMP daily divided into 2 doses\n      2 mg/kg TMP daily\n      &gt; 2 months age, UTI treatment or prophylaxis\n      cutaneous /allergic reactions, hematological toxicity, hepatotoxicity (kernicterus)\n    \n  \n\n\nSuggested Follow Up\n\nClinicians should be on alert about recurrent symptoms. Up to 30% of children with a UTI may present a reinfection. We have stablished that UTI, especially pyelonephritis is associated to renal scars. So, its relevant to diagnose and treat promptly these infections in order to prevent progression of renal scarring.\n\nRoutine surveillance cultures should not be performed in asymptomatic children after their first UTI because they do not improve timely identification of true UTI episodes. Further, treatment of patients who have bacteriuria without symptoms is unproven and may be harmful.24\n\nTherefore, we must train caregivers of young children about the risks of recurrent UTI and advised them to seek medical attention whenever their children present fever and or urinary symptoms.25\n\nIndications for referral to a pediatric nephrologist or urologist:26\n\n\n  Recurrent UTI\n  Patients with CAKUT\n  Dilating vesicoureteral reflux\n  Impaired kidney function\n  Elevated blood pressure\n  LUTS and BBD refractory to primary care measures\n\n\nConclusions\n\nUTI is a common infection in children. Most UTI are not clinically significant but others, such as pyelonephritis will develop renal scars. These scars, in time, may compromise a children’s renal function. Children at significant risk of chronic renal insufficiency appear to be those with CAKUT, particularly boys with renal dysplasia.\n\nWe as caregivers must be watchful of conditions that predispose to repeated urinary infections, taking care of them promptly and appropriately in order to prevent future renal damage. It is also important to identify and manage predisposing conditions such as lower urinary tract dysfunction and vesico ureteric reflux.22\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Urinary tract infections are an important cause of bacterial infections in children.\n  The common pathogenic sources are gram-negative organisms. E. coli is responsible for more than 80% of episodes of UTIs.\n  The most common risk factors are age, gender, circumcision status, genitourinary abnormalities and genetic factors.\n  When facing a patient with a possible UTI always obtain a complete medical history, assess clinical signs and symptoms, perform a thorough physical examination and them ask for laboratory tests.\n  Management of a child with UTI is critical due to potential irreversible morbidities which can be avoided with proper treatment.\n  The main goal of treatment in the acute period is to cut down clinical signs and control infection avoiding impairment of renal parenchyma.\n  Long-term treatment involves preserving renal function by preventing possible renal scarring, preventing recurrent UTIs and correcting underlying urological abnormalities.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nShaikh N, Morone NE, Bost JE, Farrell MH.

        "title": "Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nCongenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are a group of structural abnormalities that affect the kidneys and urinary tract. It is estimated that there are approximately 4 to 60 cases per 10,000 births in the overall population. A CAKUT diagnosis is typically made during a routine prenatal ultrasound examination or postnatally in a newborn with associated clinical signs and symptoms.1 The prevalence of CAKUT in preterm infants was 2% in recent large, reported cohort with 409704 infants.2\n\nThe most common anomaly is ureteropelvic junction obstruction, which affects approximately 20% of individuals with the condition. Among the other types of CAKUT, there is multicystic dysplastic kidneys, renal agenesis, renal dysplasia, renal hypoplasia, vesicoureteral reflux, megaureter, duplex collecting system, ectopic ureter, and posterior urethral valves (Figure 1).\n\nDespite the significant progress made in the detection and diagnosis of CAKUT, the underlying causes of the condition are still not fully understood. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the embryologic, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to CAKUT development and to better understand their underlying causes and improve prevention and treatment strategies.\n\n\nFigure 1 Illustrative 3D models of congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT).3\n\nEmbryology\n\nThe development of the kidneys and urinary tract in the fetus involves a complex process that begins in the early weeks of pregnancy and involves the formation and differentiation of several structures. This process begins with the formation of the ureteric buds, which arise from the intermediate mesoderm and give rise to the collecting ducts and ultimately the kidneys. The kidneys also develop from a structure called the metanephros, which forms from the mesoderm in the embryo.\n\nDuring development, the ureteric buds and metanephros must properly connect and differentiate to form the functional kidneys and urinary tract. Disruptions in this process can lead to a range of congenital anomalies.\n\nCAKUT can be categorized by locations (kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra), by cause (genetic mutations, environmental exposures, infections during pregnancy etc.), by inheritance, and by severity (Table 1). In 10% to 25% of cases, CAKUT is attributed to genetic disorders. CAKUT exhibits complex phenotypic manifestations in association with genetic disorders (Figure 2 and Figure 3).4 It is possible for individuals with the same genome abnormalities to manifest with different forms of CAKUT, and similar phenotypic anomalies may arise because of different genetic disorders, and with associated with extrarenal diseases.2\n\nTable 1 Categories of CAKUT disorders\n\n\n  \n    \n      Kidney\n      Collecting System\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Number: Renal agenesis\n      Ureteropelvic junction obstruction\n    \n    \n      Morphology: Renal hypoplasia, dysplasia, MCDK\n      Vesicoureteral reflux\n    \n    \n      Position: Horseshoe, ectopic, pelvic kidneys\n      Megaureter\n    \n    \n       \n      Duplex system\n    \n    \n       \n      PUV\n    \n  \n\n\nSeveral malformations of the kidney parenchyma result in a failure of the normal development of the nephrons, including cystic dysplasia, renal dysplasia, renal agenesis, renal tubular dysgenesis, and renal tubular dysgenesis.\n\nPolycystic Kidney Disease\n\nThe term polycystic kidney disease is generally used to describe a disease in which there are multiple cysts on kidneys without associated dysplasia.\n\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) are the two most common types of polycystic kidney disease. In addition to the inheritance pattern, whether dominant or recessive inheritance, ARPKD and ADPKD differ in terms of their clinical manifestations and prognoses. ADPKD is the most common form of PKD, and it is caused by mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes.\n\nGenes implicated in the development of renal cystic disease:5,6\n\n\n  PKD1: This gene is associated with ADPKD. Mutations in the PKD1 gene are responsible for about 85% of cases of ADPKD.\n  PKD2: This gene is also associated with ADPKD. Mutations in the PKD2 gene are responsible for about 15% of cases of ADPKD.\n  HNF1β: Mutations in this gene are associated with an autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease type 2 (ADPKD2).\n  REN: This gene is associated with an infantile polycystic kidney disease.\n  MUC1: Mutations in this gene are associated with a MUC1-related medullary cystic kidney disease.\n  INVS: Mutations in this gene are associated with a nephronophthisis-related medullary cystic kidney disease.\n  NPHP1, NPHP3, NPHP4, NPHP5, NPHP6, NPHP7, NPHP8, NPHP9: These genes are associated with a nephronophthisis-related medullary cystic kidney disease.\n  BMP7: Mutations in this gene are associated with a nephronophthisis-related medullary cystic kidney disease\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Proportion of patients with known genomic disorders in different human developmental phenotypes and healthy controls.4\n\n\nFigure 3 Differences and similarities in the prevalence of the four most commonly implicated CNV loci in CAKUT patients.4\n\nMCDK\n\nMCDK is non-inherited congenital cystic diseases, a type of renal dysplasia that causes multiple non-communicating cysts separated by dysplastic parenchyma. The prevalence of MCDK is about 1 in 3,600 to 1 in 4,300 live births.7,8 The cause of MCDK is unknown, but it is thought to potentially be related to abnormal formation of the ureteric bud, exposure to teratogens, or urinary tract obstruction. MCDK is often detected through antenatal ultrasonography. As it often does not cause symptoms or complications, it is usually only identified postnatally if there is a noticeable mass or if it is discovered incidentally during imaging for another condition.\n\nSome of the genes that have been associated with MCDK include:9,10,11\n\n\n  HNF1β: This gene encodes a protein called hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta, which plays a role in the development and function of the kidney and other organs. Mutations in HNF1β can cause a range of renal anomalies, including MCDK.\n  PAX2: This gene encodes a protein called paired box 2, which is important for the development of the ureter, the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. Mutations in PAX2 can cause MCDK and other renal anomalies.\n  SIX1: This gene encodes a protein called sine oculis homeobox 1, which is involved in the development of various organs, including the kidney. Mutations in SIX1 can cause MCDK and other renal anomalies.\n  WT1: This gene encodes a protein called Wilms tumor 1, which is important for the development of the kidney and other organs. Mutations in WT1 can cause MCDK and other renal anomalies.\n\n\nMCDK is typically managed conservatively (i.e., observation) as most cases without any long-term complications. Patients with contralateral abnormalities may experience kidney impairment over time. Thus, long-term follow-up is necessary.\n\nRenal Agenesis\n\nWhen compared to bilateral renal agenesis, unilateral renal agenesis occurs in one out of every 1000 pregnancies and has a favorable prognosis. It is estimated that between 0.1% and 0.3% of 1,000 births are affected by bilateral renal agenesis, which generally results in poor survival rates. Several inheritance patterns have been described in families with renal agenesis, which may occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome.12\n\nUnilateral renal agenesis can be caused by mutations in several genes, including ATRX, RET, BMP4, FRAS1, FREM1, GRIP1, GLI3, UPK3A, and more. In addition, bilateral renal agenesis can be caused by mutations in the RET, FGF20, ITGA8 genes. Related genes listed on the Table 2.13,14\n\nRenal Dysplasia\n\nRenal hypodysplasia results from a developmental arrest during the first trimester of the fetal life of the metanephric renal blastema. However, it remains unknown what causes renal hypodysplasia; vascular abnormalities in utero as well as genetic development disorders are two possible mechanisms. It is possible for renal hypodysplasia to be an isolated finding or part of a genetic syndrome associated with malformations of the urinary tract. An analysis of developmental genes (HNF1β, PAX2, EYA1, SIX1, and SALL1) involved in renal dysplasia in a large cohort of children with renal hypodysplasia was provided by the ESCAPE Study. According to this study, PAX2 mutations were diagnosed in 15% of patients with renal pathology, and those with genetic deletions or mutations of large genes demonstrated variable renal phenotypes. In addition, 22% of all patients with cystic renal hypodysplasia had a mutation in HNF1, suggesting that individuals with cystic renal dysplasia be screened for HNF1 mutations.15 Renal ultrasonography findings that show reduced renal size and loss of corticomedullary differentiation are clinically indicative of renal hypodysplasia. The development of the end-stage renal disease can develop in some patients with renal hypodysplasia over time. A specific treatment is not available for renal hypodysplasia. It is important to follow up and manage renal functions during years. For patients who develop end-stage renal disease, renal transplantation is the preferred option.\n\nUreteropelvic Junction\n\nThe most common pathological cause of neonatal hydronephrosis is obstruction of the upper part of the ureter. The overall incidence is 1:1,500, with a ratio of 2:1 in newborn males to females.16 An obstruction to the UPJ is usually caused by intrinsic stenosis or, less commonly, by a crossing vessel that causes external compression at the upper part of the ureter. A possible mechanism is that there is an embryological disruption in the proximal ureter that alters the development of circular musculature, by altering collagen fibers and composition between and around the muscular cells.\n\nSeveral single gene mutations are implicated in UPJO, including Id2, PAX2, EYA, AGTR2, BMP4, SOX17, CHD1L, and DSTYK.17,18 Id2 and Adamts1 are reported to produce a phenotype that is like the human UPJO phenotype. Mice lacking Id2 also exhibit a high ureter insertion into renal pelvis.19\n\nVesicoureteral Reflux\n\nSeveral genes have been identified that are associated with the development of VUR. Some of these genes are involved in the development and function of the ureteral smooth muscle. Other genes are involved in the development and function of the bladder. The high prevalence of VUR among twins, siblings, and offspring, suggests a genetic basis for this disease. It has been established that VUR is a genetically heterogeneous disease based on the results of genetic studies in various populations. A genome-wide linkage and association study linked primary non-syndromic VUR to the 10q26 region of the genome.20,21 Other genes that have been associated with the development of VUR include the FOXC1 gene, the MYH11 gene, and the ACTN4 gene. These genes play various roles in the development and function of the urinary tract.22,23 A genome-wide association study using the largest copy number variant analysis and genome-wide association study of VUR is resulting in the identification of five loci which may be associated with VUR, including WDPCP, OTX1, BMP5, WDPCP, and WNT5 with large effects. WNT5 may play a role in the development of the urogenital system. A genome-wide association study using the largest copy number variant analysis and genome-wide association study of VUR is resulting in the identification of five loci which may be associated with VUR, including WDPCP, OTX1, BMP5, WDPCP, and WNT5 with large effects. WNT5 may play a role in the development of the urogenital system.24\n\nPosterior Urethral Valves\n\nA posterior urethral valve is a life-threatening congenital anomaly of the urinary tract that is usually discovered during neonatal development and, despite optimal treatment, results in high rates of renal insufficiency. PUV is estimated to occur in 1 in 7,000–8,000 live births.25\n\nThere is a wide range of reports that indicate that PUV is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in newborn males, and ESRD can occur in a range of 5% to 64% of cases.26,27 A systematic review reported that chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are associated with PUV patients at up to a 32% and 20% risk, respectively.28\n\nTo date, few genes have been identified that are associated with posterior urethral valves. Prune Belly syndrome has been linked to HNF1B in only 3% of cases recognized, and most of those diagnosed do not have a genetic cause. Among the CAKUT abnormalities associated with Trisomy 21, posterior urethral valves, pyelectasis, and megaureters are included.29,30\n\nTable 2 A summary of the genes involved in the development of CAKUT.31,32,33,22,23,34,35,36\n\n\n  \n    \n      Disorder\n      Genes\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Renal Hypoplasia/Dysplasia\n      ACE, AGT, ATRX, CHD7, ESCO2, EYA1, SIX1, FRAS1, FREM2, GATA3, GLI3, GPC3, GRIP1, HNF1β, JAG1, KAL1, LRP4, MKS1–4, NIPBL, PAX2, PBX1, REN, SALL1, SIX5\n    \n    \n      Renal Agenesis\n      ATRX, BMP4, CBP/EP300, CHD7, ESCO2, FGF20, FRAS1, FREM2, GATA3, GRIP1, GLI3, HNF1β, ITGA8, JAG1, KAL1, KAL2, RET, SALL1, VANGL1\n    \n    \n      Cystic dysplasia\n      CBP/EP300, DHCR7, EVC, EVC2, FRAS1, FREM2, GPC-3, HNF1β, JAG1, KAL1, KAL2, MKS1–4, NS1, PEX, PAX2, WT1\n    \n    \n      Duplex system\n      NS1\n    \n    \n      Horseshoe/Ectopic kidney\n      GLI3, NIPBL, VANGL1\n    \n    \n      Hydronephrosis, UPJ\n      ACE, Adamts-1, AGT, ATRX, BMP4, CHD1L, CHD7, DHCR7, DSTYK, ESCO2, EYA, FRAS1, FREM2, GLI3, HSPG2, JAG1, Id2, NS1, PAX2, PEX, RET, SOX17, VANGL1\n    \n    \n      Hidroureter, Megaureter\n      CHD7, GLI3\n    \n    \n      VUR\n      ATRX, DHCR7, EYA1, FOX1, GATA3, HOXA13, HPSE2, JAG1, KAL1, KAL2, MYH11, NIPBL, PAX2, SALL1, SIX1, SIX5\n    \n    \n      PUV\n      BNC2, SALL1\n    \n  \n\n\nClinical Importance and Future Implications of Gene Knowledge\n\nAs the field of genetic evaluation continues to advance, it is likely that we will see an increasing ability to identify the genetic causes of CAKUT and to predict the likelihood of developing these conditions. This could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, which could improve outcomes for affected individuals.\n\nIt should be noted that genetic testing is not always necessary for diagnosing CAKUT. A definitive diagnosis is typically made based on a combination of clinical presentation, medical history, and imaging studies. Genetic testing for CAKUT is usually performed in a specialized center under the supervision of a clinical geneticist, as the interpretation of these results can be complex and may have implications for reproductive decisions. Several laboratories (PreventionGenetics, Invitae, Blueprint Genetics, etc.) offer genetic testing for several different CAKUT disorders. Their test panel for CAKUT includes genetic testing for multiple genes that are associated with CAKUT disorders, including HNF1B, NPHP1, and UPK1B. Genetic testing for these disorders can help to confirm a diagnosis, provide information about the severity of the disorder, and aid in genetic counseling and family planning. It is worth noting that other genetic testing companies and laboratories might also have CAKUT as a panel. Since CAKUT is a group of disorders caused by different genetic mutations, the genetic panel test for CAKUT in some companies might not include all the genetic causes of CAKUT, and different laboratories may have a different list of genes covered.\n\nA complete understanding of the genetic components of CAKUT is essential for developing accurate genetic testing strategies. In addition, this understanding will aid in the guidance of clinical decision-making in genetic testing. Including significant clinical outcomes and renal function, longitudinal studies are required to investigate the long-term effects of early diagnosis and management of CAKUT.\n\nConclusion and Summary\n\nCongenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are structural abnormalities that affect the kidneys and urinary tract. It is estimated that there are around 4–60 cases per 10,000 births. A CAKUT diagnosis is usually made during a prenatal ultrasound or after birth in newborns with associated clinical signs and symptoms. The most common anomaly is ureteropelvic junction obstruction, which affects approximately 20% of people with the condition. The development of the kidneys and urinary tract involves the formation and differentiation of several structures, including the ureteric buds and metanephros, which must properly connect to form the functional kidneys and urinary tract. Disruptions in this process can lead to CAKUT. There are various categories of CAKUT disorders including those affecting the number, morphology, and position of the kidneys, and those affecting the collecting system. In 10–25% of cases, CAKUT is caused by genetic disorders. Several genes have been identified that are associated with the development of various kidney related diseases. Research is ongoing to improve our understanding of the causes of CAKUT and to develop better prevention and treatment strategies. Despite its current limitations and difficulties, molecular genetic diagnosis may provide hope for improving the clinical management of patients with CAKUT in the future.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are a group of structural abnormalities that affect the kidneys and urinary tract, with an estimated 4 to 60 cases per 10,000 births in the overall population.\n  The development of the kidneys and urinary tract in the fetus involves a complex process that begins in the early weeks of pregnancy and involves the formation and differentiation of several structures.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nRenal cystic diseases make up a broad category of sporadic and genetic, congenital or acquired renal conditions that may involve the presence of a single cyst to many cysts of one or both kidneys (see heritable classifications in Table 1 below).1 Based on a 1987 Committee on Classification, Nomenclature, and Terminology, classification of renal cystic disease is primarily determined by genetic and nongenetic disease.2 Renal cystic diseases may largely be considered rare conditions, however they may be associated with serious consequences, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney failure, or hepatic disease. Despite their rarity, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common inherited human conditions. The possibility of serious complications from renal cystic diseases in the pediatric population, especially CKD, make early diagnosis and effective treatment modalities of certain importance.\n\nTable 1 Heritable classifications of renal cystic diseases.1\n\n\n  \n    \n      Inheritable\n      Nonheritable\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Autosomal recessive (infantile) polycystic kidney disease\n      Multicystic kidney (multicystic dysplastic kidney)\n    \n    \n      Autosomal dominant (adult) polycystic kidney disease\n      Benign multilocular cyst (cystic nephroma)\n    \n    \n      Juvenile nephronophthisis and medullary cystic disease complex\n      Simple cysts\n    \n    \n      Juvenile nephronophthisis (autosomal recessive)\n      Medullary sponge kidney\n    \n    \n      Medullary cystic disease (autosomal dominant)\n      Sporadic glomerulocystic kidney disease\n    \n    \n      Congenital nephrosis (familial nephrotic syndrome) (autosomal recessive)\n      Acquired renal cystic disease\n    \n    \n      Familial hypoplastic glomerulocystic disease (autosomal dominant)\n      Calyceal diverticulum (pyelogenic cyst)\n    \n    \n      Multiple malformation syndromes with renal cysts (e.g., tuberous sclerosis, von Hippel-Lindau disease)\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nEmbryology\n\nCysts typically occur secondary to secretory, absorptive, and electrolyte imbalances across epithelial cells and form anywhere within the renal tubular system. Recent research for inherited cystic renal disease suggests affected genes involve primary cilium of renal epithelial cells, a potential common pathway for these conditions.3 The term “ciliopathy” refers to this common pathway. The cilia function to modulate proliferation and differentiation of tubular cells, and their dysfunction may lead to inappropriate tubule expansion and cyst formation.4\n\nThis chapter will discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and treatment of various heritable and nonheritable cystic renal diseases, including ADPKD, autosomal recessive polycystic renal disease (ARPKD), isolated renal cysts, calyceal diverticuli, multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), medullary sponge kidney, nephronophthisis, multilocular cysts (multilocular cystic nephroma), acquired cystic kidney diseases, and syndromes associated with cystic kidney disease.\n\nAutosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease\n\nADPKD is relatively common, with an incidence of 1 in 400 to 1,000 live births manifesting as cystic dilation of the nephron and other extrarenal abnormalities, such as intracranial aneurysm.5 Severity varies per patient and tends to worsen over time, thus many pediatric patients and even some middle-aged adults can be asymptomatic. Although uncommon, severe disease in childhood may portend significant morbidity and mortality.6 Due to family history or incidental imaging findings, more asymptomatic children are being identified with ADPKD.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nOf those affected with ADPKD, about 96% will have clinical signs of the disease by the age of 90.7 Despite the majority of cases being discovered in middle-aged patients (30–40 years old) and rare renal failure before 40 years of age, it has been described as early as the newborn period. When described in newborns, ADPKD is felt to be more aggressive.8 Despite the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with theoretical 100% penetrance, 10% of cases may occur sporadically.1\n\nPathogenesis\n\nADPKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and the major genetic mutations occur in PKD1 and PKD2 on chromosome 16 and chromosome 4, respectively.5 The gene product is a transmembrane protein (polycystin 1 and polycystin 2, respectively) localized within primary cilia.9 PKD1 mutations on chromosome 16 account for the majority of cases and increased severity while most remaining cases are from PKD2 mutations.10\n\nImproper functioning of polycystin 1 or polycystin 2 leads to dysregulation of proliferative pathway signals such as cAMP, ERK, and mTOR. Cilia may play an organizational role in transduction of these signals, as dysregulation leads to cyst formation.11\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nAs a cost effective and minimally invasive imaging study, renal ultrasonography is frequently used for identifying ADPKD. Ultrasonographic diagnostic criteria in those younger than 30 include the presence of at least two unilateral or bilateral cysts, with more cysts needed to suggest diagnosis as age increases.12 However, ADPKD and ARPKD can be difficult to distinguish in the pediatric population, making the presence of positive family history crucial in a diagnosis.13 In the absence of family history, genetic testing can be performed. Other factors important to consider, when family history is negative, include bilateral renal enlargement, three or more hepatic cysts, cerebral artery aneurysm, and solitary cysts of other organs (arachnoid, pineal gland, pancreas, or spleen).1,14 Imaging or biopsy of the liver may also help differentiate ADPKD and ARPKD as hepatic fibrosis is always present in ARPKD, but rare in ADPKD.5 Finally, renal pathology (biopsy) may be helpful as ADPKD may involve the entirety of the tubule, including the glomerulus, however ARPKD would not have glomerular cysts.5\n\nTreatment Options, Outcomes, and Complications\n\nThere is currently no cure for ADPKD. Goals of treatment include delaying onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and reducing complication burden of ADPKD related to renal function decline, cardiac disease, and intracranial hemorrhage. Complications are most significantly modulated by managing hypertension.1 Therefore, rigorous control of blood pressure is recommended and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers are a common choice, however there is no consensus on ideal antihypertensives.15,16\n\nEmerging therapies under investigation aim to limit cyst growth by reducing cAMP using mTOR inhibitors, somatostatin, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Src kinase inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.\n\nAutosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease\n\nARPKD is characterized by rapid enlargement of both kidneys in infants due to the formation of cysts within the collecting duct system. It may be associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis which can lead to portal hypertension. An earlier presentation of ARPKD is often associated with increased severity.1 Its multisystem effects may necessitate multidisciplinary management.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nAs ARPKD is less common than ADPKD, there is less epidemiological data. Reported incidence is 1 in 26,500 live births but may range as much as 1 in 10,000 to 50,000 live births.1,17 However, it may be more common in isolated or consanguineous populations.\n\nPathogenesis\n\nARPKD is inherited in a classically autosomal recessive pattern, with unaffected heterozygote parents having a 25% risk of having an affected child. It is caused by mutation of chromosome 6 in the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene which encodes fibrocystin (also known as polyductin), a protein identified in the renal tubule system (collecting duct and thick ascending limb), epithelial cells of hepatic bile duct, and in primary apical cilia.5,18,19\n\nA typical patient may present in the neonatal period with a history of prenatal oligohydramnios, enlarged kidneys, and “Potter” sequence with pulmonary hypoplasia and perinatal death in approximately 30% of affected newborns.20,21 Enlarged kidneys appear echogenic with fusiform collecting duct dilation and progression to ESRD may occur at varying ages. Effect on other organ systems may manifest as dilated biliary ducts, congenital hepatic fibrosis, portal hypertension, and neurocognitive dysfunction.22\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nFetal and newborn ultrasound may show bilateral, very enlarged, and diffusely echogenic kidneys due to abundant microcysts.1 The presence of macrocysts (&gt; 10 mm) may indicate other ciliopathies such as MCDK or ADPKD and MRI may help further evaluate anomalies in the setting of severe oligohydramnios.13 Accurate diagnosis depends on suggestive imaging findings, presence of family history with recessive mode of inheritance, liver biopsy showing periportal lesions (present in ARPKD and rare in ADPKD), and lack of extrarenal manifestations associated with other cystic renal diseases.1\n\nTreatment Options, Outcomes, and Complications\n\nSimilar to ADPKD, there is no cure for ARPKD, thus many treatment options are for symptom management or palliation related to hypertension, congestive heart failure, and renal and hepatic failure. Aggressive treatment, such as unilateral or bilateral nephrectomy, may be indicated in severely affected individuals who suffer respiratory or nutritional compromise due to mass effect from enlarged kidneys. Decompressive therapies may be implemented for management of portal hypertension. Hemodialysis and renal transplantation are often considered.1\n\nIsolated Renal Cysts\n\nSolitary and multiple renal cysts are the most common lesions of the adult and elderly kidney, yet rare in children and infants.4 They have been identified prenatally, although prenatal lesions commonly resolve during pregnancy.23\n\nEpidemiology\n\nPrenatal ultrasound has shown prevalence of renal cysts to be 0.09%.23 Incidence of simple cysts from birth to 18 years of age averages at 0.22% with a range of 0.1% to 0.45%.24 Incidence rises in adults and advancing age.\n\nPathogenesis\n\nThere is much variety in size, however most remain less than 2 cm and are often cortical, disrupting renal contour, but may also be deep cortical or seemingly medullary, but without continuity with the renal pelvis.1 They typically do not impair renal function, but may occasionally cause pain when the cyst compresses adjacent structures or obstructs the collecting system.5\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nIdentification is typically incidental and diagnosis can be safely made by ultrasound when meeting the following criteria: 1) internally anechoic cyst, 2) thin, sharply-defined wall with distinct margins, 3) adequate transmission of ultrasound waves with enhancement behind cyst, 4) spherical or ovoid in shape.1 If these criteria are not met or when ultrasound does not provide satisfactory evaluation, as in the case of more complex cysts, CT scan may provide more anatomic detail. Alternatively, MRI or needle aspiration may be indicated.25\n\nSimple cysts do not communicate with the renal pelvis, however some cysts may appear in close proximity. Concern for communication can be evaluated by cross-sectional imaging with IV contrast with delayed phase, such as CT urogram or MR urogram. Additionally, cyst aspiration and lab testing can help identify renal pelvis communication. If noncontiguous, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine will be comparable to the patients values.5,26,27 A single cyst may also raise concern for ADPKD in the setting of positive family history.28 Historically the Bosniak cyst classification has not been well validated in children, however one recent study concludes that a modified Bosniak classification system provides reasonable risk stratification and showed that lesions with mBosniak score 1 or 2 are often benign, while scores 3 or 4 proved to have 90% containing intermediate or malignant pathology.29\n\nTreatment Options and Their Outcomes\n\nSymptomatic cysts may be drained, however are likely to recur without the use of a sclerosing agent.5 Another management option includes surgical intervention with cyst decortication, which is amenable to a minimally invasive, laparoscopic approach, especially for cysts that are relatively superficial and/or exophytic.\n\nFollow up may consist of ultrasonographic imaging to monitor for signs suggestive of malignancy. Stable cysts that have not grown for two years may require no additional follow-up.29,30,31,32,33 Intervention may not be indicated after lesion has been proven to not be malignant.\n\nCalyceal Diverticuli\n\nCalyceal diverticuli (CD) are rare outpouchings of calyx into the renal parenchyma. They are classified into two groups: type 1 being more common and adjacent to an upper or lower calyx while type 2 are larger, communicate with the renal pelvis, and are more often symptomatic.34\n\nEpidemiology\n\nCD has been reported to be found in 0.2% to 0.6% of children who have had IV urograms performed.13\n\nPathogenesis\n\nThe pathogenesis of CD is largely unknown and is not considered a genetically inherited disease. However, theories do include gene mutations inducing syndromes that affect the kidney, or alternatively failure of ureteric bud regression or obstructive causes.13 The cyst is lined with transitional cell epithelium and communicates with the collecting system, typically through a calyx or narrowed or stenosed infundibulum and less often through the renal pelvis.35\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nPatients may be asymptomatic or rather present with hematuria, pain, UTI, or nephrolithiasis; the most common presenting sign in children is febrile UTI.35 Asymptomatic diverticula are typically discovered on imaging studies. While ultrasound may initially identify the calyceal diverticulum, in order to distinguish between a simple cyst and a calyceal diverticulum, the most accurate imaging study is cross-sectional imaging with IV contrast and a delayed phase.35,36,37 Figure 1 and Figure 2 demonstrate findings consistent with CD on MR urography. A recent study comparing ultrasound to cross-sectional imaging found that focused renal US had a sensitivity of 40% and specificity of 100% respectively, while cross-sectional imaging (specifically static-fluid MR urography) had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91.6% respectively.37 Pain, infection, abscess formation, urosepsis, symptomatic renal calculi may all be possible indications for surgical management.\n\n\nFigure 1 MR Urogram showing contrast filling a calyceal diverticulum in the interpolar region of the left kidney with overlying thinning of the renal parenchyma.\n\n\nFigure 2 Sagittal view of MR urogram in same patient, showing contrast filling the calyceal diverticulum.\n\nTreatment Options, Their Outcomes, and Complications\n\nAsymptomatic patients do not require treatment, but may benefit from ultrasonographic monitoring.1 Those with indications for surgical management, as mentioned above, may benefit from laparoscopic marsupialization of diverticulum with fulguration of epithelial lining.38,39,40 Other possible management procedures may include ureteroscopy or minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (in setting of stones),41 ureteroscopic ablation of cavity,39 or percutaneous ablation and fulguration.42 Despite the array of treatment possibilities, surgical intervention to manage CD can be challenging. In an attempt to minimize morbidity, management typically begins with the less invasive options, such as endoscopic or percutaneous approaches. There can be a high rate of symptom recurrence,42 in which case intervention can escalate to laparoscopic/robotic approaches and even open approaches, up to and including partial nephrectomy or total nephrectomy. Therefore, extensive counseling of patients is necessary when considering surgical intervention for CD.\n\nMulticystic Dysplastic Kidney\n\nMulticystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a congenital malformation commonly diagnosed during childhood or by prenatal ultrasonography characterized by many unilateral noncommunicating cysts and abnormal metanephric differentiation (presence of cartilage, undifferentiated mesenchyme, and immature collecting ductules) often in setting of obstructive uropathy.4,13,43 Bilateral disease is usually incompatible with life due to oligohydramnios or anhydramnios leading to pulmonary hypoplasia.44\n\nEpidemiology\n\nMCDK is one of the most common anomalies, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000 to 4,000 births.1,45 A higher incidence of solitary kidney in adulthood is likely associated with involution of MCDK over time given the low incidence of true renal agenesis.5\n\nPathogenesis\n\nMulticystic dysplasia arises before formation of the nephron, from abnormal metanephric differentiation, an abnormality of the nephrogenic blastema, or high-grade obstruction occurring during kidney development.1 Cysts are lined by low cuboidal epithelium surrounded by spindle cells and may be filled with proteinaceous or sanguineous fluid.1 Primitive and dysplastic components as well as immature cartilage or immature glomeruli can be seen. MCDK is classified as infundibulopelvic type with atresia of renal pelvis and ureter versus the less common hydronephrotic type that only involves atresia of upper ureter.46 The contralateral kidney may show compensatory hypertrophy.\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nCurrently, MCDK is discovered on prenatal US most commonly, whereas evaluation of a palpable mass in a neonate is the next most common presentation.47\n\nA diagnosis of MCDK must be differentiated from hydronephrosis due to other conditions like UPJ obstruction. Notably, in MCDK, cysts are noncommunicating and larger cysts appear laterally. In hydronephrosis, renal parenchyma surrounds the central cystic structure and the typical reniform shape is maintained.48 Figure 3 and Figure 4 help demonstrate the challenges of differentiating MCDK from hydronephrosis on ultrasound. Figure 5 illustrates noncommunicating cysts of various sizes, typical of MCDK. To further clarify, a radionuclide scan can be performed which would show uptake with hydronephrosis and typically minimal or no uptake in the setting of MCDK.49\n\n\nFigure 3 Renal ultrasound demonstrating what could be several renal cysts in an MCDK versus pelvicaliectasis/hydronephrosis (HDN).\n\n\nFigure 4 Another renal ultrasound image for this same patient, demonstrating continuity between pelvis and calyces, consistent with pelvicaliectasis/HDN.\n\n\nFigure 5 Renal ultrasound demonstrating multiple noncommunicating cysts of different sizes, consistent with MCDK.\n\nTreatment Options, Their Outcomes, and Complications\n\nThe natural history of MCDK involves involution over time with possible complications including hypertension and malignancy.5 However, the risk of the latter may be low.50 Historically, affected kidneys were surgically removed out of concern for rare cases of malignant degeneration, but there has been a shift toward non-operative care with monitoring ultrasonography of both kidneys. Indications for surgery include changes suspicious for development of Wilms’ tumor, mass effect, pain, hypertension, and parental preference.5 Patients with MCDK and a normal contralateral kidney should be reassured of anticipated long-term normal renal function, barring injury to their contralateral kidney. They should also be counseled on the importance of preventive maintenance measures, like using protective gear when engaging in sports, and healthy lifestyle choices (diet and exercise) to mitigate other causes of renal disease (like hypertension and diabetes). To characterize risk of chronic kidney disease development, surveillance can additionally include contralateral kidney imagining, voiding cystourethrogram to screen for VUR, blood pressure monitoring, and urinalysis for proteinuria.51\n\nMedullary Sponge Kidney\n\nMedullary sponge kidney (MSK) is characterized by distal collecting duct dilation, cysts, and diverticula all restricted to the medullary pyramids.1\n\nEpidemiology\n\nMSK is primarily found in young adulthood, but may also present in children.52 As many individuals with MSK are asymptomatic, the incidence is not clearly defined. It is more common in people with a calcium stone history and has been associated with congenital syndromes, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, anodontia, and Caroli disease.1\n\nPathogenesis\n\nMSK is largely considered nonhereditary, however, there have been cases that seem to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion supporting a hypothesis that MSK disrupts the ureteric bud and metanephric blastema interface.52\n\nDilated intrapapillary collecting duct and medullary cysts contain calcified or desquamated material, give the kidney a sponge-like appearance, and are bilateral in 70% of cases.1 Cysts are contiguous with collecting tubules and lined by collecting duct epithelium.53\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis may be based on urographic features of enlarged kidneys with occasional calcification especially at the papillae, enlarged papillary tubules that fill with contrast, and papillary contrast blush with residual medullary opacification.54 Liver evaluation can clarify between MSK and ADPKD, if diagnosis is unclear.1\n\nTreatment Options, Their Outcomes, and Complications\n\nManagement is primarily dictated by stone or infection treatment. Stone prevention is followed, including increased fluid intake, low sodium diet, thiazides, and potassium citrate.52 Complications associated with MSK are related to the increased incidence of nephrolithiasis and its associated morbidity.\n\nNephronophthisis\n\nNephronophthisis (NPHP) is a recessively inherited common cause of chronic kidney disease in children, often paired with medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD) as they have similar radiographic and histologic appearance; however MCKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, has delayed presentation (adulthood), and lacks extrarenal involvement.5\n\nEpidemiology\n\nNPHP is classified as infantile (1 year of age), juvenile (13 years of age), or adolescent (19 years of age) based on the genetic defect present. Infantile NPHP leads to ESRD by 1–3 years of age and is associated with NPHP2 mutations (also referred to as NPHP type 2). Juvenile NPHP, the most common manifestation, leads to ESRD at 10–13 years and is most often associated with NPHP1 mutation (also referred to as NPHP type 1). Lastly, adolescent NPHP is associated with NPHP3 mutations (also referred to as NPHP type 3).5,55\n\nPathogenesis\n\nAlthough it can occur sporadically, NPHP is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion with homozygous deleterious mutations of NPHP1 on chromosome 2 as the most common cause.56 There are many genes known to be associated with NPHP (see (Table 2)5\n\nTable 2 Genetic heterogeneity of NPHP.5\n\n\n  \n    \n      Type\n      Chromosome location\n      Gene mutated\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      NPH type 1\n      2q13\n      NPHP1\n    \n    \n      NPH type 2\n      9q22\n      NPHP2\n    \n    \n      NPH type 3\n      3q22\n      NPHP3\n    \n    \n      NPH type 4\n      1p36\n      NPHP4\n    \n    \n      NPH type 5\n      3q21\n      NPHP5\n    \n    \n      PH type 6\n      12q21\n      NPHP6\n    \n    \n      NPH type 7\n      16p\n      NPHP7\n    \n    \n      NPH type 8\n      16q\n      NPHP8\n    \n    \n      NPH type 9\n      17q11\n      NPHP9\n    \n    \n      NPH type 10\n      1q44\n      SDCCAG8\n    \n    \n      PH type 11\n      8q22\n      MKS3\n    \n    \n      AHI1\n      6q23\n      AHI1\n    \n  \n\n\nGross evaluation of NPHP kidneys may vary based on type but tend to be small in size with a granular surface. Histologically, they display interstitial fibrosis and mononuclear cell infiltration, variable tubule changes including atrophy, thickening, and lamination of basement membranes.57 Cysts in NPHP arise from distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts.57\n\nEvaluation, Diagnosis, and Complications\n\nProblems with urine concentrating ability may lead to polyuria and polydipsia (dehydration, nocturia) with resultant renal sodium wasting; symptoms of CKD such as fatigue, anorexia, growth retardation; as well as symptoms of renal osteodystrophy. Anemia may be present out of proportion to renal failure. HTN is less common except in type 2 NPHP.5,58 Extrarenal involvement includes hepatic and portal fibrosis with hepatomegaly as well as many others: Senior-Løken syndrome (NPHP and tapetoretinal degeneration), skeletal abnormalities, mental retardation, cerebellar ataxia, situs inversus, cardiac malformation, or other less common syndromes.5\n\nUltrasonography is a common method for identification, but may not detect all cases; thin-section computed tomography (CT) may capture such cases.58 Genetic testing is available for diagnosis as well as renal histology when imaging is inconclusive. Liver and ocular screening is recommended for hepatic fibrosis and Senior-Løken syndrome.5\n\nTreatment Options and Their Outcomes\n\nThere are few effective treatments available for NPHP. Current management includes supportive and preventive management for CKD. Transplantation in setting of kidney failure is preferred, as tubular injury does not occur in the donor kidney.13\n\nMultilocular Cysts\n\nMultilocular cysts (cystic nephroma) is a benign neoplastic growth occurring in adults and children that exists on a spectrum with Wilms’ tumor.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe majority of cases occur before 4 years of age or after 30 years of age, with a male predominance in the pediatric population.59\n\nPathogenesis\n\nLesions are bulky, non-communicating, well encapsulated by fibrous tissue, may contain embryonic tissue, and may compress normal renal parenchyma.5\n\nEvaluation, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\nMultilocular cysts in children most commonly present with a palpable abdominal mass.60 Evaluation is performed with ultrasound or CT scan, however, due to the difficulty in sometimes discerning between multilocular cysts and cystic Wilms’ tumor based purely upon imaging, ultimate diagnosis may be made via histopathologic examination following nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy.60\n\nAcquired Cystic Kidney Diseases\n\nAcquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) describes the bilateral cystic changes of the kidney in the setting of ESRD and azotemia and not inherited renal cystic disease.1\n\nEpidemiology\n\nCysts are found in 10% of patients with ESRD, increasing to 44% and 60% at 3 and 5 years after initiation of dialysis.1\n\nPathogenesis\n\nEtiology is thought to be toxin mediated, accumulation of growth factors, or tubular obstruction due to fibrosis, oxalate crystals, vascular occlusion or ischemia.1 Kidneys are bilaterally affected and usually smaller in size than normal, while histology shows flat to cuboidal epithelium similar to distal tubular epithelium.4\n\nEvaluation, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Complications\n\nMost patients with cysts are asymptomatic but may present with pain and/or hematuria due to spontaneous bleeding into cysts. Ultrasonography is commonly used for diagnosis and monitoring while CT or MRI may more readily identify cysts, however in ESRD patients imaging with IV contrast should be carefully managed due to the nephrotoxic effects of contrast agents.1 The main complications are hemorrhage and neoplastic transformation.4 Surveillance ultrasonography is recommended with nephrectomy in a setting suspicious for neoplasia.5 Thus treatment is managed conservatively with symptom management and modulation of screening schedules or dialysis regimens.\n\nSyndromes Associated with Cystic Kidney Disease\n\nRenal cysts can be seen in various syndromes, the most common of which may include autosomal dominant tuberous sclerosis and Von Hippel-Lindau. Others of autosomal recessive inheritance patterns include Meckel syndrome, Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, and Zellweger cerebrohepatorenal syndrome.1\n\nTuberous Sclerosis\n\nTuberous sclerosis is diagnosed by presence of either two major criteria or one major plus two minor criteria (see Table 3).61 Multiple renal cysts is included as a minor criteria.61,62 Renal involvement is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tuberous sclerosis.63\n\nTable 3 Major and minor criteria for tuberous sclerosis complex.61\n\n\n  \n    \n      Major Criteria\n      Minor Criteria\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Hypomelanotic macules (≥3, at least 5-mm diameter)\n      “Confetti” skin lesions\n    \n    \n      Angiofibromas (≥3) or fibrous cephalic plaque\n      Dental enamel pits (&gt;3)\n    \n    \n      Ungual fibromas (≥2)\n      Intraoral fibromas (≥2)\n    \n    \n      Shagreen patch\n      Retinal achromic patch\n    \n    \n      Multiple retinal hamartomas\n      Multiple renal cysts\n    \n    \n      Cortical dysplasias\n      Nonrenal hamartomas\n    \n    \n      Subependymal nodules\n       \n    \n    \n      Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma\n       \n    \n    \n      Cardiac rhabdomyoma\n       \n    \n    \n      Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)\n       \n    \n    \n      Angiomyolipomas (≥2)\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nVon Hippel-Lindau Syndrome\n\nVon Hippel-Lindau syndrome similarly has many manifestations, of which renal cell carcinoma and renal cysts are common, but infrequently seen in children.64\n\nMeckel syndrome\n\nThis may present with a variety of manifestations including cysts. Cystic dysplasia is always present.5,65\n\nConclusions\n\nFluid-filled renal cysts are found in a large, heterogenous group of renal cystic diseases. Although they share a common manifestation as renal cysts, this group of diseases are differentiated by many factors: pattern of inheritance, age of onset, associated renal or extrarenal abnormalities, clinical course, histological differences, appearance on imaging, among others. Accurate identification of a disease process may be challenging with overlapping symptomatology. Imagining techniques, especially ultrasonography, has long been a primary mode of identifying many of these diseases. Genetic testing options are becoming more common and accessible.\n\nContinued research leads to basic science and clinical advancements, helping to identify new diseases, pathophysiology, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Distinction between a simple cyst and a calyceal diverticulum may be difficult, however of particular importance as a calyceal diverticulum is much more likely to cause symptoms and require intervention. Diagnosis can be facilitated using cross-sectional imaging with IV contrast and delayed phase images.\n  It is also of importance to distinguish between MCDK and severe hydronephrosis, as in the setting of ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction. The management of MCDK is largely observational whereas there is a higher likelihood that intervention may be necessary for hydronephrosis or UPJ obstruction. Diagnosis can be facilitated using radionuclide imaging.\n  Management of certain cystic kidney diseases, such as ADPKD and ARPKD, should be done in partnership with nephrology to facilitate optimal medical-renal care.\n  Characterization of cysts by prenatal imaging often help differentiate between possible diseases (see Figure 6 below).13\n\n\n\nFigure 6 Differentiation of cysts by prenatal imaging.13\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n  Pope JC.

        "title": "Hydronephrosis and Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction",
        "content": "By Ahmed M. Atwa &amp; Ashraf T. Hafez\nUrology and Nephrology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt\n\nIntroduction\n\nHydronephrosis is defined as aseptic dilatation of the renal pelvis with or without the calyces. If it occurs before birth, this is called antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH). The presence of infected hydronephrosis denotes pyonephrosis while the presence of dilated ureter with the dilated renal pelvis is called hydroureteronephrosis (HUN).\n\nThe significance of ANH is attributed to being the most commonly encountered fetal urinary tract anomaly detected by ultrasonography.1 The majority of ANH is temporary and resolves spontaneously. The other pathological causes of ANH may be obstructive or non-obstructive. Obstructive causes can occur at any part of the urinary tract, but the most common pathology is ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). Non-obstructive etiologies comprise vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), non-obstructing non-refluxing megaureter, Prune-Belly syndrome, etc.\n\nMany tools are used by pediatric urologists to measure the severity of ANH. The North American school relies mainly on the Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) grading system while measuring the APRPD is preferred in Europe.2\n\nUPJO is defined as impairment of urine flow from the renal pelvis to the ureter with subsequent dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system. The presence of dilated renal pelvis with a non-dilated ureter by RBUS raises the suspicion of UPJO.\n\nThis chapter will address the embryology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, evaluation, treatment options, follow-up, and complications of ANH and UPJO. The remaining causes of ANH will be covered in other chapters.\n\nEmbryology\n\nThe kidneys develop from three overlapping sequential structures; the pronephros, the mesonephros, and the metanephros which are all derived from a region in the intermediate mesoderm known as the urogenital ridge.3 In the fourth week of gestation, the pronephros arises at the cervical region. Then, segmented parts of the intermediate mesoderm connect to form the pronephric duct which extends from the cervical region to the distal end of the embryo (cloaca). The pronephros is non-functional and regresses entirely by the end of the fourth gestational week.\n\nAfter that, the mesonephros emerges caudal to the pronephros and pronephric duct persistence induces the formation of mesonephric tubules from the intermediate mesoderm which open into the pronephric duct forming the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct. The ureteric bud arises from the posterior aspect of the mesonephric duct.\n\nThe metanephros arises in the fifth week of development. After that, the ureteric bud joins the metanephric cap. The ureteric bud gives rise to the mucosa of the ureter, the renal pelvis, major and minor calyces, and collecting ducts. The mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric bud forms the lamina propria, the musculosa, and the adventitia of the ureter and renal pelvis. The proper development of the ureter and renal pelvis is dependent on reciprocal signaling between their mesenchymal and epithelial components. Abnormal signaling results in improper development and branching of the ureteric bud.Complete ureteral duplication results from the development of two ureteric buds on the same side while incomplete ureteral duplication arises from early bifurcation of the ureteric bud. In case of late bifurcation of the ureteric bud, a bifid renal pelvis is formed. Weigert-Meyer law describes the relationship between the two ureters in complete ureteral duplication. The upper moiety ureter is inserted into the bladder inferomedially, and it is the site of obstruction by a ureterocele or an ectopic ureter. On the other hand, the lower moiety ureter is inserted superolaterally into the bladder rendering it liable to VUR because of the short intramural tunnel. In addition, it can be affected by UPJO.\n\nEventually, ureteral canalization and ureteral wall maturation take place at the end of embryogenesis. Nonetheless, the latter continues beyond birth and this may elucidate the spontaneous resolution of many cases diagnosed with ANH. The fetal kidney starts to produce urine between the fifth and ninth weeks of gestation. Urine represents around 90% of the amniotic fluid which in turn is responsible for expansion of lung alveoli. Therefore, oligohydramnios is associated with pulmonary hypoplasia which is presented clinically as respiratory distress. The urogenital sinus gives rise to the bladder and urethra between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nANH is the most common anomaly of the urinary tract detected by fetal ultrasonography. It affects one to five percent of all pregnancies. Fortunately, up to 80% of cases are temporary and resolve spontaneously. UPJO is the most common cause of pathological ANH and is typically treated by surgical intervention. It affects boys two times more than girls and the left side is involved more than the right one by two times. UPJO can affect both kidneys in 10% to 30% of cases.\n\nUPJO is usually sporadic, but six cases with familial history were reported in the literature.4 UPJO can occur with other urological anomalies (e.g., VUR, multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), horseshoe kidney, or duplicated kidney where the lower moiety is most commonly the site affected).\n\nEtiology/Pathogenesis\n\nThe majority of ANH is temporary and improves spontaneously with time. Pathological causes that do not resolve postnatally can be due to obstructive or non-obstructive causes. Obstructive causes include; UPJO, obstructing megaureter, ureterocele, ectopic ureter, posterior urethral valve (PUV), urethral atresia in addition to neuropathic bladder. Non-obstructive etiologies comprise; VUR, non-obstructing non-refluxing megaureter, Prune-Belly syndrome.\n\nObstruction is accompanied by reduced renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and potassium excretion, according to Josephson et al., and only a tiny percentage of this damage is mitigated by early intervention.5\n\nCauses of UPJO\n\nPrimary UPJO can be caused by intrinsic, extrinsic, or intraluminal causes.6 Intrinsic obstruction is due to aperistaltic segment resulting from abnormal musculature or neurological development. This results in inappropriate urine flow from the renal pelvis to the ureter. Other causes of intrinsic obstruction comprise stenotic segment caused by excessive collagen deposition and congenital ureteral folds.\n\nExtrinsic obstruction is caused by an aberrant crossing vessel that passes in front of the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ). This type of obstruction is usually intermittent and presented later at the age of seven years or above. Intraluminal obstruction is owing to a fibroepithelial polyp. This pathology affects anywhere in the urinary tract starting from the UPJ, till the urethra.7 Secondary UPJO is due to previous surgery, VUR, impacted stone, and post-inflammatory stricture.\n\nUPJO-associated anomalies include; contralateral UPJO (10-30%), contralateral renal dysplasia, contralateral MCDK, unilateral renal agenesis (5%), duplicated collecting system where UPJO usually occurs in the lower moiety, horseshoe kidney, ectopic kidney, VUR (20-40%) and VACTERL syndrome.8,9\n\nTo avoid progressive intrapelvic pressure rise, the renal pelvis dilates to accommodate it preventing renal damage. Nevertheless, prolonged obstruction with failure of the compensatory mechanisms and loss of compliance result in increasing intrarenal pressure with subsequent renal damage. The earlier the obstruction during fetal life, the more renal damage is expected. Dietl’s crisis is an intermittent abdominal pain arising from distension of the pelvicalyceal system, and it is usually caused by a crossing vessel causing UPJO in children above five years.10\n\nEvaluation and diagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis of ANH is based on measuring the APRPD which is five mm or more in the second trimester and seven mm or more in the third one.11 Fetal RBUS interpretation involves the following items; fetal sex, amniotic fluid index (AFI), gestational age, associated congenital anomalies, unilateral or bilateral hydronephrosis, degree of hydronephrosis, APRPD, parenchymal status in the form of parenchymal thickness and echogenicity, ureteral dilatation, bladder fullness and cycling in addition to its wall thickness, and urethral dilatation (Table 1)\n\nTable 1 The ten questions to be addressed for the evaluation of antenatal hydronephrosis.\n\n\n  \n    \n      10 Questions\n      Question\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 question related to the amniotic fluid\n      Amniotic fluid index (AFI)\n    \n    \n      3 questions related to the fetus\n      Male or female\n    \n    \n       \n      Gestational age\n    \n    \n       \n      Other congenital anomalies\n    \n    \n      3 questions related to the kidney\n      Grade and laterality of hydronephrosis\n    \n    \n       \n      Dilatation of the upper ureter\n    \n    \n       \n      Renal Parenchyma (Parenchymal thickness and echogenicity)\n    \n    \n      3 questions related to the rest of the urinary tract\n      Dilatation of the lower ureter\n    \n    \n       \n      Bladder (Bladder fullness and bladder wall thickness)\n    \n    \n       \n      Posterior urethral dilatation\n    \n  \n\n\nA full bladder wall thickness of more than two mm denotes thickened bladder wall regardless of the gestational age.12 The inability to visualize the bladder on several occasions is a sign of bladder exstrophy. In PUV, a full bladder with dilated posterior urethra can be seen giving a “keyhole sign”.\n\nIn the second trimester, ANH is classified into mild, moderate, and severe when the APRPD equals four to six mm, seven to ten mm, and more than ten mm, respectively. In the third trimester, prenatal hydronephrosis is classified into the same previous grades when the APRPD measures seven to nine mm, ten to 15 mm, and more than 15 mm, respectively (Table 2).11\n\nTable 2 Antenatal hydronephrosis categories.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Degree\n      2nd trimester\n      3rd trimester\n      % of ANH\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      mild\n      4-7 mm\n      7-9 mm\n      56-88%\n    \n    \n      moderate\n      7-10 mm\n      9-15 mm\n      10-30%\n    \n    \n      severe\n      &gt;10 mm\n      &gt;15 mm\n      2-13%\n    \n  \n\n\nThe baby should be re-evaluated three to seven days after birth and not earlier to avoid false-negative results caused by transient oliguria of the newborn, especially in the first 48 hours of life. Nevertheless, RBUS is done immediately following labor in cases of bilateral high-grade hydronephrosis, solitary kidney, oligohydramnios, or when PUV is suspected.\n\nIn North America, the SFU grading system is used for classifying hydronephrosis while the APRPD is used in Europe. The SFU classification of hydronephrosis is depicted in (Table 3)13\n\nTable 3 SFU grading system.\n\n\n  \n    \n      SFU Grade\n      Descriptors\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Grade 0\n      no dilatation, calyceal walls are opposed to each other\n    \n    \n      Grade 1 (mild)\n      dilatation of the renal pelvis without dilatation of the calyces (can also occur in the extrarenal pelvis)\n    \n    \n       \n      no parenchymal atrophy\n    \n    \n      Grade 2 (mild)\n      dilatation of the renal pelvis (mild) and calyces (pelvicalyceal pattern is retained)\n    \n    \n       \n      no parenchymal atrophy\n    \n    \n      Grade 3 (moderate)\n      moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces\n    \n    \n       \n      blunting of fornices and flattening of papillae\n    \n    \n       \n      mild cortical thinning may be seen\n    \n    \n      Grade 4 (severe)\n      gross dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces, which appear ballooned\n    \n    \n       \n      loss of borders between the renal pelvis and calyces\n    \n    \n       \n      renal atrophy seen as cortical thinning\n    \n  \n\n\nThe disadvantage of the SFU grading system is that being a little bit subjective without using the APRPD measurements resulting in its difficult correlation with ANH measurements. Based on the APRPD, hydronephrosis is graded into mild, moderate, and marked in which the APRPD measures 7-10 mm, 10-15 mm, and above 15 mm, respectively.14 The demerit of this classification is depending on only one item to grade hydronephrosis and neglecting the other parameters, such as parenchymal thickness and peripheral calyceal dilatation.\n\nTherefore, a new classification of hydronephrosis has been proposed to avoid the cons of the previous two grading systems. The urinary tract dilatation (UTD) classification system relies on six RBUS findings; APRPD, calyceal dilation with the distinction between central and peripheral calyceal dilation postnatally, renal parenchymal thickness, renal parenchymal appearance, bladder abnormalities, and ureteral abnormalities. This grading system differentiates whether the RBUS findings were antenatal (normal, A1, A2, A3) or postnatal (normal, P1, P2, P3).15\n\nIf RBUS is unremarkable, it should be repeated after four to six weeks. In case of SFU grade 0 with APRPD of less than seven mm as a result of RBUS performed at the fourth to the sixth week, further follow-up is not needed. The effect of hydronephrosis grade on resolution rate was studied by.16\n\nIf postnatal hydronephrosis is detected with the presence of ureteral dilatation or suspicion of an abnormal bladder, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) should be requested to exclude VUR, PUV in boys (Figure 1), neuropathic or non-neuropathic bladder dysfunction.\n\n\nFigure 1 Voiding cystourethrogram depicting the classic appearance of posterior urethral valve.\n\nIn the presence of SFU grade 1 to 2 postnatal hydronephrosis or APRPD of less than 15 mm without ureteral dilatation or abnormal bladder in an asymptomatic infant, RBUS should be done every three to six months, and then every six to twelve months.17 Spontaneous resolution of hydronephrosis is usually expected in the first two years of life.\n\nOn the other hand, SFU grade 3 to 4 hydronephrosis or APRPD of 15 mm or more designates closer follow-up. In such a situation, VCUG is needed to exclude VUR, PUV, or bladder pathology. If VCUG is unremarkable, a dynamic renogram, especially MAG3 is advocated to have an idea about the split renal function and the presence of obstruction.\n\nUPJO presents either prenatally or after birth. When it comes to the prenatal period, UPJO is the most common cause of pathological ANH 18. Postnatally, the patient can be asymptomatic with incidentally discovered hydronephrosis or may present with high-grade fever because of obstructed infected kidney or loin pain in older children. In children above five years with intermittent obstruction, aberrant crossing vessel should be suspected. \n\nHematuria is an uncommon presentation and usually follows flank trauma because the hydronephrotic kidney is more liable to trauma than the normal one. Palpable flank mass is rarely encountered in the era of ultrasonography.\n\nRBUS alone can provide provisional diagnosis of the underlying pathology causing ANH. Dilated renal pelvis with non-dilated ureter signifies UPJO (Figure 2) while dilated ureter may be due to VUR or megaureter. In MCDK, the renal cysts are not connected to each other and the renal parenchymal is not preserved whereas the renal cysts are usually bilateral and communicable with preserved renal parenchyma. Ureterocele appears as a cyst within a cyst (the bladder), and it is associated with the upper pole of duplicated renal systems in 80% of cases while the remaining 20% are single-system ureteroceles which need puncture for system decompression. The key-hole appearance of dilated bladder and posterior urethra in boys is diagnostic of PUV. \n\n\nFigure 2 Renal and bladder ultrasound showing left UPJO\n\nThe role of renal scintigraphy cannot be neglected. Three types of renal scintigraphy are used, mercapto-acetyl triglycine (MAG3), di-ethylene tri-amene penta-acetic acid (DTPA), and dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA).18 All of them are labeled with metastable technetium-99 (99mTc). MAG3 undergoes both tubular and glomerular excretion. DTPA is only filtered by glomeruli, that is why it should not be requested in case of renal insufficiency. DMSA binds only to the proximal renal tubules. The half-life (t1/2) of 99mTc is six hours. Many North American centers have limited availability to the DMSA agent, limiting ability to perform this type of nuclear medicine study.\n\nMAG3 and DTPA are dynamic, functional studies as opposed to DMSA. They provide information about the split renal function, and the presence of obstruction by taking serial images over time looking at uptake, excretion and drainage. However, MAG3 is preferred in children. DMSA is a static scan that can detect not only the split function but also the presence of renal scarring. Renography is done from the fourth to the sixth week to make sure that renal maturation has been reached.19\n\nIf renal scintigraphy is done before renal maturation, the scan may depict high residual cortical activity, retaining up to 50% or more of the peak. MAG3 or DTPA are requested when UPJO or UVJ are suspected whereas DMSA may done in cases of VUR as part of a top-down approach (Figure 3) Renograms have three phases. The first one is the vascular phase which reflects renal blood flow and takes up to ten seconds. The second one is the parenchymal phase which represents the renal uptake and occurs from the tenth second to the fifth minute following isotope injection. Eventually, the excretory phase follows representing radio-isotope excretion into the renal pelvis.\n\n\nFigure 3 DMSA scan depicting reduced radio-isotope uptake with renal scarring on the left side\n\nSome precautions are taken into consideration prior to renal scintigraphy e.g. adequate hydration or even intravenous infusion of normal saline at a rate of 10 mL/ kg with a maintenance of 4 mL/kg /hour and urethral catheter fixation for emptying the bladder to avoid false-positive results of obstruction. There is no consensus regarding the timing of diuretic injection. Routinely, it is injected 20 minutes following the radioactive isotope (F+20). To avoid pooling of the isotope in dilated pelvicalyceal systems, furosemide is recommended to be injected 15 minutes before the radioactive material (F-15). Other authors advocate injecting furosemide at the same time with a radioactive isotope (F+0). The dose of furosemide (Lasix) is 1 mg/kg in early infancy and 0.5 mg/ kg later on with a maximal dose of 40 mg.\n\nAlthough the differential function is the most significant variable in the renal scan, renography curves and t1/2 may indicate a provisional diagnosis of obstruction. O’Reilly described four curves for dynamic renogram; type I curve representing normal uptake and excretion (bell-shaped curve) (Figure 4), type II curve representing obstructed pattern with no response to diuretic (Figure 5) and Figure 6), type IIIa curve that initially rises then drops following diuretic injection, type IIIb curve that initially rises then neither drops nor continues to rise (equivocal), and type IV in which a delayed decompensation occurs 15 minutes following furosemide injection.20\n\n\nFigure 4 DTPA scan showing bell-shaped non-obstructed curve\n\n\nFigure 5 DTPA scan demonstrating obstructed curve of the left kidney\n\n\nFigure 6 DTPA scan showing obstructed curve of the right kidney with prolonged t1/2.\n\nT1/2 of less than 10 minutes is normal while t1/2 of more than 20 minutes signifies obstruction. Values in between are considered equivocal. However, many advocate against solely using the t1/2 value to determine whether there is obstruction, as the curve height, shape, patient fluid status, drainage of the bladder, and overall kidney function can influence this value.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis of UPJO, RBUS is done followed by renal scintigraphy to provide both structural and functional information (Figure 7) In debatable cases, magnetic resonance urography (MRU) may be requested. VCUG is not needed as long as the ureter is not dilated while intravenous urography is obsolete in modern pediatric urology.\n\n\nFigure 7 DTPA scan showing delayed drainge of the left kidney caused by left UPJO\n\nBy means of RBUS, dilated renal pelvis with non-dilated ureter is noted. As mentioned before, the APRPD should be measured and if it is more than 30 mm, renal scintigraphy should be requested because the incidence of renal function deterioration is high at this degree of hydronephrosis.\n\nThe use of duplex ultrasonography to suggestion obstruction cannot be neglected, although the accuracy of these findings may not be super high. The presence of ureteral jets from the ureter to the bladder excludes ureteral obstruction. Resistive index (RI) of 0.7 or more denotes obstruction. It is measured by subtracting the end-diastolic velocity (EDV) of the renal artery from its peak-systolic velocity (PSV) and the result is divided by the PSV. The rationale beyond the use of RI is that obstructive uropathy is ultimately accompanied by diminished renal blood flow. VCUG is not requested in the context of UPJO unless there is dilated lower end of the ureter in cases of UPJO secondary to VUR.\n\nAlthough contrast-enhanced computed tomography is generally avoided in children because of hazardous ionizing radiation, it may be used to detect the presence of a crossing vessel in the arterial (cortico-medullary) phase. Intravenous urography (IVU) is no longer recommended in modern pediatric urology. All contrast studies should be avoided unless the renal function tests are within the normal values.\n\nMRI can be done in equivocal cases in which RBUS is not conclusive. Dynamic MRI with gadolinium has gained attention in the last few years because of its ability to give information not only about the anatomical diagnosis but also regarding the function. It can assess the split renal function by measuring the volume of enhancing parenchyma using a special software by a radiation physicist to perform this calculation. Furthermore, calculation of the renal transit time, which is the time difference between cortical enhancement and ureter appearance, can be used to confirm obstruction.\n\nRetrograde uretero-pyelography may be used pre-operatively to confirm the diagnosis in doubtful cases or if the surgeon is planning for dorsal lumbotomy to exclude concomitant ureteral stricture. Last but not least, some biochemical markers have been used to detect renal tubular damage owing to obstruction e.g. β2-microglobulin, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1).\n\nTreatment options and their outcomes\n\nPrenatal management of ANH\n\nPrenatal intervention is rarely needed nowadays and it only considered in those with severe lower urinary tract obstruction e.g. bilateral high-grade hydronephrosis with oligohydramnios.21 In absence of life-threatening conditions after the 20th week of gestation, the pregnancy should not be terminated, nor should delivery plans be influenced (e.g., early induction of labor).\n\nPostnatal management of ANH\n\nPhysical examination cannot be neglected in cases diagnosed with ANH. For instance; abdominal mass may be felt in UPJO or MCDK while undescended testis and deficient anterior abdominal wall musculature are found in Prune- Belly syndrome in addition to palpable bladder in PUV.\n\nContinuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) is recommended in SFU grade 3 and 4 hydronephrosis or APRPD of 15 mm or more to reduce the rate of UTIs in the first two years of life.17 However, there are numerous studies of ANH (in the absence of reflux or megaureter/hydroureter) that show no benefit for CAP in patients with isolated high-grade hydronephrosis (grade 3-4).22\n\nCAP in the first two months comprises amoxicillin and trimethoprim at a dose of 10 to 20 mg/kg once daily and 2 mg/kg once daily, respectively. After that age, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) are prescribed at a dose of mg/ kg/ day. Early prescription of nitrofurantoin can cause hemolytic anemia or respiratory distress syndrome while sulfamethoxazole in the first two months causes kernicterus.\n\nCommon side effects of nitrofurantoin include gastrointestinal disturbance and skin reactions. Adverse events associated with TMP/SMX are mainly due to the sulfamethoxazole component, most commonly skin reactions. Antibiotic exposure during the first year of life is associated with an increased risk of developing atopic diseases, including eczema, asthma, and allergy later on.23 This finding is attributed to the hygiene hypothesis, which proposes that growing up in an extremely hygienic environment with minimal microbial exposure may increase atopic immune responses. Another demerit of CAP is development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe main challenge for pediatric urologists is to distinguish UPJO that is going to resolve spontaneously from that will cause renal function deterioration. The former needs follow-up whereas the latter requires intervention.\n\nIndications of definitive intervention include the presence of symptoms (pain, febrile UTI), palpable kidney, and APRPD of more than 40 mm.24 Other indications comprise; progressive hydronephrosis during follow-up, split renal function less than 40% and deterioration of split function by 10% or more.25 In cases of symptomatic neglected UPJO with a split renal function of less than 10%, nephrectomy is advocated. However, some pediatric urologists prefer early drainage by nephrostomy tube or internal ureteral stent and then re-evaluation.\n\nAnderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty (AHDP) remains the gold standard operation for definitive treatment of UPJO.17 In this technique, the dynamic or stenotic segment is excised, the ureter is spatulated against the lower pole of the kidney followed by anastomosing the renal pelvis to the spatulated ureter over a transanastomotic stent. For a highly inserted ureter, Foley Y-V plasty was previously preferred, but it has been largely replaced by AHDP. Foley Y-V pyeloplasty may be appropriate for UPJO in setting of a horseshoe kidney.\nThe vascular hitch technique is still having a role in modern pediatric urology because it is less demanding and less time-consuming than AHDP. Moreover, its success rate is up to 90% with less complication rates (e.g., urinary leakage and anastomotic stricture). It involves elevation of the crossing vessel anteriorly away from the UPJ. However, concomitant intrinsic obstruction should be excluded by diuretic test to avoid technical failure.\n\nThe patient is placed in the lateral flank position where the targeted side is facing upwards. The incision is made anterior subcostal (Figure 8) with an extraperitoneal approach. After splitting or dividing the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles with medial retraction of the peritoneum and extraperitoneal (pararenal) fat, the two layers of Gerota’s fascia are opened. The UPJ is identified and two stay sutures are placed proximal and distal to the UPJ prior to dividing it.\n\n\nFigure 8 Anterior lumbar incision in front of the tip of the last rib for open left pyeloplasty\n\nThe UPJ is dismembered between the two stay sutures. Reduction pyeloplasty is done only in cases of marked redundant renal pelvis in which the excess renal pelvis is trimmed. On the other hand, other authors concluded that excision of the renal pelvis (reduction pyeloplasty) is not needed in most cases of dismembered pyeloplasty.26 They found that cases with or without reduction pyeloplasty had similar surgical outcomes. The next step is to anastomose the two limbs of the renal pelvis to the two ones of the spatulated ureter.\n\nThe first suture to be taken is that of the angle followed by the posterior suture line, inserting the transanastomotic stent and completing the anterior suture line. The remaining two limbs of the renal pelvis are sutured to each other. The sutures used are 6-0 vicryl (or other absorbable monofilament suture) either in a continuous or interrupted manner. In the very beginning of the learning curve, start with interrupted sutures until mastering the technique.\n\nAnother approach for open pyeloplasty other than the anterior lumbar approach is posterior or dorsal lumbotomy (DL) (Figure 9)27 It is the oldest approach used to gain access to the kidney and the upper ureter. However, it is not used nowadays on a wide scale especially in children. DL can be done via one of the following skin incisions; Gil-Vernet vertical incision along the lateral edge of sacrospinalis muscle, Lurz modification vertical incision following the lateral border of quadratus lumborum muscle, or transverse incision following Langer’s lines.\n\n\nFigure 9 Dorsal lumbotomy incision for left-sided open pyeloplasty\n\nThe main advantage of DL is easy access to the retroperitoneum via two simple incisions without muscle cutting. Large hydronephrotic kidney is no longer considered a contraindication for DL because the kidneys are usually more mobile in children. However, DL should be avoided in renal malrotation or malposition.\n\nAlthough open pyeloplasty is the standard technique in young age with a success rate of 95%, laparoscopic and robot-assisted techniques have comparable success rates.28 Minimally-invasive techniques have the advantage of less pain, shorter postoperative hospital stay and minimal scars at the trocar sites. Nevertheless, they require a special armamentarium with subsequent higher costs in addition to a relatively longer training curve. The use of the da Vinci® robotic system made intracorporeal suturing easier than before.\n\nLaparoscopic and robotic-assisted pyeloplasty can be done via a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach.28 The transperitoneal approach is more commonly used because of the evident anatomical landmarks and the relatively wide working space. Nonetheless, it has more complications than the retroperitoneal one in the form of organ injury and intestinal obstruction. In order to reduce the operative time and bowel manipulation in transperitoneal laparoscopic pyeloplasty, the transmesocolic approach is used to directly mobilize the left UPJ without colonic reflection.29\n\nIn laparoscopic pyeloplasty, at least three ports are used, one at the umbilicus by open method for the camera, and two working ports. The first working port is at the subcostal line while the second one is at the spino-umbilical line, and both are preferred to be at the pararectal line (Figure 10) In robotic pyeloplasty, the camera port is just superior to the umbilicus while the two working ports are midway between the umbilicus and the anterior superior iliac spine, and finger below the costal margin at the pararectal line. The assistant port is placed midway between the umbilicus and the xiphisternum (Figure 11)\n\n\nFigure 10 Port distribution for laparoscopic right-sided dismembered Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty\n\n\nFigure 11 Port distribution for robotic right-sided pyeloplasty\n\nIrrespective of the approach used, the main goal of pyeloplasty is to have a patent, dependent, funnel-shaped, water-tight, and tension-free anastomosis between the ureter and the renal pelvis. Transanastomotic stent may be external or internal or none at all.30\n\nThe external stent is exteriorized via the renal parenchyma or the renal pelvis and is usually left for ten to fourteen days. It is crucial to make sure that there is at least one pore within the renal pelvis to avoid stent obstruction by the ureter itself. In addition, avoid leaving pores outside the pelvicalyceal system for fear of postoperative urinary leakage.\n\nOne of the best ways to confirm that the lower coil of the double pigtail (double J) stent has reached the bladder is to fill the bladder via a previously fixed urethral catheter and to check the backflow. Another tip for placement is to use the smallest diameter stent available and place it over a hydrophilic wire. This has less chance of getting stuck at the ureterovesical junction and causing injury there, which has been reported. An internal stent is kept for one to four weeks and then removed using cystoscopy. Needing an additional session of anesthesia is a drawback of the internal stent. Leaving a tube drain is not a routine practice except in difficult or recurrent cases.\n\nMany surgeons prefer the use of external stent even in laparoscopic and robot-assisted approaches to avoid a second general anesthesia for internal stent removal.31,32 Externalized pyeloureteral Salle intraoperative pyeloplasty stent is another effective alternative to internal stenting because its cost is less than that of a second session of general anesthesia.32\n\nIn case of the redundant renal pelvis with a long segment defect, Culp-DeWeerd spiral flap or Scardino-Prince vertical flap are recommended. If the renal pelvis is insufficient for making a flap to bridge the gap between the renal pelvis and the ureter, ureterocalycostomy can be an option. In ureterocalycostomy, the ureter is anastomosed to the lower calyx after amputating the lower pole of the kidney.\n\nEndoscopic endopyelotomy is an option for short-segment stricture (less than two cm) in a salvageable kidney after excluding the presence of a crossing vessel.33 It can be done for primary or recurrent cases via either antegrade or retrograde approach using a cold knife or Holmium laser. It has lower success rates compared to AHDP (70% Vs 95%, respectively). It is contraindicated in the presence of active urinary tract infection, crossing vessel, and bleeding diathesis. For failed pyeloplasties, redo pyeloplasty has higher success rates (95-99%) compared to endoscopic endopyelotomy (39%), especially in young children and stricture segments of more than one centimeter.33\n\nComplications\n\nIf left untreated, UPJO can result in function deterioration of the affected kidney till complete function loss. Secondary hypertension is an uncommon complication. Complications of pyeloplasty are either early or late. Early complications include urinary leakage from the wound or the drain with or without collection, non-draining external stent, displaced internal stent, hematuria, fever, and wound infection. Late complications involve technical failure or restenosis.34\n\nUrinary leakage is managed by urinary diversion in the form of percutaneous nephrostomy or retrograde internal stent placement. It may be sometimes attributed to the presence of stent pores outside the kidney with subsequent leakage into the retroperitoneum. In the case of sizable perinephric collection, a percutaneous drain is advocated. A non-draining external stent may be due to a blood clot obstructing the stent or the absence of pores in the stent part within the renal pelvis while the rest of the drainage pores are obstructed by the ureter. The former cause is managed by stent flushing while the latter is treated with stent withdrawal.\n\nHematuria is usually managed conservatively by adequate hydration with or without hemostatic use whereas wound infection is treated with culture-based antimicrobial in addition to frequent wound dressing. In case of fever, the persistent obstruction should be excluded through RBUS followed by intravenous antibiotics.\n\nThe management of failed pyeloplasty depends mainly on the split renal function. In symptomatic obstructed poorly functioning kidney with a split function of less than 10-15%, nephrectomy is considered. In a salvageable kidney, redo pyeloplasty or sometimes endoscopic phlebotomy is done. The timing of intervention is at least three months after the primary surgery.\n\nSuggested follow-up\n\nIn cases with unilateral ANH, RBUS should be done once in the third trimester. If ANH is bilateral, RBUS should be performed on monthly basis until delivery, depending on the presence of signs suggestive of the lower urinary tract obstruction e.g. progressive hydronephrosis, oligohydramnios, or thickened bladder wall.11\n\nConservative management of asymptomatic pelvic dilatations with a split renal function of more than 40% is usually advocated because the majority of cases experience spontaneous resolution. Progressive hydronephrosis or renal function deterioration during observation is an accepted indication of definitive intervention to prevent subsequent further damage.\n\nThere is no consensus regarding the follow-up following pyeloplasty and what is published in literature is either expert opinion or anecdotal experience.35 At our institute, the patient is reviewed clinically after two weeks in case of external stent placement or after six weeks in case of internal stent fixation. Three months following surgery, RBUS is requested, and the grade of hydronephrosis and APRPD are observed. If there is an improvement in the aforementioned parameters, the next follow-up will be one year after surgery utilizing RBUS. In case of static RBUS, the upcoming follow-up will be three months later by RBUS. If progressive hydronephrosis is noticed or the patient is symptomatic, MAG3 scan should be requested.\n\nSuggested readings\n\n\n  Han HH, Ham WS, Kim JH, Hong CH, Choi YD, Han SW.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nDuplication, migration, and fusion anomalies of the urinary tract are common and lead to various structural and functional abnormalities. Anatomic sequelae of ureteral duplication include ectopic ureter, ureterocele, and vesicoureteral reflux. These may manifest clinically as urinary tract obstruction, infection, incontinence, and renal dysplasia. Common migration and fusion anomalies include renal ectopia and horseshoe kidney, which are occasionally associated with pathology including renal dysplasia, vesicoureteral reflux, obstruction, and stone disease. Severity varies widely, and treatment ranges from observation to major surgical reconstruction. Treatment, when indicated, is primarily surgical and is aimed at preservation of renal function, minimizing morbidity from urinary tract infection, correction of urinary incontinence, and relief of symptoms associated with urinary tract obstruction.\n\nEmbryology\n\nFamiliarity with the normal embryology of renal development is critical to understanding duplication, migration and fusion anomalies. Two embryologic structures give rise to the mature human kidney and ureters; the ureteric bud, which develops into the collecting system and ureters, and the metanephric mesenchyme, which develops into the nephrons and renal parenchyma. The ureteric bud originates as an epithelial outpouching off the distal mesonephric (Wolffian) duct. Normally, there is a single ureteric bud on each side which give rise to bilateral single ureters. The ureteric bud grows into the metanephric mesenchyme and a process of reciprocal induction causes nephrogenesis and ureteral branching. The renal unit with its branched collecting system (metanephros) migrates cranially and rotates 90 degrees such that the renal hilum is oriented medially. The ureter grows caudally to merge with the urogenital sinus, which becomes the bladder. Once incorporated into the urogenital sinus, the ureteral orifice migrates craniolaterally from the bladder neck to the orthotopic position on the trigonal ridge.1\n\nDuplication anomalies are thought to stem from supernumerary ureteral buds or early branching. Migration anomalies result from abnormal ascent or rotation. If the kidneys come into contact with each other they may fuse, resulting in a horseshoe kidney or crossed-fused renal ectopia.2\n\nEpidemiology and Pathophysiology\n\nTable 1 Common clinical pathologies in renal duplication.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Anomaly\n      Potential problems\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Incomplete duplication\n      Lower pole UPJ obstructionUreteroureteral reflux (theoretical)\n    \n    \n      Ectopic ureter\n      Upper pole obstructionUrinary incontinencePyelonephritisEpididymitis\n    \n    \n      Ureterocele\n      Upper pole obstructionLower pole obstructionBladder outlet obstructionDysfunctional voidingUrinary incontinence due to sphincter disruptionPyelonephritis\n    \n    \n      Vesicoureteral reflux\n      Reflux nephropathyPyelonephritis\n    \n  \n\n\nDuplication\n\nRenal duplication anomalies are the most common congenital urinary tract anomaly with an incidence of 0.8–5% noted on autopsy studies.3,4 A duplex kidney refers to a kidney with two moieties, upper and lower, each with an independent pyelocaliceal drainage system. Bilateral duplication occurs in 16–40% of cases, and duplication is detected more commonly in females.3,5 Duplication anomalies can be hereditary, with an incidence of 12–30% in affected families.6,7\n\nDuplication may be incomplete (partial) or complete. In incomplete duplication, the two collecting systems may join at any point before entering the bladder. This occurs when a single ureteral bud branches prior to reaching the metanephric mesenchyme.3 Most ureteral duplications are incomplete and clinically insignificant. Partial duplication ranges from a bifid renal pelvis to a Y-type duplication with the ureters joining at any point prior to their insertion into the bladder. One problem encountered with incomplete duplication is obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ), which occurs almost exclusively at the lower pole.8,9 The intrarenal architecture in duplicated systems may explain the predilection of UPJ obstructions for the lower pole. Typically, the upper-pole ureter drains a single infundibulum without a true pelvis. The lower pole, which comprises two-thirds of the parenchyma, usually contains at least two major calices and a true renal pelvis.9\n\nClinically-significant pathology more commonly arises from complete duplication. In complete duplication, independent ureters drain the upper and lower renal moieties and empty separately into the genitourinary tract. This occurs when two ureteral buds branch off the mesonephric duct. Each bud or branch induces maturation of an overlying renal unit. Distally, the lower ureter will be incorporated into the urogenital sinus first and will migrate further craniolaterally. The upper ureter is incorporated later or not at all and is thus medially and caudally displaced in the bladder or, if it never reaches the urogenital sinus, is ectopically located along the mesonephric duct derivatives. The craniolateral ureteral orifice is thus reliably associated with the lower renal moiety and the caudomedial ureteral orifice with the upper renal moiety, an embryologic relationship known as the Weigert-Meyer law.10,11 Rarely, additional ureteral buds or early branching may lead to ureteral triplication (Figure 1)\n\n\nFigure 1 Ureteral triplication. A: Intraoperative photo during upper to lower ureteroureterostomy. The proximal blue vessel loop surrounds the upper moiety ureter, which is ectopic to the bladder neck with obstruction. The red and yellow vessel loops surround the mid and lower moiety ureters, which are incompletely duplicated. B: Retrograde ureteropyelogram after ureteroureterostomy.\n\nEctopic Ureter\n\nAn ectopic ureter typically inserts caudal to the normal location on the trigonal ridge, along the pathway of the developing mesonephric system. In boys, ectopic ureters may open into bladder neck, posterior urethra (most common), or mesonephric duct derivatives: epididymis, seminal vesicle, or vas deferens.12 Notably, these locations are proximal to the urethral sphincter complex and thus never result in incontinence. By contrast, ectopic ureters in girls can terminate distal to the external sphincter and cause continuous urinary incontinence. The most common terminal sites of ectopic ureters in girls are the bladder neck and upper urethra (1/3), vaginal vestibule (1/3), vagina (1/4), and cervix, uterus, or rectum (rare).12,13 Approximately 75–90% of ectopic ureters are associated with the upper moiety of a duplex kidney.14,15\n\nProblems that result from ureteral ectopia include ureteral obstruction with resultant renal dysplasia and/or risk for infection, continuous urinary incontinence in girls, and occasionally epididymitis from urine reflux into the vas deferens in boys.\n\nUreterocele\n\nA ureterocele is a cystic dilatation of the terminal part of the ureter. The embryology is not entirely understood. One theory posits that ureteroceles result from persistence of Chwalle’s membrane, the primitive ureteral membrane that separates the ureteric bud from the developing urogenital sinus. Alternatively, some think that a ureterocele results from abnormal induction of bladder trigonal musculature.16,17\n\nVarious classification systems have been proposed based on the location of the ureteral opening, characteristics of the orifice, or association with single or duplex collecting systems. The classification adopted by the Section on Urology of the American Academy of Pediatrics is perhaps the simplest and categorizes ureteroceles based on the location of the dilated ureteral tissue.18 Ureteroceles are classified as either intravesical (orthotopic) or extravesical (ectopic). Intravesical ureteroceles are contained entirely within the bladder (Figure 2) Ureteroceles extending beyond the bladder neck are classified as extravesical. Occasionally, distinguishing the two can be difficult. For instance, an intravesical ureterocele may prolapse through the bladder neck and an extravesical ureterocele can have an intravesical ureteral orifice (Figure 3) Extravesical ureteroceles with submucosal extension beyond the bladder neck are sometimes called cecoureteroceles.\n\n\nFigure 2 Intravesical ureterocele. A: An intravesical ureterocele with its characteristic thin-walled cystic appearance on ultrasound (asterisk). Marked ureteral dilation is noted (arrow). B: The upper moiety associated with the ureterocele is hydronephrotic with renal parenchymal thinning. The lower moiety appears healthy.\n\n\nFigure 3 Ureterocele prolapse in a female infant.\n\nIn duplex systems, ureteroceles are nearly always associated with the upper pole and 60% are extravesical.16 Problems include obstruction of the upper and possibly the lower pole, which in the setting of urinary tract infection can present as florid sepsis. Obstruction is often associated with a dysplastic upper pole.19 Additionally, ureteroceles that prolapse can obstruct the bladder outlet. Large ureteroceles are associated with poor underlying bladder musculature, and ureteroceles that extend beyond the bladder neck can destroy the female continence mechanism.20,21\n\nVesicoureteral Reflux\n\nThe combination of ureteral duplication and vesicoureteral reflux is common. Reflux classically occurs into the lower pole ureter which has a laterally displaced ureteral orifice and shortened submucosal tunnel as predicted by the Weigert-Meyer law.22 The upper pole ureter, with its more medial and caudal orifice, has a longer submucosal tunnel and reflux is less likely. When reflux into upper and lower pole ureters occurs, both orifices tend to be laterally displaced or the duplication is partial. Reflux into the upper pole ureter may also occur if its orifice is ectopic to the bladder neck or urethra, presumably because it bypasses the trigone and has an inadequate submucosal tunnel. Reflux into such ureters only occurs during voiding, and the tonically closed bladder neck may cause obstruction during the storage phase (Figure 4) As in non-duplicated systems, sequelae of vesicoureteral reflux in duplicated systems include reflux nephropathy and pyelonephritis.\n\n\nFigure 4 Ectopic ureter inserting at the bladder neck. A: During bladder filling, no vesicoureteral reflux is noted. B: Vesicoureteral reflux becomes apparent during voiding. This kidney is noted to be ectopically located in the pelvis.\n\nMigration and Fusion Anomalies\n\nRenal ectopia refers to a kidney which fails to reach its normal position, and results from abnormal renal migration and/or fusion during embryologic development.23 Ectopic kidneys can be classified as simple, horseshoe or crossed. The reported incidence ranges from 1 in 500 to 1 in 5,000.24,25\n\nSimple Ectopia\n\nSimple renal ectopia refers to a kidney located anywhere along the ipsilateral embryological path of ascent from the pelvis to the renal fossa. Pelvic kidneys fail to ascend past the pelvic brim and are the most common ectopic kidneys, accounting for 60% of all cases.26 In 90% the anomaly is unilateral and with a slight left-sided preponderance.26 Other ectopic kidney positions can occur and lie at some point between the pelvis and the normal position or, rarely, within the thorax.27\n\nHorseshoe Kidney\n\nHorseshoe kidney is the most common renal fusion anomaly, with an incidence between 1:400 and 1:1800.28,29 In 95% of cases the lower poles of the two kidneys are joined by an isthmus of renal tissue, which usually consists of vascularized parenchyma but is sometimes dysplastic or fibrous.29 In about 40% of cases the isthmus lies at the level of L4 where it gets caught beneath the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery during renal ascent. Rarely, the isthmus can lie posterior to the aorta and/or inferior vena cava.30 A small proportion of horseshoe kidneys are fused at their upper poles.31 The presence of the isthmus prevents complete medial rotation of the renal pelves and the ureters must arch anteriorly to pass over the isthmus, which explains the relatively high incidence of ureteropelvic anomalies (20%) associated with horseshoe kidneys (Figure 5)32,33,34\n\n\nFigure 5 Horseshoe kidney with left ureteropelvic junction obstruction. The isthmus (fused lower poles) is marked by a square. Hydronephrosis is noted on the left side.\n\nCrossed Renal Ectopia\n\nCrossed renal ectopia occurs when one or both kidneys cross the midline during migration. There are four varieties of crossed renal ectopia: crossed fused renal ectopia wherein the ectopic kidney fuses with the contralateral kidney (85% of cases), crossed renal ectopia without fusion, bilateral crossed ectopia, and solitary crossed ectopia. There is a slight male predominance, and crossing from left to right occurs more frequently than from right to left. In crossed fused renal ectopia, the point of fusion is usually between the upper pole of the crossed kidney and the lower pole of the normally positioned kidney (unilateral fused type, (Figure 6)35,36,37,38\n\n\nFigure 6 Crossed fused renal ectopia. Retrograde pyelogram demonstrates distinct ureters. The left kidney is located to the right of midline. Its upper pole is fused to the lower pole of the right kidney.\n\nEctopic kidneys are often asymptomatic. When detected, they are commonly hypoplastic or irregular in shape. Vesicoureteral reflux is the most common associated anomaly, which has been reported in 30–70% of kidneys in children with renal ectopia. Interestingly, in cases of simple renal ectopia, unilateral reflux is frequently seen in the orthotopic kidney.32,33,39 Malrotation and high insertion of the ureter may lead to ureteropelvic junction obstruction, urine stasis, and associated nephrolithiasis.32,33,34 Further, because kidneys derive their vasculature from nearby vessels during embryological ascent, the vascular supply is predictably anomalous in renal ectopia and fusion anomalies. In one study of 90 horseshoe kidneys, 387 arteries were identified, and nearly one fourth of patients had anomalous renal vein anatomy.40\n\nMigration and fusion anomalies are also commonly associated with non-urologic anomalies. Horseshoe kidney, for instance, is present in 14–20% of girls with Turner syndrome.29 Renal ectopia and horseshoe kidneys are frequently seen in children with anorectal malformations and genital anomalies, sometimes as part of the VACTERL syndrome.41 In males, genital anomalies may include hypospadias and cryptorchidism.32 While renal agenesis is the classic genitourinary finding in females with Müllerian anomalies, uterine duplication and vaginal agenesis have also been reported in association migration and fusion anomalies.42,43\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nDuplication\n\nDuplication anomalies may be diagnosed antenatally by routine sonogram. Postnatally, duplication is frequently diagnosed upon workup for urinary tract infection (UTI); approximately 8% of children who present with a UTI are found to have duplication.44,45,46 In toilet-trained girls duplication may present with incontinence if an ectopic ureter inserts distal to the urinary sphincter complex.13,47 Children may also present with symptoms of urinary tract obstruction such as intermittent pain or failure to thrive.48 Commonly, duplication presents as an incidental finding on imaging.49\n\nEvaluation of ureteral duplication focuses on the diagnosis, prevention, and management of hydronephrosis, urinary tract infection, renal dysfunction and voiding problems. Incidentally detected duplication in the absence of these findings does not require further investigation. Increasingly, duplication anomalies are being detected antenatally as hydronephrosis or ureteroceles are noted on obstetric sonograms.50 Rarely, bilateral renal dysplasia or significant renal scarring may be present, resulting in impaired renal function. As with all children with renal dysplasia, renal function and electrolyte levels must be monitored, children should be screened for hypertension and proteinuria. Various tests may yield valuable information regarding complete or incomplete ureteral duplication, ectopia, ureteral dilation, ureteroceles, and relative renal function.\n\nUltrasound\n\nEssentially all patients with renal duplication require an ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder. This will detect upper and/or lower pole hydronephrosis, hydroureter, ureteroceles, and give some information as to the function of each renal unit based on the appearance of the renal parenchyma. Upper moiety hydronephrosis may occur secondary to an obstructed ectopic ureter or ureterocele. Frequently, associated hydroureter is seen (Figure 2) Marked dysplasia is commonly seen secondary to obstructive nephropathy. Normal renal parenchyma without ureteral dilation can suggest incidental duplication or an ectopic ureter that is not obstructed (Figure 7) In girls, this should prompt questions about continuous incontinence to evaluate for ectopic ureters distal to the urethral sphincter (e.g., “has she ever had a period of dryness?”). Lower moiety hydronephrosis may be caused by vesicoureteral reflux, UPJ obstruction, or ureteral obstruction secondary to an upper pole ureterocele. Sonographically, a ureterocele appears as a thin-walled cystic intravesical structure (Figure 2), which may contain debris suggestive of urine stasis or infection.\n\n\nFigure 7 Continuous incontinence in a female due to bilateral ectopic ureters. A: Renal ultrasound demonstrates two healthy renal moieties without hydronephrosis. B: Magnetic resonance urography delineates the ureteral anatomy. In this case, both upper pole ureters entered the vagina.\n\nVoiding Cystourethrography\n\nVCUG is the study of choice to detect and characterize vesicoureteral reflux. In duplicated systems, reflux into the lower ureter only affects the inferolateral calyces, a radiographic pattern known as the “drooping lily sign” (Figure 8) VCUG may also demonstrate ureteroceles, which appear as filling defects in the bladder and are best seen during early filling (Figure 8) The dynamic nature of this modality yields information regarding bladder neck obstruction, ureterocele prolapse, and ureterocele eversion, which appears as a bladder diverticulum when the bladder is distended and suggests poor trigonal musculature. VCUG should be obtained if urinary tract dilation is seen on ultrasound to evaluate for high grade vesicoureteral reflux, and prior to urinary tract reconstruction as the presence of vesicoureteral reflux will influence surgical decision-making.\n\n\nFigure 8 A: “Drooping lily sign.” Vesicoureteral reflux into the lower ureter fills the lower and interpolar calyces. The upper moiety collecting system does not fill. B: A ureterocele appears as a filling defect in the bladder.\n\nRenal Scintigraphy\n\nNuclear renal scans demonstrate relative function and drainage of the renal moieties. In the non-pathologic duplex kidney, the relative function of the upper and lower moieties is one third and two thirds, respectively.51\n\nMagnetic Resonance Urography\n\nMRU provides precise anatomic detail in patients with complex anatomy that may be difficult to visualize with other modalities. MRU may be especially useful in tracing ectopic ureters (Figure 7) MRU is also useful in patients with ureteroceles that obscure other aspects of the bladder, or in patients with uterine, vaginal or other bladder anomalies.52 Computational software allows calculation of differential renal function and urine transit times, however this software is expensive, complex, and not yet widely available.53\n\nIntravenous Urography\n\nWith other modalities available, IVU is now rarely performed. It can reveal duplication and the level of confluence, ureteral ectopia, and ureteroceles, among other anomalies. When upper moiety function is poor, associated pathology is not always demonstrated and delayed images may be helpful.\n\nMigration and Fusion Anomalies\n\nAbnormalities of ascent and fusion are commonly incidental findings. Non-dilated pelvic ectopic kidneys may be difficult to visualize on ultrasound, and absence of the kidney in the renal fossa may be misinterpreted as renal agenesis.24,54 In such cases the presence of ectopic functioning renal tissue is best demonstrated by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renography.54 VCUG is not mandatory in the absence of urinary tract infections and hydronephrosis, as vesicoureteral reflux in this setting tends to be low grade and clinically insignificant.55 Symptoms such as renal colic and urinary tract infection generally denote additional pathology, such as high grade vesicoureteral reflux, nephrolithiasis, or UPJ obstruction, all of which are more common with renal ectopia and should prompt further evaluation (Figure 5)32,33,34\n\nTreatment Options, Outcomes, and Complications\n\nDuplication\n\nManagement of renal duplication depends upon the pathology at hand, and ranges from observation with or without antibiotic prophylaxis to minimally invasive surgery to open urinary tract reconstruction. In the absence of infection, obstruction, or urinary incontinence, duplication anomalies may be safely observed. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in patients with duplication and ureteral dilation due to obstructing ectopic ureter, ureterocele, or dilating vesicoureteral reflux.56,57 Definitive urinary tract reconstruction can occur at the bladder level (lower tract) or at the kidney level (upper tract). A combined upper and lower tract approach is rarely necessary. The function of the renal moieties and the presence of vesicoureteral reflux are critical factors in formulating a surgical plan. If a patient has bladder level pathology including vesicoureteral reflux or a large or ectopic ureterocele, a lower tract approach is best.\n\nUreterocele Incision\n\nEndoscopic decompression of the ureterocele was initially suggested in the early 1960s. The initial approach was to unroof the ureterocele, which was successful but incurred a high rate of de novo vesicoureteral reflux. In 1962, Zielinski suggested a low, medial, transverse incision at the base of the ureterocele.58 This provides adequate ureteral decompression while residual ureterocele tissue creates a functional flap valve to prevent de novo vesicoureteral reflux. The opening created should be intravesical to avoid obstruction by the tonically closed bladder neck. The incision can be completed with electrocautery, laser, or a cold knife. Successful initial decompression is seen in upwards of 90% of patients.59 More recently, a “watering can” approach has been advocated in the absence of infection wherein the ureterocele is punctured 10–20 times with a laser.60 This technique yields durable decompression with markedly reduced iatrogenic reflux, however the need for secondary procedures is less well-studied. For intravesical ureteroceles, regardless of technique, primary endoscopic decompression is frequently the only intervention needed.61,62,63 For ectopic ureteroceles, long-term outcomes are not as good; ureterocele decompression may be considered a temporizing operation as 50% to 80% will require secondary reconstruction due to symptomatic reflux or urinary incontinence.59,62,63\n\nSubureteric Injection\n\nAs in single systems, vesicoureteral reflux in duplex systems can be managed with subureteric injection of bulking agents. Success was initially reported to be lower than in single systems, though subsequent analyses report comparable rates of success.64 The manufacturer of dextranomer-hyaluronic acid (Deflux®) has recently removed duplication as a contraindication. Resolution of vesicoureteral reflux after subureteric injection is related to age, sex, degree and timing of reflux, and is discussed in detail in the following chapter dedicated to vesicoureteral reflux.\n\nUreteral Clipping\n\nUreteral clipping is a newly described technique for management of the obstructed, nonfunctioning upper moiety.65,66 The upper moiety ureter is laparoscopically transected, drained, and ligated near the kidney with the expectation that the nonfunctioning renal tissue atrophies. This technique avoids the risk of de novo reflux associated with ureterocele puncture and is less invasive than traditional reconstruction for an ectopic ureter but requires ongoing surveillance and carries risks include symptomatic obstruction, infection, and even pyonephrosis, and has not been widely adopted.\n\nLower Tract Reconstruction\n\nThe lower urinary tract may be approached intra- or extra-vesically. Extravesical operations such as ureteroureterostomy may be performed through an inguinal or Gibson incision, depending on patient age. The floor of the inguinal canal is opened, the perivesical space is developed and the ureters are found posterolateral to the medial umbilical ligament. Some will pre-place ureteral stents in nondilated ureters to aid in their identification. In males, care is taken to avoid damaging the vas deferens, which drapes over the ureters. Intravesical operations such as cross-trigonal ureteral reimplantation are performed through a Pfannenstiel incision. Laparoscopic approaches involve traditional port placement for pelvic surgery, including an umbilical camera port and left and right infraumbilical working ports.\n\nUreteroureterostomy\n\nUreteroureterostomy is an excellent solution when there is isolated upper or lower pole pathology, but not both.67 If there is isolated lower vesicoureteral reflux, the lower ureter can be anastomosed to the upper ureter in an end-to-side fashion. More commonly, an upper-to-lower ureteroureterostomy is performed in the setting of an ectopic ureter causing urinary incontinence or obstruction. Upper pole ureters that are obstructed by small intravesical ureteroceles may also be managed with ureteroureterostomy; large ureteroceles or ectopic ureteroceles may require an intravesical operation for formal ureterocele excision and bladder floor reconstruction.68 Ureteroureterostomy has several advantages. It avoids the complex dissection around the renal hilum required with heminephrectomy, and avoids the need to open the bladder or taper dilated ureters as is required with traditional ureteral reimplantation. If there is no ureteral dilation, the ureter should be spatulated to allow a widely patent anastomosis. Long-term success rates exceed 90% in experienced hands.69,70,71,72 Risks include ureteroureteral (“yo-yo”) reflux, damage to the recipient ureter, anastomotic stenosis, urine leak, and infection of the ureteral stump, all of which are rare. A proximal anastomosis with excision of the distal ureteral stump may decrease infection of the ureteral stump, and is easily performed laparoscopically.73,74 If the ureters share a common sheath, excision of the distal ureteral stump should not be aggressively pursued in order to avoid damaging the shared blood supply. Stents, if placed, may either traverse the anastomosis or remain in the recipient ureter.\n\nUreteral Reimplantation\n\nIsolated vesicoureteral reflux in duplex systems is treated as it is in single systems. When vesicoureteral reflux is present in addition to an ectopic or obstructed ureter requiring intervention, ureteral reimplantation is traditionally the procedure of choice. Distally, duplicated ureters are often located within a common sheath and share a distal blood supply. In this case, ureters must be mobilized and reimplanted en bloc.75 An ectopic ureter will not necessarily share a blood supply with the lower pole ureter. In this case, the ureters may be reimplanted independently.76 Alternatively, a combination upper-to-lower ureteroureterostomy and lower ureteral reimplant may be performed.77,78\n\nUreters may be reimplanted via an intravesical or extravesical approach, with or without ureteral tailoring. Bilateral extravesical reimplantation is avoided due to the risk of pelvic plexus damage and urinary retention. Reimplantation of obstructed or ectopic ureters, ureteral tailoring, and excision of associated ureteroceles requires dismembering the ureter and opening the bladder mucosa, and many surgeons prefer an intravesical approach in this setting. Vesicoscopic approaches to ureteral reimplantation have been described, but long-term outcomes are yet to be reported and the traditional laparoscopic approach is extravesical.79 The success rate of common sheath reimplantation is over 95%, similar to single-system reimplantation.80,81\n\nExcision of Ureterocele and Bladder Reconstruction\n\nUreteroceles not decompressed endoscopically, or large ureteroceles with underlying abnormal musculature, are sometimes addressed with open surgery. This may include excision or marsupialization of the ureterocele, bladder floor reconstruction, and/or bladder neck reconstruction.82 Excision of the ureterocele is often performed at the time of ureteral reimplantation. Redundant mucosa is excised taking care not to leave a mucosal flap which can obstruct the bladder. The detrusor defect may be is reconstructed to ensure adequate backing for the reimplanted ureter. Contralateral reflux can result, presumably due to trigonal distortion, though the clinical significance is unclear. When the ureterocele extends past the bladder neck there is a significant risk of stress urinary incontinence and bladder dysfunction. Prudent dissection is required, however even with meticulous technique voiding and continence outcomes are poor and are felt to be intrinsic rather than acquired.68,83\n\nCutaneous Ureterostomy\n\nThis is a temporizing operation performed in the setting of urinary tract infection in the young patient.16 It is indicated for the infected, obstructed upper pole ureter or the refluxing lower pole ureter with breakthrough urinary tract infections on antibiotic prophylaxis. The open surgical approach is similar to a ureteroureterostomy. The pathologic ureter(s) are incised or transected and marsupialized to the inguinal skin incision. In infants, the combination of small bladders and dilated ureters precludes an adequate ureteral tunnel, and reimplantation is usually delayed. Ureteral dilation often improves with diversion, which may obviate the need for tailoring at the time of reimplantation. Definitive reconstruction is performed when the patient is 1-2 years of age. Notably, diverting ureterostomy is an excellent option for managing ureteroceles when endoscopic equipment is not available.\n\nUpper Tract Approach\n\nUpper tract reconstruction is appropriate when there is no lower urinary tract pathology to be addressed. Even so, a lower tract approach is often considered due it its relative ease and success.84,85\n\nHeminephrectomy\n\nThe indication for upper heminephrectomy a poorly functioning upper pole with associated urinary incontinence or upper pole pathology (e.g. pyelonephritis, stones). The upper pole ureter is divided and used for traction. The upper pole hilar vessels are ligated, and the nonviable renal parenchyma demarcates, and is excised. Alternatively, the upper pole parenchyma, which is often poorly vascularized and easily delineated from the healthy lower pole, can be excised and traced to the upper pole hilar vessels and ureter, which are then divided. This simplifies the hilar dissection but risks bleeding. The cut edge of renal parenchyma is covered with Gerota’s fascia and perirenal fat. Redundant upper pole ureter is removed but the residual ureteric stump is left in situ. Utmost care is taken not to damage blood supply to the lower pole parenchyma or ureter.\n\nLoss of lower pole function is the most significant complication related to upper heminephrectomy, with reported rates as high as nine percent.84,86 This can be due to hilar injury or post-operative torsion of the remaining kidney, and is more common in children younger than 1 year. For fully mobilized kidneys, consider nephropexy to prevent torsion of the renal remnant. Additional complications include postoperative bleeding (&lt;5%), urinoma (5–20%, more common in laparoscopic procedures, rarely clinically significant).87,88 While upper heminephrectomy was once the procedure of choice for the nonfunctional upper pole without lower pole reflux, practice patterns are shifting towards ureteroureterostomy which is a simpler operation with similar success rates and less risk to lower pole function.84,85\n\nLower heminephrectomy is less common. This is done for clinically significant pathology (e.g., infection, symptomatic obstruction, stones) in the setting of a nonfunctional lower moiety with preservation of the upper pole. This occurs secondary to UPJ obstruction or high-grade vesicoureteral reflux. This operation can be more challenging than upper heminephrectomy, as the lower pole nests within the upper pole making it difficult to separate. Complications, and outcomes are similar to upper pole heminephrectomy.89\n\nPyeloplasty, Pyelo-Ureterostomy, Proximal Ureteroureterostomy\n\nAs noted previously, ureteroureterostomy with a proximal anastomosis carries some advantages over a distal anastomosis. With a laparoscopic approach, a flank incision is avoided and there is negligible additional morbidity compared to a distal anastomosis.73,74 Lower pole UPJ obstruction necessitates an upper tract approach. The particular technique depends on the configuration of the collecting system. With incomplete duplication the lower ureter may be short, precluding a traditional pyeloplasty. A pyelo-ureterostomy is performed by creating a side-to-side or end-to-side anastomosis between the obstructed lower pole renal pelvis and the upper pole ureter.9,90 If there is concomitant lower pole reflux, an end-to-side anastomosis with drainage and ligation of the ureteral stump is best. In cases of complete duplication, traditional pyeloplasty is an alternative which avoids risks to the upper drainage system.9 Complications and outcomes are similar to ureteroureterostomy and traditional pyeloplasty.\n\nMigration and Fusion Anomalies\n\nInvestigation of an uncomplicated ectopic or horseshoe kidney can reasonably be limited to ultrasound. If there is no hydronephrosis and the child is asymptomatic, additional workup is unnecessary. In the setting of an empty renal fossa, a DMSA scintigram may locate ectopic renal tissue.50 Additional investigations are indicated if there is hydronephrosis or a history of documented infection raising concern for vesicoureteral reflux. It is important to stress that the majority of patients are untroubled by their abnormally placed kidney, and surgical intervention should be confined to correcting coexisting pathology, obstruction, or reflux. When surgery is warranted, surgeons must anticipate the anomalous renal vasculature.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Duplication and migration anomalies are common, and most are clinically insignificant.\n  Clinically significant pathology varies widely. Management focuses on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of urinary tract obstruction, infection, renal dysfunction, and voiding problems.\n  In complete duplication, the upper ureter is prone to obstruction due to a ureterocele or ectopic insertion, whereas the lower ureter is prone to vesicoureteral reflux.\n  Management of extravesical ureteroceles is complex, and there may be longstanding problems with voiding and continence.\n  Consider upper and lower moiety renal function and the presence of vesicoureteral reflux when formulating a surgical plan in duplex systems.\n  When surgery is warranted in renal ectopia, bear in mind that the renal vasculature will be aberrant.\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Ross JH, Kay R.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nVesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters and sometimes kidneys. VUR is a risk factor for recurrent pyelonephritis, renal scarring, renal insufficiency and hypertension and is cited as a cause of end-stage renal disease in children.1,2,3,4 Management of reflux is primarily aimed at reducing the development of these long-term adverse effects through prevention of pyelonephritis.\n\nA paradigm shift in the evaluation and management of VUR has occurred over the last several decades, and clinicians should be aware of controversies in VUR management. It appears that active treatment of reflux has improved outcomes for some children such that the incidence of reflux-associated nephropathy continues to decline, but recent urologic literature suggests that the natural history of VUR does not follow a uniform pathway. Many children with reflux do not benefit from either diagnosis or treatment, as there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution without adverse effects.5,6 Clarification of which children do benefit from treatment is the greatest challenge to the advancement of vesicoureteral reflux management.\n\nBackground, Incidence, and Pathophysiology\n\nVUR occurs in approximately 1-3% of children, and 2.3% of new-onset ESRD patients aged 0-21 in the United States are reported to have a primary diagnosis attributed to reflux nephropathy. Incidence of ESRD with reflux nephropathy as a primary etiology has decreased steadily over the last twenty years.7 Previous international studies have estimated a higher prevalence of about 10%.5,8\n\nAlthough anatomic references to the concept of reflux were made as early as the first century AD, pivotal studies in the 1950s first contributed to our understanding of the association of VUR, chronic pyelonephritis and renal scarring as we understand it today.9,10\n\nVUR can be categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary VUR is attributed to an abnormally short intramural portion of ureter tunnelling through the detrusor muscle at the ureterovesical junction. In a normal junction, the intramural ureter is passively compressed during bladder filling, creating an antireflux mechanism. This mechanism is dependent on intramural length-to-diameter ratio and ureterovesical insertion angle.11\n\nA short intravesical tunnel is associated with VUR, and the tunnel length is inversely proportional to the severity of the reflux.12\n\nSecondary VUR develops when abnormal lower urinary tract function and elevated intravesical pressures overcome the antireflux mechanism and is associated with conditions like bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., posterior urethral valve) or neurogenic bladder. Secondary VUR may also be seen in children with no anatomic genitourinary or neurologic abnormality, but suffering from bladder and bowel dysfunction.13 The most frequent cause of secondary reflux is non-neurogenic bowel and bladder dysfunction, which is also one of the greatest risk factors for breakthrough UTIs.\n\nInheritance\n\nA strong inheritance pattern exists with primary VUR, with up to 80% of identical and 35% of fraternal twins concordant for presence of VUR.2 Multiple polymorphisms associated with abnormalities in ureteral budding have been identified in patients with primary VUR, although no single gene has been found to predominate.14 The probability of a non-twin sibling having reflux is about 25% and the chances of offspring having reflux are approximately 35-50%.15,16 Interestingly, this relationship is not as strong in children with dysfunctional elimination which likely speaks to the secondary nature of VUR in this cohort.17\n\nVesicoureteral Reflux, Urinary Tract Infections, and Renal Scarring\n\nThe clinical significance of VUR lies largely in its association with congenital renal dysplasia as well as renal parenchymal damage occurring secondary to recurrent pyelonephritis. At least one-third of VUR patients have renal scars.18,19 The presence of scarring implies regions of renal damage and increases the risk for long-term adverse sequelae.\n\nCongenital Reflux Nephropathy\n\nIn newborns with VUR, scars have been detected in association with high-grade reflux before the occurrence of clinical UTI.20 These “congenital scars” are thought to be regions of focal dysplasia or hypoplasia resulting from abnormal nephrogenesis as opposed to damaged normal tissue following pyelonephritis. Congenital renal dysplasia may be indistinguishable from acquired renal scars secondary to infection. Since DMSA scans are not routinely performed on neonates, it is unknown what proportion of renal scars attributed to infectious injury are actually due to abnormalities of embryogenesis.21 While the ultimate etiology remains uncertain, they are regions of diminished renal function and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality independent of the development of infection-associated renal scarring.22\n\nPyelonephritis and Renal Scarring\n\nUrinary tract infections are common in children, affecting about 5% of girls and about half as many boys.23 An estimated 30-40% of children under the age of 5 who develop urinary tract infections have VUR upon further evaluation.24,25 Renal scarring is believed to occur when infected urine comes in contact with renal parenchyma causing an inflammatory reaction; it has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency.3,26\n\nVUR as a factor predisposing to renal injury due to infection was first recognized in spinal cord injury patients. After surgical correction, these children had fewer episodes of pyelonephritis and urosepsis.27 Further studies demonstrated a lower rate of new renal scars developing in children with primary reflux compared to those with secondary reflux from neurogenic bladder or voiding dysfunction.28,29\n\nPermanent renal injury resulting from pyelonephritis can be identified as renal scarring on 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning. In a meta-analysis examining the presence of renal damage in children hospitalized with urinary tract infection, approximately 34% of children with pyelonephritis had VUR, and of those with VUR and pyelonephritis, 72% had an abnormal DMSA scan.30\n\nRenal scarring on nuclear scintigraphy may be detectable during or shortly after an acute episode of pyelonephritis. The sequelae from renal scars may not become apparent for many years; as long as 30-40 years have been reported between first renal-scarring pyelonephritis and the development of hypertension or end-stage renal disease.27 The prolonged time between the apparent initial renal insult and the clinically apparent effects underscores the need for long-term follow-up of patients with VUR.\n\nReflux Grading and Other Predictors of Outcomes\n\nBecause there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution of VUR in most children but potentially devastating clinical sequelae in others, identifying those most at risk is a primary aim of VUR management. The International Reflux Study classified VUR along a 5-point scale defined by the degree of retrograde urine flow and the accompanying distortion of the pyelocalyceal system (Figure 1)31 Higher grades are associated with decreased spontaneous resolution rates and increased prevalence of renal scars.23,32\n\n\nFigure 1 International Reflux Grading System.31\n\n\n  Grade I: reflux into the ureter only\n  Grade II: reflux into a non-dilated pyelocalyceal system\n  Grade III: dilatation of the collecting system (Figure 2)\n  Grade IV: more extensive dilation with blunting of the calyces and tortuosity of the ureter (Figure 3)\n  Grade V: massive dilation of the collecting system and severe tortuosity of the ureter (Figure 4)\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Grade III VUR\n\n\nFigure 3 Grade IV VUR\n\n\nFigure 4 Grade V VUR\n\nMultiple studies demonstrate a direct correlation between prevalence of renal scarring and grade of reflux..33 Renal scarring develops less often in non-dilating reflux.22,34,35 The chance of developing further renal parenchymal loss has been shown to be higher in children with grades III-V reflux than in those with grades I-II.36,37 Renal scars have also been demonstrated to be a negative predictor of VUR resolution independent of reflux grade.38 Unfortunately, the international reflux grading system is subjective with poor inter-rater reliability.39,40\n\nMore recently, additional factors influencing reflux resolution and breakthrough UTIs have been identified. Clinical factors predictive of reflux resolution, risk of renal injury and/or breakthrough UTIs include age, gender (female gender increases risk), circumcision status (circumcision is protective for UTI), presence of bladder and bowel dysfunction, and prior history of UTI. Radiographic predictors include laterality (unilateral vs. bilateral), distal ureteral diameter ratio (relative to the L1-L3 intervertebral body distance),41,42,43,44,45 bladder volume at the onset of reflux (normalized as a percentage of age predicted bladder capacity),46 bladder pressure at the onset of reflux, whether reflux occurs in the filling or voiding phase, and presence of renal scars.38,47\n\nFor neonates, a six-point vesicoureteral reflux index utilizing gender, VUR grade, anatomic ureteral abnormalities, and time of reflux during VCUG was shown to be predictive of VUR resolution, time to improvement, and breakthrough UTI.48,49 Similarly, a user-friendly neural network has been created utilizing demographic information, VUR grade, laterality, bladder volume at onset of VUR, UTI history, bladder or bowel dysfunction, and presence of breakthrough febrile UTIs to predict likelihood of VUR resolution, and is available at http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu.50 Consideration of multiple risk factors improves prediction of clinical outcomes and permits more tailored individualized management of each patient.\n\nBowel and Bladder Dysfunction\n\nChildren with bowel or bladder dysfunction have been consistently shown to have higher incidence of breakthrough UTIs, more renal scarring, a lower spontaneous resolution rate of VUR, and a higher failure rate following surgical treatment than children with “normal” elimination habits.1,51 These findings should be taken into consideration when determining management options for potty-trained children with VUR.\n\nReflux Nephropathy/Renal Scarring\n\nChildren with renal scars are more likely to develop further UTIs and additional scars than children without renal scars.34,52,53 One retrospective study of 120 patients demonstrated a significantly higher chance of developing a breakthrough urinary tract infection in those with grades III-V reflux and an abnormality on baseline DMSA scan (60%) compared to those without an abnormality (6%), and another study showed a relative risk of breakthrough UTI of 5.1 in patients with renal scarring.54,55 In a study with mean follow-up of 12 years after an anti-reflux operation, children with unilateral renal scars had an 11% chance of developing hypertension and an 18.5% chance if they had bilateral renal scars.56 Others have suggested the incidence of hypertension in children with bilateral renal scars is about 20%.57 Children with severe bilateral renal scars are significantly more likely to develop proteinuria, chronic renal insufficiency and renal failure than those with unilateral scars or unscarred kidneys.58,59 These data strongly suggest that children with scarring are at increased risk for further development of additional scars and long-term clinical sequelae.\n\nDiagnosis and Evaluation\n\nVoiding Cystourethrography and Nuclear Cystogram\n\nThe only tests that routinely and reliably detect reflux are voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and nuclear cystography. A VCUG is performed by instilling contrast retrograde via a urethral catheter into the bladder and obtaining fluoroscopic images of the upper and lower urinary tracts during filling and voiding. A nuclear cystogram is performed using a radioisotope scanning technique. VCUG is an appropriate initial test as it provides better anatomic details, including the presence or absence of periureteral diverticula, ureteral duplication, and bladder or urethral abnormalities. It also allows for more precise grading of reflux. In addition, it permits measurement of the distal ureteral diameter which has been shown to be more objective and reliable than grade and of equal or greater predictive value in terms of resolution and clinical outcomes.41,42,43,44,45\n\nNuclear cystography is beneficial in that it reduces radiation dose compared to VCUG. Nuclear cystography reliably detects all grades of vesicoureteral reflux and may be more sensitive for the detection of intermittent VUR (Figure 5)60,61\n\n\nFigure 5 Left VUR on nuclear cystogram\n\nIf a VCUG demonstrates no significant anatomic abnormalities, nuclear cystography may be performed for follow-up studies in order to limit radiation exposure. Although the nuclear cystogram is frequently considered a more sensitive test, the ordering practitioner should be aware that each type of cystogram has limitations to its ability to detect reflux in a given population.62\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics Sections on Urology and Radiology created a standard protocol for performance of VCUG in 2016 to maximize patient safety and ensure accurate results that directly affect patient management.63 Key recommendations included observing ALARA principles,64 filling the bladder by gravity at 100 cm above the exam table, obtaining images of the urethra during the voiding phase, performing a cyclic study (multiple fill cycles), estimating maximum bladder capacity, recording bladder volume at which time VUR occurs, recording postvoid residual, recording bladder or urethra abnormalities (e.g., bladder diverticuli or posterior urethral valve), and grading reflux according to the International Reflux Study.\n\nIn addition to radiation exposure, catheterization can be a traumatic experience for a young child. Efforts to decrease the traumatic nature of VCUG include the use of lubricants containing local anesthetics, use of child life specialists, and conscious sedation. Historically, cystograms were repeated annually; however, with improved ability to predict timing of resolution it has been suggested that in children less likely to resolve VUR, the interval between cystograms should be lengthened to decrease exposure to radiation, the number of traumatic studies, and cost.50,65,66,67\n\nA relatively recently-adopted imaging modality in some centers is that of contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography (ceVUS), which has been shown in several studies to be safe and comparable to VCUG in detecting grade 2 or higher VUR, detecting intrarenal reflux and having good interobserver reliability (Figure 6) It allows complete avoidance of ionizing radiation but does still necessitate catheterization and intravesical instillation of the contrast agent. Second-generation ultrasound contrast agents were not widely available until recently FDA-approved in the United States.68,69 VCUG does remain the gold standard for diagnosis of VUR until further research can show equivalent sensitivity and specificity of other testing methods.\n\n\nFigure 6 A.

Using this approach, only in those children with an abnormal scan should a VCUG be obtained. The benefit of such an approach would be a reduction in the number of children undergoing VCUG and the identification of reflux in a higher risk group; in theory, patients with reflux but no structural or functional renal abnormalities might go undiagnosed, but the absence of such renal abnormalities suggests that the reflux is not likely to be clinically significant. Use of ultrasound as an alternative to renal scan has not been accepted because of decreased sensitivity. One study noted that up to 25% of patients with cortical defects on DMSA had a normal ultrasound, providing further data on the utility of renal scans in the evaluation of children with febrile UTIs.72\n\nMercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) scanning also has an improved ability to detect renal scarring compared to IVP. Although the DMSA scan is considered by many to be the most sensitive test for renal scar detection; the reported sensitivity rate of the MAG3 compared to the DMSA varies from 88% to equal to or slightly better than a DMSA scan.73,74,75 Advantages of MAG3 include lower radiation exposure, cost, and time requirement, as well as visualization of the collecting system which may improve specificity compared to DMSA in those with significant dilation of the collecting system.73 Nuclear scintigraphy is usually deferred until 4-6 weeks of age to ensure adequate renal development for accurate results.\n\nIndications for Diagnostic Testing\n\nThe diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux is generally made after one or more UTIs or when suspected on the basis of abnormal renal imaging. Screening for VUR has traditionally been recommended in patients with prenatally-diagnosed urinary tract dilation (UTD) because reflux has been reported in up to 31% of infants with prenatal UTD; however prenatal UTD correlates poorly with severity of VUR.76,77,78,79 The risk of VUR in patients with a non-dilated or a mildly dilated collecting system may be as high as 25%.77,80,81 Fortunately, VUR associated with prenatally detected UTD has a high incidence of spontaneous resolution.81,82 Studies that assessed whether or not patients with both UTD and VUR are at increased risk for UTI (compared to UTD in the absence of VUR) show conflicting results.83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90 Judicious performance of VCUG should be considered based on risk factors for clinically significant VUR.\n\nThe utility of sibling screening for reflux is also controversial.17,91 there is an increased risk of renal cortical abnormalities in screened siblings with history of UTI as well as ultimate diagnosis of high grade VUR.92 One study using insurance claims data did not find a significant difference in the rate of UTI between screened and unscreened siblings.93\n\nIt remains to be demonstrated whether detection and management of VUR in an asymptomatic screened sibling will result in significantly decreased adverse sequelae; therefore, no consensus regarding the practice of asymptomatic sibling screening for VUR currently exists. The AUA Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Primary Vesicoureteral Reflux in Children recommendation is that siblings be screened with a renal-bladder ultrasound (RBUS), with VCUG reserved for those in whom the RBUS is abnormal.94\n\nTiming of evaluation for VUR in patients with history of febrile UTI also remains controversial. The AAP Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection published clinical guidelines in 2011 and reaffirmed in 2016 that recommended deferring antibiotic prophylaxis and VCUG after the first febrile UTI in the absence of an abnormal renal ultrasound in children aged 2-24 months.95 The Randomized Intervention in Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) trial studied 607 young children (2-72 months) with grades I-IV VUR after a first or second febrile or symptomatic UTI, and randomized them to placebo versus antibiotic prophylaxis. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis reduced the occurrence of UTI by 50%, but there was no significant difference in renal scarring between the groups, although the study was not powered to address renal scarring.96 A post hoc analysis of the RIVUR trial and another multicenter prospective trial (CUTIE) showed the incidence of renal scarring after one febrile UTI to be 2.8%, 25.7% after two febrile UTIs, and 28.6% after three or more febrile UTIs, reinforcing the utility of VUR screening after initial febrile UTI.97\n\nClinical Management\n\nThere is no universal optimal management for children with VUR. As previously noted, multiple anatomic and physiologic variables influence the likelihood of spontaneous VUR resolution and risk of febrile UTIs, while extrinsic factors such as patient and family preferences, medication compliance, social situations and risk of urinary tract infection rates must also be considered. Keeping in mind that the management of VUR should be individualized to each child after consideration of the multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors which influence outcome, we discuss the various treatment options below.\n\nNonoperative Management\n\nDaily administration of low-dose (~ ¼ treatment dose) antibiotics is based on the knowledge that spontaneous resolution rates for primary VUR are very high (even for severe VUR in selected populations), and that postnatal reflux-associated renal scarring appears to occur exclusively in the setting of infected urine, particularly in the poles of the kidneys where the intrarenal collecting system is more likely to have compound calyces.98 Thus, maintenance of sterile urine until spontaneous reflux resolution may avoid the morbidity of surgery and renal scarring. A number of randomized studies have attempted to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with VUR.4,99 These studies have generally failed to show a significant reduction in acute pyelonephritis or renal scars in children with VUR being treated with antibiotic prophylaxis. Some studies actually reported an increase in UTIs in children on antibiotics as well as an increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria causing the UTIs.4,99,100 By subset analysis, other studies identified younger age and increasing degrees of reflux as risk factors for recurrent febrile UTIs.99,101 The multisite RIVUR trial demonstrated a reduction in UTI recurrence by 50% with antibiotic prophylaxis vs. placebo but no difference in the rate of renal scarring.102\n\nMany question the need for antibiotic prophylaxis, suggesting that, in select individuals, the chance for pyelonephritis and renal damage off prophylactic antibiotics is small.103,104,105,106 Between 30% and 50% of children with a history of one UTI will suffer from recurrent infections and because the diagnosis of reflux often follows a urinary tract infection, it leads many individuals to the erroneous assumption that the reflux is responsible for the infection. However, in general it does not significantly predispose to urinary tract infections unless it is of a higher grade.104,107 More often, UTIs are due to predisposing conditions such as a previous history of urinary tract infections, female gender, constipation, infrequent voiding, incomplete bladder emptying, or impaired immunity. Multiple studies now demonstrate that children on antibiotic prophylaxis without breakthrough infections or evidence of renal injury can be safely observed without antibiotic prophylaxis or correction of VUR.103,104 especially after bowel and bladder dysfunction has been optimized.108\n\nIn general, daily antibiotic prophylaxis appears to be safe and well tolerated, but it does incur cost and potential risks. It has been associated with a 24-fold increased risk of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant Escherichia coli.109 Other studies have demonstrated the emergence of other bacteria with high rates of resistance in children receiving prophylactic antibiotics.110 In addition to resistance, there are other concerns regarding potential side effects of long term antibiotics on the gut and urinary microbiome, as well as growth.111,112,113,114 Additionally, medication adherence should be considered. A 2010 study suggested that the compliance rate for merely filling the prescription was only 40%, suggesting that many patients placed on antibiotic prophylaxis never receive the medication.115\n\nRecognition and treatment of bladder dysfunction plays a large role in conservative management of VUR whether in isolation or with antibiotic prophylaxis. It is now recognized that secondary VUR is more appropriately managed by addressing the lower urinary tract dysfunction.116\n\nSeveral large prospective studies have attempted to address the efficacy of operative intervention versus antibiotic prophylaxis. These studies have generally shown no significant difference in renal function or growth, the progression or development of new scars, or UTIs.23,36,107,117,118 However, pyelonephritic symptoms, including febrile UTIs, tended to be more common in the medically treated groups.18,105,119 In general, children who ultimately underwent surgical intervention tended to develop renal scars at an earlier age, but no significant difference occurred overall with longer follow-up in terms of new renal scars in those treated with antibiotics compared to operatively.24,120 These observations suggested that a potential benefit might be a reduction in pyelonephritis from the antireflux operations for some patients; however, other researchers suggested that, once renal scarring occurs, the disease tends to run its course and operative treatment has little benefit.27,121 One review concluded that nine ureteral reimplantation surgeries would be required to prevent one febrile UTI, with no reduction in the number of children developing renal damage,24 again reinforcing the need to better define which children with VUR may benefit from intervention. Operative intervention is generally reserved for children with breakthrough UTI while on antibiotic prophylaxis, worsening renal function, or those in whom other considerations favor definitive intervention over daily antibiotic administration.\n\nOperative Management\n\nEndoscopic Treatment\n\nSince FDA approval of the use of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Dx/HA) (Deflux®, Q-Med, Uppsala, Sweden) in 2001 for the treatment of primary VUR, providers have increasingly used endoscopic injection as an alternative to prolonged antibiotics.122 Dx/HA is the only FDA approved commercially available injectable treatment for reflux in the United States. It is a synthetic mixture of dextran microspheres in a hyaluronic acid gel that is injected using various templates in the region of the ureteral orifices. The dextranomer particle size prevents lymphatic migration.123\n\nEndoscopic correction of VUR offers a minimally invasive, outpatient procedure with low risk of complications. While it is a seemingly simple procedure, several studies have demonstrated a learning curve with improved results obtained with increasing experience.124,125,126 Other factors associated with successful endoscopic correction include lower reflux grade, smaller UDR, absence of bowel and bladder dysfunction, increased volume of Dx/HA injected, visual assessment of mound configuration following injection, and surgical technique.126,127,128,129 Studies of surgical technique have shown that the double hydrodistention implantation technique (HIT) enables higher success rates than other techniques including the STING technique, approaching that of ureteral reimplantation.130\n\nIn the short term, VUR resolution rates for a single ureter treated with Dx/HA range from 59% to 95%.126,131 If patients undergo a second injection for persistent VUR, the success rate is improved, but a third injection is rarely curative.122,124,132 Long-term outcomes of patients with &gt;5 years of follow up show VUR resolution rates anywhere from 59-100%, affected significantly by degree of VUR, with rates of febrile UTI after injection ranging from 4-25%.130 Routine VCUG to confirm VUR resolution is controversial and not considered to be a requirement by some unless a patient is considered high risk for recurrence (high grade VUR, presence of febrile UTI after injection, age &lt; 2 years) or if it is family or surgeon preference.133 Others advocate selectively obtaining VCUG only if a mound is not visualized on ultrasound. Ultrasound should be obtained post-operatively to rule out ureteral obstruction.134\n\nAside from treatment failure, calcification of the implant secondary to a foreign body reaction has recently been reported as another potential long-term factor. Mound calcification is not unique to Dx/HA and has been described with many endoscopically injected agents.135,136 Calcification can be confused with ureterolithiasis, and providers must maintain a high level of suspicion for this entity to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests and surgical interventions.137 Ureteral obstruction following Dx/HA is reported infrequently (&lt; 1%) and can occur shortly after surgery but has also been reported up to five years postoperatively, underscoring the importance of continued radiographic follow up of patients following Deflux. Obstruction can be asymptomatic, present with renal colic or urinary tract infection.138,139 Obstruction typically requires ureteral reimplantation with excision of the affected segment.139,140,141\n\nUreteral Reimplantation\n\nSurgical treatment of vesicoureteral reflux has evolved over the last five decades. A lower abdominal transverse incision for an open technique is typically used, leaving a small scar in the skin crease that is inconspicuous. Numerous operative techniques for ureteral reimplantation have been utilized; the primary differences include intravesical (Figure 8) vs. extravesical approach. There is no clear documentation of any of particular technique being superior,23 and selection of a given technique is typically individualized to the child at the discretion of the operating physician.\n\n\nFigure 8 Intravesical ureteral reimplantation\n\nAdvancements in analgesia, surgical techniques, and the understanding that children undergoing ureteral reimplantation for primary VUR rarely need ureteral stents or prolonged bladder drainage has improved the length of stay and decreased the morbidity of the procedure.142 Several series report patients undergoing both intravesical and extravesical ureteral reimplantation surgery as outpatients.143,144,145 Results of multiple series document success rates with open ureteral reimplantation of greater than 95% and close to 100% for lower grades of reflux.146,147,148 The procedures do carry risks of anesthesia and potential complications including ureteral obstruction, persistent reflux, infection and bleeding.23 General tenets of ureteral reimplantation include minimizing ureteral handling, excision of the intravesical ureteral segment, development of a tunnel at least five times the diameter of the ureteral lumen, and creation of a tension-free anastomosis. In large ureters, tailoring through either excision or plication may be necessary to facilitate achievement of an adequate intravesical tunnel.\n\nIn recent years robotic-assisted laparoscopic extravesical ureteral reimplant has been increasingly used, with cited benefits of decreased pain and shorter postoperative stay.149 One multi-institutional study of 260 patients showed radiographic resolution of VUR in 88% of patients, a 9.6% overall complication rate and 4% rate of urinary retention following bilateral reimplant.150 A nationwide data analysis showed increased rates of complications (13% vs. 4.5%) and increased costs compared to open procedures.151 Although use of robotic ureteral reimplantation continues as some centers, the use of open surgery remains the most prevalent.152\n\nIn patients in whom surgical intervention is considered, timing of elective surgery remains a matter of debate. Most studies evaluating spontaneous resolution rates for VUR have followed patients for 5 years. Although this endpoint is presumably based on the fact that the likelihood of de novo reflux nephropathy declines after age five,153 many clinicians and families infer that children who have failed to resolve their reflux by that time should undergo corrective surgery. However, in children without infections, timing of surgery can often be delayed; ureteral reimplantations in post-pubertal children and adults have been reported, with modifications in surgical technique owing to the differences in body habitus between adults and children, but with generally good outcomes.154\n\nIndividualized Management\n\nWhile VUR itself can be simply defined, more detailed research confirms that reflux is not a single condition but rather occurs with wide variations in severity and impact. The answers to many questions regarding reflux remain unknown; however, it is clear that definitive treatment and even diagnosis of VUR is of questionable clinical benefit for many patients. Currently, decisions regarding treatment are based on physician and parent assessment of risks and benefits. Although the decision to pursue surgery has traditionally been based predominantly on the grade of reflux, a truly informed decision must consider multiple other variables, such as patient age, gender, history of UTI, renal functional status, likeliness and timing of spontaneous resolution, and risk of subsequent febrile UTI. Multiple prognostic factors relative to a child’s chance for spontaneous reflux resolution have been defined.38,47,50,65 A patient’s social situation and parental preferences, as well as willingness to comply with either conservative management or postoperative care, must also be taken into consideration.\n\nAttempting to determine the likelihood and timing of spontaneous VUR resolution in a particular child while taking into account multiple prognostic variables such as age, gender, grade of VUR, ureteral diameter ratio (UDR), bladder volume at onset of reflux, presence of dysfunctional voiding, history of UTIs, presence of renal scarring, laterality and duplication is extremely complex. To this end, a user-friendly neural network that incorporates many of these predictive factors is available for use at http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu (Figure 9)155\n\n\nFigure 9 Neural network incorporating predictive factors for resolution of VUR\n\nThe use and accuracy of this model was validated on an international basis in a group of Japanese children.66 For children who have had a renal scan, a second computer model was generated incorporating the additional renal scan data to improve prognostic accuracy and is available at the same website (http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu).50\n\nFuture Directions\n\nAlthough improved accuracy regarding the likelihood and timing of spontaneous VUR resolution permits better management decisions, additional data is needed. Further studies are needed to define an individual child’s risk of subsequent pyelonephritis, renal damage, and ultimately clinical sequelae. Continued data collection from large, multi-institutional prospective registries can allow for better understanding of the natural history of VUR. Additionally, biomarkers for detection of clinically meaningful vesicoureteral reflux may allow us to better determine those who most benefit from active treatment.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Although the International Reflux Grading System is predictive for spontaneous resolution of VUR and for presence of renal scarring, it has poor interrater reliability. More objective radiographic measures in addition to grade such as distal ureteral diameter ratio and bladder volume at onset of VUR are predictive for spontaneous resolution and risk of breakthrough UTI.\n  Multiple clinical and radiographic factors found to be predictive of clinical VUR outcomes are used in a variety of combinations in risk calculators and user-friendly neural networks such as http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu to permit a more accurate individualized risk assessment in order to better manage patients.\n  Children with renal scarring associated with VUR are more likely to develop hypertension, proteinuria and CKD and should undergo routine surveillance of blood pressure, renal function studies and urinalysis for proteinuria through adulthood.\n  VCUG based on the presence of prenatal urinary tract dilation alone is often not clinically useful and a shared decision-making approach with the parents that incorporates the risk for UTI based on additional clinical and sonographic factors (i.e. severity of hydronephrosis, presence of hydroureter) is recommended to determine if a child should undergo VCUG\n  Adequate control of bowel and bladder dysfunction plays a crucial role in the conservative management of vesicoureteral reflux with or without the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, and can in some cases obviate the need for surgical intervention.\n  Aside from the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, chronic antibiotic prophylaxis may have long-term side-effects including adverse impacts on the normal gut and urinary microbiome which may influence childhood growth and development.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nMathews R, Carpenter M, Chesney R.

        "title": "Megaureter",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nCongenital anomalies of the ureterovesical junction (UVJ) often present with a dilated or ‘mega’-ureter (Figure 1). Many synonyms for this condition exist, including hydroureter and megaloureter, but all represent a ureter with a diameter larger than normal with or without associated renal pelvis dilatation. Smith classified megaureters into four categories, obstructed, refluxing, refluxing with obstruction, and non-refluxing/non-obstructing, later subdivided into primary and secondary by King.1,2 The Pfister-Hendren classification, established in 1978, was based on the morphological appearance: type I involved the distal ureter without associated hydronephrosis; type II extended to both ureter and pelvis; and type III was associated with severe hydroureteronephrosis and ureteric tortuosity.3 Congenital megaureters are twice as common in males, and present with a left-to-right ratio of 1.8:1.4 As the refluxing UVJ anomaly is discussed in detail elsewhere, the focus of this chapter will be the obstructed, and non-obstructed non-refluxing, megaureters.\n\n\nFigure 1 Intra-operative view of megaureter (MU) and narrowed, aperistaltic juxta-vesical segment (AS).\n\nThe definition of a dilated ureter is not well established in the literature. Cussen examined ureters of fetuses over 20 weeks’ gestation and children up to the age of 12 years and established mean ureteral dimensions for fetuses at 30 weeks’ gestation, and for infants and children at 3 months and 3, 6, and 12 years.5 The upper limit of the range of diameter of the mid-section of the ureter from birth to 12 years was 0.5–0.65 cm; therefore, the upper limit of normal was regarded as closely approximating 0.7 cm. Hellstrom et al provided radiological data of normal ureteric diameter in 194 children aged 0 to16 years, and also came to the conclusion that a ureteric diameter over 7 mm was abnormal in this age group.6\n\nEmbryology and Genetics of the Ureterovesical Junction\n\nUVJ anomalies form part of the congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). CAKUT includes a spectrum of anomalies affecting urinary tract development, including renal agenesis, dysplasia or hypoplasia; proximal or distal ureteric obstruction (ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) or UVJ obstruction); dilatation of the ureter (megaureter); vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and urethral obstruction (e.g., due to posterior urethral valves or urethral atresia).7 Embryologically, the mammalian kidney derives from two components: the ureteric bud, an epithelium that branches recurrently to form the collecting ducts, and the metanephric mesenchyme. The ureteric bud also gives rise to the epithelium of the renal pelvis and ureter, which is known as the urothelium.\n\nTo date, our knowledge of normal ureteral development is limited to work on animal models including transgenic mice with abnormal renal/ ureteral phenotypes. These studies suggest that several genes, transcription factors, as well as secreted proteins, contribute to normal ureteral development, that when deranged, manifest various forms of CAKUT.8 A key player in ureteric development is the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and the transmembrane c-ret protein tyrosine kinase (GDNF/c-ret) axis.9 Ureteric bud sprouting and branching is dependent on the interaction between GDNF and its co-receptor glycosyl-phosphaditylinositol-anchored co-receptor 1 (Gfrα1), which bind to and activate c-ret. GDNF is primarily expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme, the trigonal wedge of the distal ureter and the urogenital sinus. In c-ret -/-mutants, renal agenesis, severe hypodysplasia and blind-ending ureters were observed; GDNF -/- and Gfrα1 -/- mutants were also found to have similar phenotypes, suggesting that the GDNF-c-ret axis is required for ureteric bud initiation and early branching morphogenesis.\n\nC-ret expression is retinoic acid (a metabolite of Vitamin A) dependent.9 Batourina et al showed that Vitamin A and the Ret proto-oncogene are required for formation of a proper connection between the bladder and ureter.10 Mouse mutants lacking Ret or Rara and Rarb, two retinoid receptor family members, had hydronephrosis and megaureter, both of which were linked to defects at early stages of ureter maturation, when “common nephritic duct” (CND—the name given by Batourina et al to the part of the mesonephric duct proximal to the origin of the ureteric bud) remodeling induces ureteric orifices to separate from the mesonephric ducts. Their studies suggested that Vitamin A and Ret were required for the expansion of the CND into a structure called the wedge, which they proposed was the likely precursor of the trigone.11,12\n\nThe timing of smooth muscle differentiation in the distal ureter is unknown, but may be key to understanding why VUR or obstruction improve postnatally. Pirker et al studied bladder specimens form porcine fetuses, newborn and 6-month old piglets.13 They found that at 60 days, bladder detrusor muscle was well-developed and innervated, whereas the intra- and extra-vesical ureter had only just started to differentiate. At day 90, the extravesical ureter was well-innervated, but the intravesical ureter did not mature until after birth. All smooth muscle components showed a striking increase in bulk between neonatal and later sections. The time-course of muscular development in this study correlates with findings in humans, in whom smooth muscle bundles of the extramural ureter first appear in weeks 17 to 22 of gestation, and ureteral muscle development proceeds in a craniocaudal direction.14 The authors also noticed that periureteral sheath development precedes ureteral smooth muscle development, which was also reported in humans. The periureteral sheath showed considerable postnatal neuromuscular development. Its muscle fibers grew significantly, and almost formed a continuous layer at 6 months.13 Tanagho also observed that the distal ureter is the last portion to develop its muscular coat, and that early muscular differentiation is primarily of the circular muscles . Other studies have suggested possible explanations for the development of UVJ obstruction.15 These include a thick sleeve of muscle around the distal portion of the ureter, increased deposition of collagen fibres and dysregulated neuromodulation in the juxtavesical segment of obstructed megaureters.11,16,17\n\nPrenatal Diagnosis\n\nUreteral dilation is associated with antenatal hydronephrosis in 5–10% of cases.18 Currently, nearly 79% of patients with hydroureteronephrosis present on perinatal ultrasound scan (USS), with the remainder presenting after a febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).19 The detection of a dilated ureter in-utero by ultrasound is a difficult endeavor. The fetus may not be in the proper orientation, or the ureter may be obscured by overlying structures or maternal bowel gas. Furthermore, technicians may not be trained to specifically look for dilated ureters on routine screening. As a result, the prenatal detection of dilated ureters is likely to be unreliable. In a study of 101 patients with postnatally-identified hydroureteronephrosis referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital, only 20% had a dilated ureter documented prenatally. Forty-eight (47.5%) infants were found to have VUR or other pathology, and 53 (52.5%) were suspected of having a UVJ obstruction.4\n\nPostnatal management\n\nPatients with ureteral dilation over 7mm are at increased risk for urinary tract infection (UTI) and thus continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) is recommended.20 A recent prospective multi-center study of 237 patients with ureteral dilation concluded that patients with ureters 7 mm or greater had nearly three times the risk of UTI adjusting for sex, circumcision status, antibiotic prophylaxis and hydronephrosis grade. The higher risk was also present in patients investigated with a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and found not to have VUR. CAP was significantly protective against UTI.21\n\nA postnatal ultrasound (US) scan is recommended between 48 hours and 4 weeks (UTD consensus), where the dilatation is unilateral (Figure 2).22 Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis should be investigated more urgently, and bladder outlet obstruction excluded prior to postnatal discharge. Presence of a dilated ureter(s) is an indication for a VCUG, in order to exclude urethral obstruction or VUR. The presence of VUR confirms a “refluxing megaureter”. It is important to ensure upper tract drainage following bladder emptying on the MCUG. Poor drainage on VCUG, especially where there is significant upper tract dilatation on USS, may raise the suspicion of a “refluxing and obstructive” megaureter.20\n\n\nFigure 2 Ultrasound appearance of a dilated ureter, seen exiting a dilated renal pelvis (a) and visible behind the bladder (b)\n\nIn the absence of VUR or urethral obstruction, a dynamic renogram, such as 99mTc-MAG-3 diuretic renography, and a repeat ultrasound scan should be performed after 6 weeks of age. These investigations will assist with differentiating between an “obstructive”, or “non-obstructive-non-refluxing”, megaureter. Babies presenting postnatally (e.g., with a UTI) are also investigated in a similar fashion, although it is best to wait for recovery from urosepsis before embarking on a VCUG or MAG-3 renogram.20\n\nAccording to the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) guidelines for standard and diuretic renography in children, renography allows estimation of two aspects of renal function.23 The first aspect is renal clearance, or differential renal function (DRF). DRF estimation is best undertaken between one and two minutes after tracer injection. The second aspect is the excretion, or disappearance, of the tracer from the kidney. Traditionally, an important delay in excretion is suggested by a continuously ascending curve and delayed transit, i.e. a Tmax (time to reach the maximum, or peak, of the curve) over 20 minutes (Figure 3). However, delayed transit may be caused by the increased capacity afforded by a dilated pelvis and ureter. Hence, furosemide is administered in order to distinguish between obstruction of the effect of a dilated system. Poor drainage may also be apparent because the bladder is full, or because the effect of gravity on drainage is incomplete. For all these reasons, the interpretation of “impaired drainage” on diuretic renography is controversial.24\n\n\nFigure 3 MAG-3 images showing delayed drainage of tracer (red curve) at 20 minutes (a) and visible left (L) ureter on delayed imaging (b), suggesting a hold-up at the left UVJ.\n\nA combination of clinical and radiological findings must be taken into account when designating a megaureter as “obstructed” or “non-obstructed”. The presence of symptoms, such as febrile UTI, or pain, are clinical indicators of possible obstruction. In the asymptomatic patient, the presence of a DRF below 40%, and/or increasing dilatation on serial ultrasound scans, are also suggestive of obstruction and indications for intervention. Delayed transit on MAG-3 in the presence of stable or improving dilatation, and a DRF above 40%, in an asymptomatic patient, may be managed conservatively.20 Liu et al and McLellan et al suggested that children with a retrovesical ureteral diameter greater than 10 mm were more likely to require surgical intervention.4,25\n\nIt is important to be aware that ipsilateral UPJ and UVJ obstruction may co-exist. The pre-operative MAG-3 may suggest dual pathology when the obstructed ureter fills slowly then fails to drain. In this scenario, a retrograde pyelogram can be helpful in making a diagnosis.26\n\nManagement\n\nManagement of primary megaureters has changed over the past 30 years. In 1989, Peters et al reported that 89% of patients required surgery before 8 months of age.27 That same year, Keating et al reported that when the decision to intervene was based on absolute renal function, up to 87% of patients could be followed up conservatively.28 A further publication from the same unit confirmed stability or improvement at long-term follow-up of the same group of patients who managed conservatively.29 Liu et al also suggested that the majority of megaureters may be followed up conservatively, and showed that at a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, 34% of primary megaureters resolved spontaneously. Of the remaining cases, 17% were re-implanted due to break-through infection or deteriorating renal function, whereas 49% had persistent dilatation at follow-up, and were still being monitored conservatively.4\n\nNon-Obstructed Non-Refluxing Megaureters\n\nMegaureters associated with a DRF &gt;40% in an asymptomatic patient, may be managed conservatively. Close follow-up with interval USS and antibiotic prophylaxis are recommended, especially where the ureteral dilation is over 7mm21 Song et al showed that the risk of UTI is higher with UVJ than UPJ obstruction, and that UTIs tend to occur within the first six months of life.30 Once the hydronephrosis is noted to be improving, follow-up appointments may be reduced to six-monthly and then annually, and antibiotic prophylaxis discontinued. Resolution of the hydroureteronephrosis may take several years. McLellan et al showed that hydronephrosis had resolved completely in 72% of cases at a median follow-up of 25.8 months.25\n\nLong-term follow-up is advisable where dilatation is persistent. A long-term follow-up study by Shukla et al reported late deterioration in a 14-year old boy with bilateral primary megaureters, who presented with increased dilatation and functional deterioration six years after he was discharged from conservative follow-up.31 Hemal et al. 30 reported the outcome of 55 patients with congenital megaureters presenting for the first time in the third decade of life, of whom 20 patients were found to have renal calculi. Five patients with bilateral megaureters were in chronic renal failure at diagnosis, of whom two eventually died of the disease.32 Hence early resolution following conservative management is not a life-long guarantee, and follow-up into adulthood is advisable.\n\nObstructed Megaureters\n\nObstruction is diagnosed based on a reduced DRF &lt;40% at diagnosis, or a drop in DRF &gt;10% on repeated interval renography. Increasing dilatation on USS, and symptoms (UTI/pain) are also suggestive of obstruction. The choice of surgical intervention depends on the age of the child (below or over 1 year), and availability of equipment and expertise where an endoscopic option is considered. Surgical options include:\n\n\n  Ureteral re-implantation (open/ laparoscopic or robotic-assisted)\n  Temporary JJ-stenting\n  Endoscopic balloon dilatation ± endoureterotomy\n  Refluxing ureterocystotomy\n  Cutaneous ureterostomy\n\n\nUreteral Reimplantation\n\nThe aim of ureteral re-implantation is to excise the aperistaltic, narrow UVJ segment, and tunnel the ureter into the bladder in an anti-reflux fashion. The tunnel should be at least five times the ureteral diameter to be effective, data based on a study by Paquin in 1959.33 In order to obtain this ratio when the ureteral diameter is above 10 mm, the distal 10 cm of the ureter may need to be tapered. A psoas hitch may also be required in order to ensure a straight entry of the ureter into the bladder. The two most popular techniques used for tailoring megaureters are plication as reported by Starr and Kalicinski et al., and tapering as modified by Hendren.34,35,36 Kalicinski et al described a folding technique whereby the lateral, avascular part of the ureter was excluded from the lumen by a longitudinal running suture, and then folded posteriorly prior to re-implantation. Starr modified this procedure, introducing many interrupted Lembert sutures that folded the ureteral wall inwards, thus preserving its blood supply, but making the subsequent re-implantation more cumbersome. Hendren advised excisional tapering, whereby a longitudinal strip of the redundant ureter is excised, and the ureter sutured in two layers.35,36 Ben-Meir et al compared the outcome of megaureter reimplantation with and without tailoring, and showed that there was no significant difference in outcome (94% success rate in the tailored group, and 96% in the non-tailored group).37 An example of reimplantation with tapering is provided in (Figure 4 and Figure 5).\n\n\nFigure 4 Intraoperative view of a megaureter with aperistaltic segment and proximal dilation.\n\n\nFigure 5 Intraoperative view of same ureter from Figure 4 after tapering over a 10 Fr catheter. It was subsequently reimplanted by creating a cross-trigonal tunnel, passing it through the tunnel and securing it. A ureteral stent was left in place for 2 weeks.\n\nAn extravesical Lich–Gregoir reimplantation is commonly preferred when laparoscopic or robotic-assisted (RALUR) techniques are used.38,39,40 The dilated ureter is identified below the iliac vessels, and the peritoneum dissected along the ureter to the level of the crossing of the vas deferens. The ureter is mobilized with blunt dissection to minimize the risk of nervous and blood supply injuries, and is then transected at the level of stenosis. The sero-muscular tunnel is marked out using hook electrocautery and then the detrusor fibers are sharply divided with scissors until the bladder mucosa bulges freely. Vesical mucosa is opened at the end of the tunnel and the ureterovesical anastomosis is performed with interrupted sutures. The ureter is then installed into the tunnel, which is approximated by continuous or interrupted sutures.\n\nVUR resolution rates after extravesical RALUR reported in the literature range from 66.7 to 100% in multiple relatively small series.40 Overall success upon pooling these series is 91%. A multi-institutional retrospective study reported radiographic resolution in 87.9% of 280 ureters. More recently, a large prospective multi-institutional study reported 93.8% resolution in 199 ureters.40 RALUR may be performed bilaterally; however, there is concern that bilateral dissection of the posterior bladder may disrupt the pelvic nerve plexus, resulting in higher rates of postoperative urinary retention. Nerve-sparing dissection has been proposed to reduce this complication. In 2008, Casale et al reported a 97.6% success rate following bilateral nerve-sparing RALUR in 41 patients.41 There were no complications or instances of urinary retention. Herz et al reported a 91.7% success rate for unilateral RALUR but a success rate of only 77.8% of ureters (72.2% of children) for bilateral cases. In this study, complication rates (including ureteral obstruction, readmission, and urinary retention) were higher for bilateral cases. A nerve-sparing technique was not utilized.42\n\nUreteric reimplantation in infants below one year of age may be challenging due to the discrepancy between the grossly-dilated ureter and the small infantile bladder, and concern regarding possible iatrogenic bladder dysfunction. De Jong et al investigated the bladder functional outcome of 49 neonates and infants with primary obstructive or refluxing megaureters, who underwent a Politano-Leadbetter procedure, at a mean follow-up of 7.3 years.43 No onset of voiding dysfunction was noted at follow-up, and bladder capacity for age was significantly increased. No post-operative ureteral obstruction was observed. The author concluded that early major reconstructions of the lower urinary tract do not damage the urodynamic properties of the bladder and pelvic floor, provided that the surgery is performed by specialized pediatric urological surgeons. A further study from the same group 41 compared urodynamic outcome in patients who underwent ureteral reimplantation before, or after, one year of age. No significant difference in bladder capacity, compliance, or incidence of instability, was found.44\n\nTemporary JJ Stenting\n\nIn 1999, Shenoy and Rance reported of the use of JJ stents as a temporizing measure in infants with primary obstructive megaureters.45 The procedure involves the insertion of a double pigtail stent, endoscopically where possible. A tight UVJ obstruction may preclude endoscopic insertion, in which case an open insertion via a cystostomy combined with dilatation of the ureteric orifice using a lachrymal probe may be performed. Stents are licensed to remain in-situ for six months, following which, they should be removed or replaced. The megaureter should be stented until the baby is over one year of age, by which time a ureteric reimplantation may be safely performed, if the dilatation has not resolved.45 The baby should remain on prophylactic antibiotics while the stent is in-situ, due to the risk of stent infection, and should be monitored by ultrasonography to ensure decompression of the system, and to check stent position.46 An ultrasound scan and MAG-3 renography performed three months after removal of stent will direct further management. In the presence of improved dilatation and drainage, and preserved function, no further intervention may be required. Persistent or worsening dilatation after a period of stenting, or further infection, is an indication for ureteric reimplantation. A long-term outcome study revealed that in 56% of cases, no further intervention was required after removal of the stent. However, two-thirds of patients required open stent insertion, and one-third suffered complications (migration, stone formation and infection).47\n\nEndoscopic Balloon Dilatation\n\nEndoscopic management has become accepted as a less invasive option for treatment. Advantages of the endoscopic approach include a minimally-invasive approach, no manipulation of the distal ureteral blood supply, and no need for prolonged catheterization.48 Furthermore, if endoscopic management should fail, ureteral reimplantation can still be performed. However, the potential need for a second anesthetic for stent removal must be factored into discussions regarding the risks of the endoscopic approach. The procedure is performed using a pediatric rigid cystoscope (8F–10.5F) and a flexible guidewire is placed up into the renal pelvis. For high-pressure balloon dilatation (HPBD), a balloon catheter (usually 3F–5F, 2–4 cm balloon length, 3–7 mm inflated balloon diameter) is used to dilate the ureterovesical junction, followed by placement of a Double-J ureteral stent. For incisional ureterotomy, both Kajbafzadeh et al and Shirazi and et al perform incisions at the 6 o’clock position.49,50,51\n\nDoudt et al published a systematic review of the long-term outcome of endoscopic management.48 Eleven retrospective and 1 prospective, single institution case series were analyzed. Mean age at time of surgery was 24.6 months (range 3–84). Initial attempts at endoscopic management were not effective in 10.5%, either because of an inability to pass the stent endoscopically, or difficulty with advancement of the pediatric cystoscope through the urethra. Effectively completed endoscopic approaches were cystoscopy+high-pressure balloon dilation (HPBD)+ Double-J ureteral stent placement in 49.5%, cystoscopy+incisional ureterotomy+Double-J ureteral stent placement in 27.8%, cystoscopy+Double-J ureteral stent placement in 18.9% and cystoscopy+HPBD+ incisional ureterotomy+Double-J ureteral stent placement in 3.7%. Mean stent duration was 2.3 months (range 0.25–6). At a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, initial success rate was 76.7%. Endoscopic re-treatment was performed in 15.1% of cases with a 36.7% overall surgical re-intervention rate. The authors concluded that endoscopic management for persistent or progressive POM in children &gt;12 months of age is a minimally invasive alternative to ureteral reimplantation with modest success rates. In infants, it may best be utilized as a temporizing procedure. Approximately one-third of patients require surgical re-intervention.48\n\nRefluxing Re-Implantation\n\nKaefer proposed a novel approach for managing obstructing megaureters in infants, performed in two stages.52 The first stage remedies the obstruction without the concern of creating an anti-reflux mechanism, by simply dividing the ureter proximal to the obstruction and performing an end-to-side refluxing anastomosis to the bladder; then, as the bladder size increases during infancy, the second stage is performed, a standard tapered ureteral reimplantation with creation of an anti-reflux valve mechanism.52,53 Alyami et al published their experience with the refluxing reimplantation approach in 32 patients with distal ureteral obstruction diagnosed antenatally.54 Mean age at surgery was 3.7 months (range 0 to 33) and mean follow-up was 34.3 months (range 6 to 58). A circumcision was also performed in most of the males. Of 32 patients, 86% demonstrated significant improvement in dilation. Six patients underwent further procedures, including a circumcision and 2 ureteral reimplantations for recurrent infections. The authors concluded that despite the trade-off of relieving obstruction by creating reflux, this procedure can be considered a potentially definitive intervention in patients who remain infection-free. Close follow-up is critical to document satisfactory long-term results.54\n\nCutaneous Ureterostomy\n\nA temporary cutaneous ureterostomy remains a safe and effective option, especially in the presence of urosepsis, or where endoscopic technology is not available. Shrestha et al published the outcome of 25 patients who underwent an end cutaneous ureterostomy (ECU) POM at a mean age of 7 months (range 23 days to 2.5 years). Following diversion, renal failure had resolved in all, and febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) developed in one while awaiting reimplantation.55 No stomal complications were reported in this study, although others have reported complications, including stomal stenosis and pyelonephritis.56\n\nConclusion\n\nUVJ anomalies, associated with a megaureter, may be obstructive, refluxing, non-obstructed and non-refluxing, or both refluxing and obstructed. Only 10-20% of megaureters require intervention, whilst the remainder may be monitored conservatively. Surgical options include ureteric reimplantation, with or without ureteral tailoring, endoscopic procedures, refluxing ureterneocystostomy or a cutaneous ureterostomy. Persistent dilatation in non-obstructive non-refluxing megaureters is warranted due to the long-term risk of stone-formation.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Beware of the rare refluxing and obstructive megaureter: take note of upper tract drainage after bladder emptying when high-grade VUR is diagnosed on VCUG. In the presence of poor drainage associated with significant upper tract dilatation, a diuretic MAG-3 renogram is indicated. Ureteral reimplantation is the best option in this situation.\n  UVJ and UPJ obstructions can co-exist. Look for discrepancies in renal pelvis and ureteral dilatation, especially where one appears to improve while the other does not. Inspect MAG-3 renogram imaging for drainage at both junctions. Where suspicion is raised, a retrograde pyelogram may assist with the diagnosis. A surgical strategy could be a pyeloplasty with double-J stent insertion in the first instance; followed by further imaging after stent removal.\n  Where conservative management of the non-obstructive non-refluxing megaureter is undertaken, the current literature recommends antibiotic prophylaxis for ureteral dilation over 7mm; the greatest risk of UTI is in the first year of life.\n  Long-term follow-up is advisable in cases where ureteral dilatation does not resolve in childhood, due to the long-term risk of stone-formation or renal functional deterioration in bilateral cases.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFerenci P, Lockwood A, Mullen K, Tarter R, Weissenborn K, Blei AT.

        "content": "Urachal Anomalies\n\nEmbryology and Anatomy\n\nThe urachus is a tubular structure that connects the allantois at the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder and is patent during gestation.1 The lumen normally closes around the twelfth week of gestation and obliterates completely. Following obliteration, all that typically remains is a fibrous cord running from the inferior aspect of the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder. The urachus is extraperitoneal and easily viewed during laparoscopic visualization of the pelvis (Figure 1).\n\n\nFigure 1 Intraperitoneal laparoscopic view of the urachus. The fibrous cord of the urachus (median umbilical ligament) is shown in the midline extending down to the dome of the bladder. The rectum is inferior. The vas deferens can be seen extending laterally just above the rectum.\n\nThe urachus is covered by the folds of peritoneum to form the median umbilical ligament. Rarely, the urachus may have gaps in the fibrous cord or even complete obliteration of the cord. It is an important surgical landmark for marking the dome of the bladder to ensure proper placement of a vesicostomy.\n\nClassification of Urachal Anomalies\n\nUrachal anomalies are due to failure of complete obliteration of the lumen during gestation.2 Their anatomical classification is based on the degree to which the patency of the urachus has persisted and vary from complete patency and free flow of urine to a small blind-ending sinus tract from the skin (Figure 2). A urachal cyst may be present at any location along the length of the urachus but are most commonly found near the bladder dome. A urachal diverticulum—the rarest anomaly reported—is a partial patency of the urachus draining into the dome of the bladder.\n\n\nFigure 2 Diagram illustrating different types of urachal anomalies. A- Normal obliteration of the urachal lumen. B- Urachal cyst. C- Patent urachus. D- Urachal sinus. E- Urachal diverticulum. These anomalies are not mutually exclusive and may occur in combination.\n\nThe relative incidence of the different types of urachal abnormalities from several clinical series are shown in Table 1.3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nTable 1 Summary of the Types and Incidence of Urachal Anomalies presenting in Children.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Author\n      # Pts\n      Cyst\n      Patent\n      Sinus\n      Diverticulum\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Naiditch\n      103\n      38\n      21\n      11\n      13\n    \n    \n      Fox\n      66\n      34\n      14\n      7\n      10\n    \n    \n      Ashley\n      46\n      25\n      6\n      14\n      1\n    \n    \n      Cilento\n      45\n      16\n      7\n      22\n      0\n    \n    \n      Rich\n      35\n      12\n      19\n      4\n      0\n    \n    \n      Yiee\n      31\n      19\n      7\n      5\n      0\n    \n    \n      Copp\n      29\n      7\n      3\n      17\n      2\n    \n    \n      Total\n      355\n      151 (43)\n      108 (30)\n      80 (23)\n      26 (7)\n    \n  \n\n\nInterestingly there is a single case report of a patent urachus that spontaneously closed with 2 weeks of catheter drainage and persisted as a urachal diverticulum.10\n\nClinical Presentation\n\nThe most common presenting symptoms in children with urachal anomalies are umbilical drainage persisting weeks after delivery or a mass and/or pain due to infection.3,6,8,11 The umbilical drainage may be clear, serous, purulent, or bloody and is a clue to its cause: persistent clear fluid leakage (likely urine) in an infant is suggestive of a patent urachus while cloudy, serous, or bloody fluid is indicative of an urachal sinus or cyst. There is a bimodal age distribution with presentation at a mean of 1-3 months of age for those with urachal sinus or patency versus 3 years for those who present with a urachal cyst.8 The differential diagnosis of umbilical drainage also includes omphalitis, omphalomesenteric duct remnant, or an umbilical granuloma.6\n\nTable 2 Presenting Symptoms in Children with Urachal Anomalies.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Author\n      # Pts\n      Drainage\n      Mass/Infection\n      Pain\n      Asymptomatic\n      Other\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Gleason\n      721\n      26\n      19\n      17\n      667\n      0\n    \n    \n      Naiditch\n      103\n      60\n      7\n      4\n      18\n      12\n    \n    \n      Stopak\n      85\n      43\n      36\n      0\n      4\n      1\n    \n    \n      Dethlefs\n      68\n      52\n      32\n      0\n      8\n      0\n    \n    \n      Cilento\n      45\n      19\n      15\n      10\n      0\n      1\n    \n    \n      Yiee\n      37\n      20\n      8\n      4\n      2\n      3\n    \n    \n      Total\n      1059\n      220 (21)\n      117 (11)\n      35 (3)\n      699 (66)\n      17 (2)\n    \n  \n\n\nPhysical examination may also be helpful. A patent urachus or urachal sinus can appear as a dimple or indentation in the base of the umbilicus (Figure 3).\n\n\nFigure 3 Patent urachus in a newborn. A. Demonstrates the beefy red appearance of the umbilical end of a patent urachus. B. The umbilical skin has been everted and a small feeding has been passed through the patent urachus into the bladder.\n\nSome urachal anomalies are incidentally discovered during the routine radiographic evaluation of other disorders, such as urinary tract infections or prenatal hydronephrosis. Urachal cysts are likely to be seen during ultrasound imaging of the bladder (Figure 4).\n\n\nFigure 4 Sagittal view if the dome of the bladder in the midline. There is a large anechoic urachal cyst anterior to the bladder wall.\n\nUrachal Carcinoma\n\nAs urachal carcinoma is not a disease reported to present in children or adolescents, the treatment of this disorder will not be included in this chapter.5,12 As will be discussed in the section on management, the risk of an asymptomatic urachal anomaly developing carcinoma and, thus, the value of prophylactic excision are unknown. Risk factors for carcinoma in a urachal anomaly include size greater than 4 cm and age &gt; 55 years. Calcifications are a common feature in carcinoma, however, the significance of calcifications in an asymptomatic benign urachal remnant is unknown.5,12 It would seem prudent to remove lesions with calcifications, given that calcifications that may be associated with chronic inflammation, which is associated with carcinogenesis.\n\nRadiologic Evaluation\n\nImaging is directed by the presenting symptoms and the degree of clinical suspicion.6,8 A patent urachus that allows urine to drain freely through the umbilicus can be imaged with a high degree of sensitivity with either a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or sinogram. Traditionally a VCUG was performed to identify the patent urachus and also provide an anatomical assessment of the bladder and evaluate for bladder outlet obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux (Figure 5). However, abdominal ultrasound is adequate for diagnosis in most patients, more widely available, less invasive, and less costly; thus, it has become the standard for diagnosis, and VCUG is reserved for complicated cases.3,13 It is important to notify the ultrasonographer of the clinical suspicion for urachal anomaly so the midline abdominal wall is thoroughly examined. Infected urachal cysts appear as large heterogenous masses with complex fluid collections (Figure 6).\n\n\nFigure 5 Lateral filling view from a VCUG in an infant with copious amounts of clear fluid draining from the umbilicus. The image demonstrates contrast draining through the anterior abdominal wall from the dome of the bladder via the patent urachus.\n\n\nFigure 6 Infected urachal cyst. A. Transverse view of the bladder dome in the midline demonstrating a heterogeneous echogenic mass above the bladder. B. CT scan showing the midline mass with central fluid density consistent with an abscess and inflammatory stranding of the adjacent anterior abdominal wall.\n\nThe lesions may be several centimeters in diameter and can, on occasion, spread beyond the pre-peritoneal space and perforate the peritoneal cavity.14,15\n\nCT should not be considered an integral component of the routine workup but can detect anomalies missed by US and thus is useful in cases of high clinical suspicion without clear diagnosis (Figure 7).\n\n\nFigure 7 CT scan in a patient with recurrent bloody umbilical drainage. A. Image just inferior to the umbilicus demonstrates a normal appearing urachus (fibrous cord) just inferior to the rectus muscles in the midline. B. A urachal cyst is demonstrated more inferiorly. C. The proximity of the inferior extent of the cyst and the dome of the bladder is demonstrated.\n\nThe evaluation should also include a renal ultrasound to ensure the absence of hydronephrosis or other congenital kidney anomalies.6,8,9,16  The incidence of concomitant kidney abnormalities has varied widely in published series, but given the lack of morbidity and risk with ultrasound, it is prudent to include imaging the kidneys as part of the work-up.4\n\nTreatment\n\nIn general, symptomatic urachal remnants should be treated with surgical excision. This should include complete excision of the urachus from the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder (Figure 8).\n\n\nFigure 8 Open excision of urachal cyst. A. Intra-operative view of a urachal cyst excision via an infra-umbilical midline incision. The cyst is in center with the bladder attachment to the right, and the fibrous cord extending to the umbilicus on the left. B. The specimen (cyst) after excision with the small cuff of bladder (right end of specimen).\n\nThe necessity of excising bladder mucosa with urachal cysts or sinuses that are not continuous with the bladder wall is debated.2,6,7,17,18 Infected urachal cysts present another dilemma, as the marked enlargement of the cyst due to infection and surrounding inflammation make simple excision more difficult and may increase the risk of complications. One can approach the infected urachal cyst in either a single or staged approach.7,17,19 The relative merits and risks of the two approaches are further discussed below.\n\nSurgical excision of the urachal remnant is curative and there are no functional sequelae from its excision, as it is a vestigial remnant. The main surgical dilemma occurs in patients who present with an asymptomatic lesion that is incidentally discovered in imaging.\n\nConservative Management\n\nThere are limited data regarding the long-term sequelae—namely recurrent infection and development of carcinoma—of urachal anomalies left in situ. Historically, excision was favored given presumed risk of malignant transformation, however, recent publications argue for a conservative approach.10,20 Closure of the patent urachus and regression of urachal cysts—even in the setting of infection—have been reported.21,22,23 Recurrence of symptoms following percutaneous drainage of infected cysts appears to be rare.23 In one series, 92% of infants &lt; 6 months who were observed had resolution of infection, whereas 60% who underwent excision developed a post-operative infection indicating conservative management until at least 6 months of age may be prudent.21\n\nFor infected urachal cysts, urine culture and culture of wound drainage, if present, should be obtained. The most common organism cultured from infected urachal cysts is Staphylococcus aureus (Table 3).5,21,18,20 If the patient is stable, afebrile, non-toxic, without peritoneal signs, spreading cellulitis, or signs of fasciitis, initial management with antibiotics alone can be considered.\n\nTable 3 Microbial Species cultured from Infected Urachal Remnants. * E Coli-3, Citrobacter, Enterococcus, and Proteus.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Author\n      # Pts\n      S.

In the single-stage excision of the infected urachus, the margins of resection will be larger and result in larger soft tissue defect and the extent of the inflammation can extend intraperitoneal, which puts the abdominal viscera at risk. There is a small but significant risk of an enterocutaneous fistula and a higher rate of wound complications after primary excision of an infected urachal cyst compared to drainage.21,18,19,24 Percutaneous drains may incompletely drain multiloculated fluid collections. Traditionally, all cysts were excised following resolution of inflammation in a staged procedure. Several recent studies have demonstrated that recurrent infection is uncommon and, thus, delayed excision may not be required.\n\nLaparoscopic Excision of the Urachus\n\nIn this era of minimally invasive surgery, multiple reports of laparoscopic, and more recently, robotic-assisted laparoscopic resection of urachal remnants in children have emerged.25,26,27 Laparoscopic single site surgery has been reported as well.28 The main advantage of robotic technique is the ease of suturing compared to pure laparoscopy.27 Visualization is excellent with a laparoscopic approach for the bladder but can be more challenging at the umbilicus if the ports are not carefully placed. The urachus should be resected from the base of the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder. Again, there is controversy as to whether or not complete resection requires excision of the dome of the bladder.25,26\n\nPort placement is an important consideration.26  Since the urachus originates at the umbilicus, this cannot be used as a port site. The most common site for the camera is supra-umbilical (usually 1–2 cm). This gives enough working space to visualize the dissection from the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder. Working ports should be placed laterally on either side, usually at the level of the umbilicus. Alternatively, lateral working ports and camera placement (on either the right or left side of the abdomen) offers lateral visualization of the urachus and keeps all the ports infra-umbilical in location. The lateral port configuration will make suturing the bladder closure more difficult due to the angle.\n\n\nFigure 9 Diagram of possible port placement for urachal remnant excision. Unlike the set-up for most laparoscopic surgeries, the umbilicus cannot be used as a port site as it is the origin of the urachus and must be visualized in the dissection.\n\nOpen Excision of the Urachus\n\nIn infants and small children complete resection of the urachus can easily be accomplished through a small incision. It can be oriented in either a transverse or vertical midline. For infants, a small 1-1.5 cm incision midway between the pubis and umbilicus will give access to the urachus and allow complete resection from the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder with excellent exposure of bladder dome for closure. This small incision is comparable to the size of incision needed for the 12 mm camera port of the surgical robot and keeps the procedure entirely extra-peritoneal, eliminating potential intra-abdominal complications. In older or obese children or adolescents, it is prudent to make a vertical midline incision. If there is trouble with exposure, the incision can be extended up toward the umbilicus or down toward the bladder to facilitate complete removal of the urachus in these patients. Complication rates for simple excision are very low and the surgery can either be performed as an outpatient or with a short hospital stay if a catheter is left in place. Urine leaks or wound complications are more commonly associated with single-stage excision of infected cysts and not simple excision.18,19\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Urachal anomalies most commonly present as umbilical drainage persisting weeks after delivery or umbilical mass and/or pain due to infection.\n  The differential diagnosis of umbilical drainage includes urachal anomaly, omphalitis, omphalomesenteric duct remnant, or an umbilical granuloma.\n  The absolute risk of an asymptomatic urachal anomaly developing carcinoma is unknown. Risk factors for carcinoma in a urachal anomaly include size greater than 4 cm and age &gt;55 years.\n  Abdominal ultrasound is adequate for diagnosis of urachal anomaly in most patients. Workup should include renal ultrasound to evaluate for congenital kidney anomalies.\n  Symptomatic urachal remnants should be excised via open, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted approach. If using a laparoscopic or robotic approach, the umbilicus cannot be used as a port site.\n  Uncomplicated infections of urachal cysts can be treated conservatively with antibiotics ± percutaneous drainage. Immediate excision carries significant risk of post-operative infection. Delayed excision is reasonable but may not be necessary as closure of remnants/cyst is possible and recurrent infection rare especially in children &lt;6 months old.\n\n\nProstatic Utricle\n\nEmbryology and Anatomy\n\nIn male fetuses, the production of Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) by Sertoli cells signals the rapid regression of the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts—which in females become the Fallopian tubes, oviduct, uterus, and upper 2/3 of the vagina—in the 8-10th weeks of gestation. The prostatic utricle is a small remnant of the paramesonephric ducts that persists in males as an expansion of the prostatic urethra.1 The utricle arises from the midline of the prostate at the cranial aspect of the verumontanum.\n\nClinical Presentation\n\nProstatic utricles (PU) are not clinically significant unless complete regression was impaired and the utricle maintains a dilated, cystic appearance, acting as a diverticulum of the prostatic urethra. Utricle enlargement is associated with hypospadias, cryptorchidism, disorders of sexual differentiation, and unilateral renal agenesis.29,30,31,32,33,34 Case series indicate PU dilation occurs in 10-33% of patients with proximal hypospadias, with incidence increasing with severity of hypospadias defect.30,32 In one series of boys with normal external genitalia with symptomatic PU, unilateral renal agenesis was found in nearly one-third of cases.33\n\nPU may be asymptomatic, cause symptoms related to obstruction or urinary stasis—recurrent urinary tract infections, epidydimo-orchitis, urethral discharge, retention, stone formation, or post-void dribbling—or may present with abdominal pain, hematuria, or hematospermia.31,33,35 Rarely, malignant transformation has been reported.33,34,36\n\nDilation of the prostatic utricle may impede catheterization of males with hypospadias—difficult catheterization may be the presenting or only symptom of prostatic utricle in these patients. Large utricles may be palpable inferior or posterior to the bladder on digital rectal exam.31,33,35,37\n\nDifferential diagnosis for prostatic utricles includes müllerian duct cyst (not continuous with prostatic urethra), bladder diverticulum, urachal cyst, and seminal vesicle cyst.33,38\n\nTable 4 Presenting symptoms of patients with prostatic utricles\n\n\n  \n    \n      Author\n      # Pts\n      UTI\n      LUTS\n      Retention\n      Epididymitis/ Scrotal pain\n      Other\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Desautel\n      26\n      6\n      1\n      7\n      2\n      1\n    \n    \n      Liu\n      22\n      8\n      7\n      6\n      3\n      6\n    \n    \n      Dai\n      15\n      6\n      2\n      1\n      7\n      4\n    \n    \n      Jia\n      14\n      8\n      1\n      1\n      5\n      3\n    \n    \n      Babu\n      7\n      3\n      2\n      1\n      3\n      1\n    \n    \n      Total\n      84\n      31 (37)\n      13 (15)\n      16 (19)\n      20 (24)\n      5 (6)\n    \n  \n\n\nRadiologic Evaluation\n\nDiagnosis is often established via retrograde urethrogram (RUG) or voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) as these modalities allow visualization of utricle orifice in relation to the urethra and bladder. However, transabdominal ultrasonography is nearly as sensitive as RUG and may be adequate in detecting utricles that are large enough to warrant intervention.30,39 Utricles may be missed on imaging due to incomplete filling. Cross-sectional imaging may be performed and can aid in operative planning but is not necessary for diagnosis. Utricles may be classified on imaging as follows:29\n\n\n  Grade 0 – confined to the verumontanum\n  Grade 1 – extends to or below the bladder neck (Image 1)\n  Grade 2 – extends proximal to the bladder neck (Image 2)\n  Grade 3 – opens distal to the external urethral sphincter\n\n\n\nFigure 10 Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images demonstrating grade 1 (left) and grade 2 (right) prostatic utricles.30,33\n\nManagement\n\nSuccessful conservative management of symptomatic utricles has not been well described and would generally require frequent or long-term prophylactic antibiosis for recurrent infection.33 A variety of successful surgical approaches have been described with complete excision of the utricle offering definitive management. For utricles with very small orifices, transrectal ultrasound guided aspiration and transurethral catheterization and aspiration, orifice incision, and fulguration have been all reported.31,33,35,40 These approaches are minimally invasive but confer higher incidence of symptom recurrence than excision. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted approaches to excision have all been described, and there is no consensus regarding optimum approach. The robotic approach may be advantageous due to the difficult location of the utricle. Utricles may be accessed via extraperitoneal, extravesical, transvesical, posterior sagittal, or perineal approaches.31,33,35,37,41 Concomitant cystoscopy can help define the limits of dissection in laparoscopic procedures.37,41 Reported conversions from laparoscopic to open approaches for utricle excision are uncommon.\n\nThe key principles of excision regardless of approach are adequate dissection, excision, and water-tight closure of the utricle orifice and avoidance of injury to the pelvic nerves, vas deferens, seminal vessels, seminal colliculi, and rectum.\n\nTable 5 Surgical approaches to prostatic utricle excision and post-operative recurrence of presenting symptoms\n\n\n  \n    \n      Approach\n      Endoscopic\n      Endoscopic\n      Open\n      Open\n      Laparoscopic\n      Laparoscopic\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Author\n      Cases\n      Recurrence\n      Cases\n      Recurrence\n      Cases\n      Recurrence\n    \n    \n      Liu\n      3\n      0\n      11\n      0\n      4\n      0\n    \n    \n      Desautel\n      2\n      1\n      13\n      0\n      –\n      –\n    \n    \n      Dai\n      13\n      5\n      –\n      –\n      4\n      0\n    \n    \n      Jia\n      –\n      –\n      8\n      2\n      6\n      0\n    \n    \n      Babu\n      7\n      2\n      2\n      2\n      1\n      1\n    \n    \n      Yeung\n      –\n      –\n      –\n      –\n      4\n      0\n    \n    \n      Bayne\n      –\n      –\n      –\n      –\n      4\n      0\n    \n    \n      Total\n      25\n      8 (32)\n      34\n      4 (12)\n      23\n      1 (4)\n    \n  \n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  The prostatic utricle is a small remnant of the paramesonephric ducts that persists in males as an expansion of the prostatic urethra.\n  Utricle enlargement is associated with hypospadias, cryptorchidism, disorders of sexual differentiation, and unilateral renal agenesis.\n  Prostatic utricles may be asymptomatic, cause symptoms related to obstruction or urinary stasis, or may present with abdominal pain, hematuria, or hematospermia.\n  Dilation of the prostatic utricle may impede catheterization of males with hypospadias.\n  Symptomatic prostatic utricles may be excised by open, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted approach.\n\n\nBladder Diverticula\n\nBladder diverticula are rare in the pediatric population, occurring in 1.7% of patients.42 Diverticula may be either congenital or acquired; congenital bladder diverticula are much more common in the pediatric population.43\n\nCongenital Diverticula\n\nCongenital diverticula are thought to be a result of a defect in the detrusor muscle. Ninety percent develop around Waldeyer’s sheath, which contains the ureter, and are known as Hutch diverticula.44 They may be classified as periureteral (diverticulum near but not involving ureteral orifice) or paraureteral (ureteral orifice involved in diverticulum).44 Distortion of the bladder wall and muscular tunnel of the ureter predispose children with these diverticula to vesicoureteral reflux. Congenital diverticula not associated with the ureter develop in the posterolateral bladder.43\n\nCongenital bladder diverticula are associated with genetic syndromes that impact connective tissue development: Ehlers-Danlos types IV, V, IX; Menkes syndrome; Williams-Beuren syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome.41,44,45 Unlike acquired diverticula, congenital diverticula are found in smooth walled bladders that typically demonstrate normal voiding mechanics, are solitary defects, and are not associated with increased risk of malignancy.43 Congenital diverticula occur more often in males and are generally larger than those acquired by neurogenic bladder dysfunction.43\n\n\nFigure 11 Intraoperative demonstration of large paraureteral bladder diverticulum with proximal dilation and medial displacement of ureter.46\n\nAcquired Diverticula\n\nAcquired or secondary diverticula develop because of neurogenic or obstructive pathology in the lower urinary tract. Though the most common type of diverticulum in adults, secondary diverticula are rare in pediatric patients and signal severe lower tract dysfunction.43 They are more likely to be found near the bladder dome, may be multiple, and are more likely to be seen in a trabeculated bladder. Acquired diverticula in general are associated with neurogenic bladder and bladder outlet obstruction, and in pediatric patients can be seen with posterior urethral valves &amp; prune belly syndrome.42,43\n\nClinical Presentation\n\nBladder diverticula in children most often present with UTI secondary to urinary stasis within the diverticulum or are discovered during work-up for hydronephrosis or febrile UTI and suspected vesicoureteral reflux.44,46 Upper urinary tract abnormalities can be found in 16-30% of cases.44 Less common presenting symptoms include irritative voiding symptoms, hematuria, abdominal distention and pain, enuresis, bladder stones, and outlet obstruction due to distortion of the bladder neck.46,47,48 Rarely, bladder diverticula can present with complete ureteral obstruction or intra- or extraperitoneal perforation.49,50,51,52,53,54\n\nMost patients with congenital bladder diverticula are asymptomatic, and—though far less commonly than acquired diverticula—may be incidentally diagnosed in adults.\n\nGiven the association with various genetic conditions, the frequency of upper tract abnormalities, and the possibility of underlying neurogenic or obstructive disease, it has been proposed by some that all children with bladder diverticula be tested for chromosomal abnormalities.42 Routine genetic testing is not currently recommended for patients with single congenital bladder diverticulum.44\n\nTable 6 Presenting symptoms and associated findings of children with bladder diverticula\n\n\n  \n    \n      Authors\n      # Pts\n      UTI\n      LUTS\n      Retention\n      Other\n      VUR\n      Hydro\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Alexander\n      47\n      26\n      2\n      0\n      2\n      32\n      19\n    \n    \n      Evangilidis\n      21\n      19\n      12\n      0\n      –\n      –\n      –\n    \n    \n      Marte\n      16\n      15\n      9\n      0\n      6\n      7\n      –\n    \n    \n      Bhat\n      12\n      5\n      –\n      12\n      4\n      9\n      5\n    \n    \n      Macedo\n      10\n      5\n      3\n      1\n      –\n      –\n      4\n    \n    \n      Total\n      106\n      70 (66)\n      26 (25)\n      13 (12)\n      12 (11)\n      48 (45)\n      28 (26)\n    \n  \n\n\nRadiologic Evaluation\n\nBladder diverticula are often first detected on bladder ultrasound as a hypoechoic cyst off the posterolateral bladder wall. The differential diagnosis for suspected diverticulum on imaging includes urachal cyst, everting ureterocele, ectopic ureter, bladder herniation into inguinal hernia, and bladder duplication.44 Voiding cystourethrogram with lateral and oblique views is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of bladder diverticulum and allows simultaneous evaluation for VUR.43 Particularly in cases without VUR, intravenous pyelogram or CT or MR urogram may be used to clarify the anatomic relationship between the diverticulum and the ureter.44 The upper tracts of children with bladder diverticula should be evaluated for hydroureteronephrosis.\n\n\nFigure 12 Congenital bladder diverticula seen on VCUG oblique views. Diverticula may range from small with very narrow necks to larger than bladder with broad-based openings.44,47,55\n\n\nFigure 13 Acquired diverticula seen on VCUG. Multiple diverticula present at various locations—including at the bladder dome—in trabeculated bladders. Photo on the right is from a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.42\n\n\nFigure 14 Congenital bladder diverticulum as seen on ultrasound, pelvic CT, and cystoscopy.56\n\nUrodynamic studies may be considered in patients with bladder diverticula if underlying lower tract dysfunction is suspected or if presence of a diverticulum does not adequately explain the patient’s presenting symptoms. Detrusor overactivity can be seen in around half of these patients, possibly secondary to hypotonia within and around the diverticulum and chronic urinary stasis.44,48 Diverticula complicate interpretation of cystometrogram, as they sink intravesical pressure. Stasis of urine within the diverticulum and associated VUR may also complicate results.44\n\nEndoscopic evaluation may help clarify anatomy and is recommended during surgical intervention but is not necessary for diagnosis of bladder diverticulum.\n\nIndications for Repair\n\nThough bladder diverticula do not resolve without intervention, not all patients require surgery. Adequate treatment of UTI and voiding dysfunction may resolve symptoms in patients with small, uncomplicated diverticula.44 For those with refractory symptoms or complicated diverticula, surgical excision is generally curative, and ureteral reimplantation can be performed simultaneously as necessary. Generally accepted indications for surgery include the following:43,44\n\n\n  Voiding symptoms refractory to medical management\n  Diverticulum &gt; 3cm\n  Frequent UTI\n  Complicated VUR\n  Urinary retention\n  Upper tract obstruction or deterioration\n  Bladder stones\n  Rupture of diverticulum\n\n\nUnlike in adults, malignant degeneration of the epithelium associated with pediatric bladder diverticula is generally not seen; however, any concern for malignancy would necessitate surgical intervention.43\n\nPrior to any operative intervention, voiding dysfunction should be evaluated and managed to isolate symptoms related to diverticulum and their evolution post-operatively. Associated pathology such as detrusor underactivity, bladder outlet obstruction, or spinal cord dysraphism should be addressed prior to diverticulectomy.\n\nSurgical intervention should be carefully considered in patients with underlying connective tissue disorders, as recurrence is likely in this population.44,53\n\nOperative Approaches\n\nBladder diverticulectomy may be performed endoscopically or via trans- or extravesical open or minimally invasive approaches. Transvesical and extravesical approaches mirror those used for ureteral reimplantation, and reimplantation may be performed as part of the procedure if necessary due to situation of the diverticulum or if indicated due to severe associated VUR. Cystoscopic evaluation of the diverticular opening relative to the ureteral orifice is recommended as part of operative planning. Multiple case series have reported complete resolution of symptoms—or marked reduction in voiding dysfunction symptoms—as well as VUR following diverticular excision regardless of approach.57,55 Occlusion of paraureteral diverticular opening via subureteral injection of bulking agents has been reported, though data on long-term efficacy are limited.58,59 One comparison of endoscopic, intra-, and extravesical approaches demonstrated successful resolution of VUR in 79, 91, and 80% of cases respectively.59\n\nImportant surgical considerations regardless of approach are culture-guided peri-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis, avoidance of injury or devascularizaion of the ureter or vas deferens, avoidance of rectal injury in repair of large posterior diverticula, and post-operative bladder decompression.44\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Bladder diverticula in children may be congenital—due to defect in the detrusor muscle, most often around Waldeyer’s sheath (Hutch diveritcula)—or acquired due to neurogenic or obstructive lower tract pathology.\n  Distortion of the bladder wall and muscular tunnel of the ureter by Hutch diverticula predispose children to vesicoureteral reflux.\n  Bladder diverticula in children most often present with UTI secondary to urinary stasis within the diverticulum or are discovered during work-up for hydronephrosis or febrile UTI and suspected vesicoureteral reflux. The majority of diverticula are asymptomatic.\n  Voiding cystourethrogram with lateral and oblique views is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of bladder diverticulum and allows simultaneous evaluation for VUR.\n  For those with refractory symptoms or complicated diverticula, surgical excision may be performed via transvesical or extravesical approach. Ureteral reimplantation can be performed simultaneously as necessary.\n  Prior to any operative intervention, voiding dysfunction should be evaluated and managed.\n\n\nSummary\n\nUrachal anomalies may present in various forms and most often cause drainage from the umbilicus or infection. Anomalies may be managed conservatively and can spontaneously resolve. Infected cysts may be percutaneously drained, and any symptomatic anomaly can be excised via open or laparoscopic approaches. The risk of malignant transformation of asymptomatic urachal anomalies in children is unknown.\n\nProstatic utricle dilation is associated with hypospadias and other genitourinary anomalies and may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms related to outlet obstruction and urinary stasis. Utricles may be diagnosed via RUG, VCUG, or US. For symptomatic patients, excision may be accomplished via endoscopic, open, or laparoscopic approaches, with endoscopic management conferring a higher risk of recurrence.\n\nPediatric bladder diverticula may be either congenital or acquired. Congenital diverticula are due to detrusor defects near the ureteral sheath and are associated with VUR as well as connective tissue disorders. Diverticula are often asymptomatic but may cause infection, irritative voiding symptoms, retention, or abdominal pain and are often associated with detrusor overactivity. Acquired diverticula are secondary to lower urinary tract obstruction or neurogenic bladder. Indications for operative repair include refractory or severe symptoms, size &gt;3cm, and associated urinary tract dysfunction. Intervention should be preceded by management of any other lower tract pathology. There is no consensus regarding operative approach, and ureteral reimplantation is often performed simultaneously.\n\nReferences\n\n\nJm P. Embryology of the genitourinary tract.

        "title": "Neurogenic Bladder",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nCongenital spinal dysraphism accounts for the vast majority of cases of pediatric neurogenic bladder and bowel.1 Other causes of neurogenic dysfunction involving the spine include sacral agenesis, tethered cord, cloacal malformations, and spinal cord injuries. Children with central nervous system abnormalities such as spastic diplegia (cerebral palsy) may also experience neurogenic bladder.\n\nPoor bladder dynamics can lead to chronic kidney disease and a multitude of potential sequelae.2 Management of neurogenic bladder includes achieving low pressure urinary storage and providing urinary continence while preserving upper tract function. Optimal treatment requires a multidisciplinary care team to prevent and manage potential sequelae that may affect function, quality of life, and survival. Given that spina bifida accounts for most cases of neurogenic bladder, it will be the focus of the chapter herein.\n\nEmbryology\n\nNeural tube defects (NTDs) are malformations of the brain and spinal cord resulting from failure of the neural tube to close during the third and fourth weeks of intrauterine development.3 Spina bifida occurs when the spinal cord is exposed and/or protrudes to the surface with the meninges through a vertebral wall defect. Spinal canal development begins on the 18th day of gestation and is completed by day 35, closing in a caudad direction from the cephalic end of the body. Spinal dysraphism is attributable to abnormal development of the cranial mesoderm.3 Failure of mesodermal ingrowth over the developing spinal cord results in an open lesion, most commonly seen in the lumbosacral area (Table 1). The exposed spinal cord and its nerve roots, which may protrude into the meningocele sac, and tension on the spinal cord as it moves cranially up the canal with elongation of the fetus (from L2, L3 in mid-late gestation, to L1 at birth), contribute to the variable picture of neural injury to the lower urinary tract and lower extremities.4 Hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari malformation type II (a combination of myelomeningocele and cerebellar tonsil herniation) are commonly associated with spina bifida.5\n\nTable 1 Spinal level of myelomeningocele.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Location\n      Incidence\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Cervical-High Thoracic\n      2%\n    \n    \n      Low Thoracic\n      5%\n    \n    \n      Lumbar\n      26%\n    \n    \n      Lumbosacral\n      47%\n    \n    \n      Sacral\n      20%\n    \n  \n\n\nEpidemiology\n\nSpina bifida is the most common neural tube defect, occurring in approximately 1 out of every 3,000 live births in the United States and 1 per 1,000 live births worldwide.6,7 Although the incidence of spina bifida significantly decreased after introduction of mandatory fortification of enriched grain products with folic acid in the United States, the population burden of spina bifida continues both in birth prevalence and in disparate long-term outcomes.8,9,10 Differences in maternal race/ethnicity have been shown to impact the prevalence of spina bifida with Hispanic mothers having a higher prevalence than Caucasian and Black women.11 Gender preponderance differs according to country; in the USA, spina bifida is thought to be more prevalent in girls than boys.12\n\nPathogenesis\n\nSpina bifida is typically visible at birth as exposed neural tissue with or without a protruding sac at the site of the lesion. Myelomeningocele is when the spinal cord protrudes from the spinal canal into a fluid-filled sac resulting from incomplete closure of the primary neural tube (Figure 1) The extent and severity of the neurological deficits depend on the location of the lesion along the neuraxis - depending on the level, interruption of the spinal cord at the site of the defect causes paralysis of the legs, incontinence of urine and feces, anesthesia of the skin, and abnormalities of the hips, knees, and feet.13,14 There is variable impact on somatic, parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation of the detrusor and sphincteric muscles, that affects the bladder’s ability to store and empty urine - myelomeningocele is almost always associated with neurogenic bladder. Poor bladder dynamics can then lead to chronic kidney disease and a multitude of potential sequelae.2\n\n\nFigure 1 Open myelomeningocele.\n\nMyelomeningocele is usually associated with a type II Chiari hindbrain malformation, ventriculomegaly, and hydrocephalus.15 Chiari type II malformation is the downward displacement of the cerebellar vermis into the cervical vertebral canal.5 It results in elongation of the brain stem and obliteration of the fourth ventricle, leading to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid circulation and development of hydrocephalus in 90% of patients.5,13 Treatment of hydrocephalus is required in approximately 82% of cases and involves draining of cerebrospinal fluid into either the peritoneal or other body cavity via a shunt.16\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nWhile optimal care of spina bifida related bladder dysfunction remains unknown, there has been a recent trend toward proactive rather than reactive management of children with neurogenic bladder.17 Observation involves periodic monitoring with noninvasive testing, including renal-bladder ultrasound, to evaluate for upper tract dilation/deterioration. However, many pediatric urologists now advocate for a full investigation of the lower urinary tract in infancy with initiation of prophylactic treatment either at birth or if there are signs of outlet obstruction and/or elevated bladder filling or voiding pressure on initial urodynamic testing.18,19,20\n\nIn 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a working group of pediatric urologists, nephrologists, clinical epidemiologists, methodologists, community advocates and CDC personnel to develop a standardized protocol to optimize urological care of children with spina bifida from the newborn period through age 5 (Figure 2)21 Renal-bladder ultrasound is obtained to determine baseline upper tract dilation.17 Videourodynamics are obtained by 3 months of age – fluoroscopic images demonstrate vesicoureteral reflux if present as well as irregular bladder contour/trabeculation (Figure 3)]. The prevailing issue at birth is whether detrusor sphincter dyssynergia is present and if the baby can empty at low pressures. Elevated detrusor filling pressure, bladder sphincter dyssynergia or elevated leak point pressures (&gt;40 cm H20) can result in upper tract damage and warrants early intervention with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and anticholinergics.22,23,24,25 With a proactive approach, infants are placed on scheduled clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) every 6 hours – the frequency of catheterizations may be decreased if volumes are consistently ≤30 mL; a key component is family learning to perform catheterizations prior to discharge.21,26\n\n\nFigure 2 Protocol for initial management of infant with spina bifida. Note that all newborns are started on CIC every 6 hours per protocol; catheterization interval may be increased and then discontinued if residuals consistently ≤30 mL and RBUS hydronephrosis ≤ grade 2. *Adapted from.21\n\n\nFigure 3 Elongated bladder with irregular contour and trabeculation consistent with neurogenic bladder (A). Smooth-walled bladder with left grade III vesicoureteral reflux in a newborn with spina bifida; also note bilateral clubfeet and severe hip flexion (B).\n\nTreatment Options and Their Outcomes\n\nThe goals of management of pediatric neurogenic bladder include achieving low pressure urinary storage and providing urinary continence while preserving upper tract function. The incidence of urinary tract deterioration is significant, reported at greater than 50%, when children with the potential for deterioration are followed with expectant rather than preemptive therapy.20,23,24 Severity of bladder dysfunction varies widely and changes over time, early urodynamic evaluation is key identifying children at increased risk – more aggressive urologic management is recommended for those individuals with hostile parameters.27,28,29\n\nEarly implementation of CIC and anticholinergic therapy has proven advantageous over time. Intermittent catheterization is typically initiated every 6 hours, with frequency increased to every 4 hours while awake and addition of oxybutynin 0.2 mg/kg/8 hours in those with unfavorable UDS findings. Anticholinergics are the mainstay to treat detrusor overactivity and reduce intravesical storage pressures in children with low detrusor compliance that places them at risk for renal compromise.30,31 In addition to oxybutynin, there are several newer selective anticholinergic medications (such as solifenacin and tolterodine) that are designed to diminish side effects by either targeting specific muscarinic receptor subtypes or by altering the structural compounds so that they are less likely to cross organ barriers.32 Mirabegron, a β3‐adrenoreceptor agonist, is an alternative treatment option to antimuscarinics, and has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in children and adolescents with neurogenic bladder dysfunction.33 With adequate drainage and management of detrusor overactivity, the bladder often remains compliant, expanding as the child grows, and maintaining appropriate wall thickness. Hydronephrosis and vesicoureteral reflux develop in fewer than 10% and social continence is readily achieved in the majority of patients with no additional inventions.20,34,35\n\nBotulinum-A Toxin (BTX-A) inhibits acetylcholine neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction and is considered an alternative to improving continence and urodynamic parameters of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in children.31 Studies have demonstrated significant improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters as evidenced by complete continence in approximately 65% to 87% of children and a reduction in maximum detrusor pressure and an increase in detrusor compliance in the majority of those treated.36\n\nBladder augmentation using small intestine or colon represents the definitive method of creating a low-pressure capacious organ for urine storage in a substantial number of children who have failed medical management, but its utility can be limited by both short- and long-term morbidity.37,38,39 Concomitant bladder neck procedures are performed as indicated. Surgical intervention should be individualized based on urodynamic findings, medical history, age, manual dexterity as well as social factors. The clinician must have a reasonable expectation that the family is prepared to undertake post-operative catheterization and irrigation regimens. At least one-third of children undergoing bladder augmentation will experience a complication, including bladder perforation, stone formation and need for additional procedures such as stomal revision.40,41,42 Metabolic abnormalities are a known consequence of incorporating bowel into the urinary tract, and patients must be monitored for metabolic imbalances including chronic acidosis.43 Malignancy, while rare, is a serious late complication of augmentation and underscores the importance of lifelong follow up for these patients.44,45,46 It is worth noting the need for augmentation cystoplasty to maintain adequate storage capacity is markedly reduced from almost 60% to 16% when compared to children followed expectantly.47\n\nSuggested Follow-Up\n\n\n  Renal-bladder ultrasound should be obtained at birth, every 3 months in the first year of life, and then annually along with serum creatinine, physical exam and blood pressure assessment.21\n  Baseline urodynamics at 3 months; annual study age 1, 2 and 3 years then every other year during childhood (UDS are obtained more frequently if hostile parameters, assessing response to therapy or new hydroureteronephrosis/incontinence/recurrent urinary tract infection).21,48\n  As the spina bifida population ages, patients, caregivers, and primary care physicians must be made aware of the baseline risk of cancer with neurogenic bladder and the need for close monitoring even in the absence of reconstructive and diverting procedures which increase the neoplastic risk in the urinary tract.46\n\n\nConclusions\n\nNeurogenic bladder encompasses a wide spectrum of disease depending on the degree of lower urinary tract involvement and the interplay between bladder storage capability and sphincter function. The mainstay of current neurogenic bladder management is non-surgical with anticholinergics and clean intermittent catheterization. Proactive treatment of children with spina bifida has been shown to be effective in reducing the need for surgical intervention and the development of ESRD by minimizing the effects of high-pressure reflux on the upper urinary tract. When indicated, surgical management is tailored to each individual patient, based on careful consideration of urodynamic findings, medical history, age, and presence of other disability.\n\nKey Points\n\n  Proactive management reduces long-term sequelae of neurogenic bladder\n  Elevated detrusor filling pressure, bladder sphincter dyssynergia or elevated leak point pressures (&gt;40 cm H20) can result in upper tract damage\n  Pharmacotherapy and CIC are the cornerstones of management\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n  Bauer SB.

        "title": "Voiding Dysfunction",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nLower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD) or dysfunctional elimination syndrome are all terms that describe what are the common array of symptoms which range from overactive bladder syndrome (OAB), voiding postponement, stress incontinence, giggle incontinence to dysfunctional voiding aside from others.1 The impact of daytime wetting in children can be quite profound—with social, emotional and behavioral effect on daily life.2 From our understanding of OAB we know that if it continues over a prolonged period of time, we will see thickening of the bladder wall, which can have an lifelong impact. As patients become older, the consequences become more profound and require more of an effort to correct.3,4\n\nFrom a pediatric urology perspective, the child with OAB is likely to becoming an adult OAB problems. This correlation has been seen in two published reports. In the first study Fitzgerald et al3 revealed that frequent daytime voiding in childhood correlated with adult urgency, and a correlation existed between childhood and adult nocturia. Childhood daytime incontinence and nocturnal enuresis were associated with a more than 2 fold increased association with adult urge incontinence. In addition, history of childhood urinary tract infection (UTI) correlated with adult UTI. In another study by Minassian et al involving 170 adult women they found that there was a higher prevalence of childhood voiding dysfunction in women who had urinary frequency, urgency, and stress or urge incontinence.4 They also noted that symptomatic patients had a greater likelihood of higher BMI. The trend has been to reassure parents that these problems are self-limiting and will resolve as the child matures. It appears that spontaneous resolution may not always occur and some children as they mature are better at compensating for their problems and eventually fail to follow up. A better understanding of the potential causes of childhood OAB can prevent undue problems in adulthood and make many children, parents and teachers much happier.\n\nGenetics\n\nIncreasing evidence exists that genetic factors have a major role in urinary incontinence. Children of parents that have OAB and/or underlying psychiatric problems tend to be more refractory to conventional treatments of OAB.3,5 These findings have been corroborated by Labrie et al, whose research shows that mothers of children with OAB or dysfunctional voiding are more likely to have similar symptoms in childhood than mothers of children without LUT symptoms (28.9% vs 16.3% p&lt;0.02, respectively).5 Fathers of children with LUT symptoms were more likely to have had delayed resolution of their nocturnal enuresis (6% and 6.5% boys and girls respectively) and also fathers who had daytime incontinence had a statistically significant rate of incontinence as children 9.25% vs 4.6% (p&lt;0.0001).5 Adult data can be used as a proxy for children. Looking at the data available, some studies that indicate a genetic predisposition to LUTS for some patients. A commonly used methodology to ascertain the importance of genetic influence is the use of twin studies. A Swedish study involving over 25000 twins revealed evidence of a genetic link for susceptibility to urinary incontinence, frequency and nocturia in women.6 There was insufficient data in male patients to make any conclusions. On the other hand, in a study looking at a metanalysis of candidate polymorphism/genes in men they found five genes ACE, ELAC2, GSTM1, TERT, and VDR. The heterogeneity was high in three of these meta-analyses. The rs731236 variant of the vitamin D receptor had a protective effect for LUTS (odds ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.83) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 27.2%).7\n\nWhen looking at the psychiatric literature there is a large number of studies linking psychological conditions and LUTS. The association of urinary incontinence and psychological well-being in adults has also been noted by Botlero et al.8 Major depression can predict the onset of urinary incontinence in women in an at-risk population based sample.9 One study found increased rates of enuresis in adult bipolar disorder (18%).10 An association with panic disorder and interstitial cystitis has also been described.11 Day wetting also was found to be a premorbid developmental marker for schizophrenia (SCZ).12 The authors found that patients with SCZ had higher rates of childhood enuresis (21%) compared with siblings (11%) or control patients (7%), and the relative risk for enuresis was increased in siblings. Patients with enuresis performed worse on two frontal lobe cognitive tests (letter fluency and category fluency) as compared with non-enuretic patients. Notably cerebral defects associated with these disorders tend to cluster around the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) exactly where defects are being seen in patients with urgency and urge incontinence on fMRI.13,14\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe prevalence of daytime incontinence varies widely from study to study. By 7 years of age, daytime incontinence rate ranges from 4.9 to 11.7%.15,16 At 11–12 years of age, prevalence rate ranges between 0.8% and 12.5%.17,18,19,20,21 A meta-analysis of these 3 studies was performed resulting in an overall prevalence of 6.4%. The most important study shedding light on a continual basis is the English ALSPAC longitudinal study which found the following trajectories for daytime incontinence over the age range 4.5-9.5 years:22\n\ni. Normative (86.2%); dry by 4.5 years\nii. Delayed (6.9%); steadily decreasing probability of daytime incontinence from 80% at 4.5 years of age to &lt; 10% at 9.5 years of age\niii. Persistent (3.7%); probability of daytime incontinence &gt; 80% until 7.5 years of age with steady reduction to 60% at 9.5 years of age\niv. Relapsing (3.2%); probability of daytime incontinence &lt;10% at 5.5 years of age increasing to 60% at 6.5 years with slow decline thereafter.\n\nThere was no gender difference in the delayed group but girls outnumbered boys in the persistent and relapsing groups. A study by Stone et al that evaluated children with persistent urinary incontinence who underwent urodynamic investigation and imaging of their spines revealed that, if extrapolated to 18 years of age, up to 33% of the children that were wetting at 10 years of age were likely to persist with some form of urinary symptoms.23\n\nNeuropsychiatric Comorbidity\n\nChildren with elimination disorders have an increased rate of coexistent behavioral and psychological disorders; approximately 20–40% of children with daytime urinary incontinence are affected by behavioral disorders.24,25,26 In a large epidemiological study of 8213 children aged 7.5–9 years, children with daytime wetting had significantly increased rates of psychological conditions, especially separation anxiety (11.4%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (24.8%), oppositional behavior (10.9%), and conduct problems (11.8%).27 In the same cohort, 10,000 children aged 4–9 years were evaluated; delayed development, difficult temperament, and maternal depression/anxiety were associated with daytime wetting and soiling.28 In another population-based study that included 2856 children, the incidence of incontinence was 16.9% within the previous 6 months.29 In a retrospective study of patients with ADHD, 20.9% wet at night and 6.5% wet during the day. The odds ratios were 2.7 and 4.5, respectively, which demonstrates a non-specific association of ADHD with nighttime and daytime wetting.30 Of the possible gastrointestinal elimination disorders, children with fecal incontinence (or encopresis) had the highest rates of comorbid behavioral disorders: 30–50% of all children had clinically relevant behavioral disturbances.24,25 In an epidemiological study of over 8242 children, those who were 7- to 8-years of age had a wide range of coexistent disorders (DSM-IV) including separation anxiety (4.3%), social phobias (1.7%), specific phobias (4.3%), generalized anxiety (3.4%), depressive disorders (2.6%), ADHD (9.2%), and oppositional defiant behavior (11.9%). A previous study found that patients described as having psychoneuroticism were less likely to respond to treatment of detrusor instability than those who had no form of psychoneuroticism. Most good responders and one third of non-responders were free of psychiatric issues.31 Of importance, 25% of the patients in this study had irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.\n\nEvaluation\n\nHistory\n\nEvaluation of the child with BBD begins with detailed history and physical examination. A clear history helps determine prevailing symptomatology and when the symptoms tend to occur. Generally, it is best to try to obtain the pertinent history from the child if they are cooperative. When obtaining the history from the child is not possible, there may be no choice but to obtain it from the parents. Signs of urgency such as crossing the legs, running to the bathroom, grabbing the penis, rubbing the clitoris, squatting and sitting on the heels (Vincent’s curtsy) are all signs of urgency. Maintenance of a voiding diary is critical. Urinary frequency is another manifestation of OAB and quantifying the amount and number of times the patient voids is useful in determining if there is true frequency. Urinary urge incontinence is a classic hallmark of overactive bladder. The time at which incontinence occurs should be documented to help identify any association with the bowel. It is not uncommon in children with large stool burdens to have urgency and urge incontinence after a meal. This is most likely due to stimulation of colonic contractions by the gastrocolic reflex. It is well understood that there is cross talk occurring in the spinal cord between the colon and the bladder.32,33,34,35 This may trigger bladder contractions or at least lead to symptoms of urgency. Post void dribbling is a sign of either incomplete relaxation of the whole sphincter complex or the external sphincter. It is common in children with dysfunctional voiding. Also commonly seen in dysfunctional voiding patients is dysuria or urethrorrhagia that is not associated with infection but rather due to dyssynergic voiding.33\n\nInternal sphincter dyssynergia has been associated with dizziness and autonomic dysfunction (hypotension on standing without concomitant increase in heart rate) for both males and females when patients are asked if they get dizzy on standing.36\n\nA thorough history of the patient’s bowel habits should be obtained from the patient directly. Many parents are not cognizant of the true nature of their children's bowel movements and many will report that their children's bowel movements are normal while the children will steadfastly contradict them. Documentation of the size and nature of the bowel movements should be obtained. Use of a diagram is quite beneficial and it facilitates communication with the child.37 It is important to note if the bowel movements are painful or associated with rectal bleeding. Large massive bowel movements are usually an indicator of infrequent bowel movements. Pain or rectal bleeding can be associated with external sphincter dyssynergia. Patients who have diarrhea or symptoms of colitis can also have issues with overactive bladder. Chronic periumbilical pain is another sign that there is a problem with constipation or issues with serotonin homeostasis in the gut. Many children will complain of this pain and once a bowel regimen is instituted the pain goes away.\n\nA standardized questionnaire should be used to evaluate patients when first seen and on follow up. There are 2 commonly used questionnaires that have been validated for children, the first is the DVSS and the other is the Vancouver Scale.38,39 Additionally, there is a questionnaire that evaluates the psychiatric makeup of the child and is quite useful to quickly screen for underlying attention, hyperactivity, depression and anxiety issues in children which are commonly associated with LUTS.40\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nPhysical examination is helpful in evaluation and can be very revealing. Examination of the abdomen is critical in determining whether there is palpable stool in the colon. Palpation of the left lower quadrant up to the left upper quadrant typically will yield large amounts of stool present in these abdomens. In many cases the parents may deny issues with their bowels. Gaseous distention of the colon is just as troublesome and should be noted since this can lead to the same problems as constipation.\n\nExamination of the back will typically reveal a normal appearing back and anocutaneous folds. The rare instance of flattening of the buttocks or abnormal creasing at the SI joint is indicative of a sacral anomaly (Figure 1) and (Figure 2) Observing the child walk can also help identify a potential neurologic problem if the child performs toe walking. High arched feet are another potential clue to some form of neurologic condition. Low lying sacral dimples are typically not of concern. Only dimples that are associated with tuffs of hair or a placed higher up on the back are of concern and should be evaluated with an MRI of the lumbar-sacral spine.\n\n\nFigure 1 Abnormal sacral cleft associated with tethered cord.\n\n\nFigure 2 Parasacral appendage associated with cord thethering.\n\nDiagnostic Testing\n\nBelow we discuss the diagnostic tests we perform in the order in which we perform them to optimize our management and minimize invasive testing in patients.\n\nUrinalysis\n\nThe first and most important clinical test that should be performed in all children that present with BBD is the urinalysis. A simple urinalysis should help determine if the symptoms are due to infection or BBD. It is not uncommon to see microhematuria in patients that have dyssynergic voiding which is commonly associated with BBD.\n\nPost Void Residual\n\nA PVR should be done on all patients seen for LUTS and DV. This is the most important piece of information that you have to go on in the early stages of the evaluation and can give you further immediate insight into the potential issues that need to be addressed. Elevated residuals can be associated with recurrent UTIs or frequent voiding, while low PVR can be also associated with frequency, but the underlying etiology of the frequency will be different.\n\nA device capable of providing a real image of the bladder is preferred over a device that gives a representative image. This is valuable since one can also measure rectal diameter. Rectal diameters in excess of 4 cm are associated with BBD and studies have shown correction of this dilation is associated with improvements in symptoms.\n\nUroflow/EMG\n\nUroflowmetry is an important tool in helping to determine if the child voids abnormally. The use of the 5 classic curves, bell, the tower or hypervoider, the staccato, interrupted and the plateau curve is in the process of being supplanted by a modified system that relies on whether the curve is smooth or fractionated and a flow index. The flow index is volume agnostic so therefore can be used to compare flows at all volumes and across multiple ages.41,42,43 Additionally flow indexes are a measure of voiding efficiency which is much more accurate representation of flow than shape descriptions.\n\nThe use of the uroflow is further augmented by the concomitant use of an EMG of the perineal muscles. Utilizing the perineal EMG allows us to determine if the child is voiding with external sphincter dyssynergia (increased perineal muscle activity) and to diagnose internal sphincter dyssynergia based on lag time and the shape of the flow curve (typically plateau or Flow index &lt;=0.7).44\n\nRenal and Bladder Ultrasonography\n\nRenal-bladder ultrasound is not essential for children with LUTS not associated with infection. On the other hand, a patient with repeat infections should have the upper tracts examined to look for size discrepancies and hydronephrosis which could be indicative of reflux or consequences thereof. In patients with persistent incontinence an ultrasound is useful to rule out a duplication of the kidney associated with an ectopic ureter. Dilation of a ureter may be another clue to suggest an ectopic ureter. In patients with obstructive voiding, the bladder ultrasound is helpful in identifying the presence of an obstructing ureterocele. Bladder wall thickening can be discerned from the ultrasound and is a useful indicator of obstruction or overactivity.\n\nKUB and AP Lateral of Spine\n\nIn some children where body habitus makes palpation of stool unreliable, it may be necessary to consider KUB to evaluate the colonic stool burden or to assess progress with a bowel regimen. If a KUB is performed, it is reasonable to consider an AP and lateral film of the sacrum to confirm that there are no sacral anomalies (Figure 3) In some children, a KUB can be inadequate to verify the spine is normal due to overlying stool obscuring the sacrum.\n\n\nFigure 3 Lateral fim of spine clearly shows sacral segments that would not be visible due to large stool burden in this patient.\n\nVoiding Cystourethrography\n\nA well-tempered VCUG provides a tremendous amount of information on the dynamics of voiding in addition to the presence or absence of reflux, ectopic ureters or valves. The bladder neck can be seen opening and the external sphincter can also be seen as it opens and closes. The presence of the spinning top urethra is a classic example of external sphincter dyssynergia (Figure 4) A VCUG is not indicated in all patients with LUTS. A VCUG should be obtained in refractory cases to further delineate the dynamics of voiding and confirm no anatomic problem is missed.\n\n\nFigure 4 Spinning top urethra in female with reflux and recurrent UTIs.\n\nMRI of Spine\n\nSacral imaging is indicated when the patient has an obvious lesion of the back, as previously mentioned in the physical examination section. In patients who have failed all treatment attempts and incontinence persists an MRI of the spine may also be indicated. We recommend the MRI be completed prior to urodynamics since detrusor overacitivity on urodynamics is not diagnostic of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Therefore, the patient will need an MRI of spine regardless and best to proceed with the definitive test first. Occult tethered cord occurs very infrequently when there is no cutaneous stigmata.45\n\nUrodynamics\n\nIn patients with LUTS, urodynamic study often only confirms a thorough history that uninhibited contractions (UIC) are present. Bael et al justify this statement as they demonstrated there was no benefit to performing a urodynamic study in children with BBD.46 The presence of UICs does not rule in or out the presence of a neurologic lesion. The only finding of significance is the absence of a detrusor contraction already evident from the uroflow study demonstrating a poor flow curve. This is not to say that there is no indication to perform UDS in children. In some instances, urodynamics are performed simultaneously with VCUG. In some cases, UDS can help identify the source of the wetting especially when combined with fluoroscopy.\n\nTreatment Options\n\nUrotherapy\n\nUrotherapy is an umbrella term for all non-surgical, non-pharmacological interventions for functional bladder and bowel problems in children and adolescents. It is the mainstay treatment for daytime urinary incontinence, as well as for nocturnal incontinence, functional constipation, and fecal incontinence.47,48\n\nThe goal of urotherapy is to normalize micturition and bowel pattern and to prevent further functional disturbances. A distinction is made between standard urotherapy and specific urotherapy. Three conditions must be met before urotherapy can start. First, a clear diagnosis of functional incontinence. Second, the child must be school-ready, when the child is too immature, he/she may not have the cognitive skills or motor abilities to understand and complete urotherapy. Third, a good psychosocial anamnesis as psychosocial or behavioral problems may also influence the effectiveness of therapy and may require psychiatric evaluation or family therapy.49,50\n\nStandard urotherapy consists of education and demystification, behavioral modification instructions, lifestyle advice regarding fluid intake, registration of voiding frequencies, voiding volumes and incontinence episodes, and support and encouragement to children and their parents.51 Urotherapy starts with an explanation of bladder and bowel function and dysfunction, explaining the causes of incontinence. Instructions should be given on correct fluid intake and regular voiding during the day. Instruction as to proper toilet posture should also be provided. A bladder diary should be kept for self-monitoring and motivation. The diary provides the child and parents insight into treatment progress. After explanation and instructions, the child practices at home for a maximum of three months. During this period, frequent counseling should be provided and progressed should be assessed frequently. These interval assessments can be done by telemedicine and/or regular visits to the clinic.\n\nConstipation or urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be addressed before urotherapy.47,48 As bowel and bladder dysfunction affect each other, urotherapy is less successful if bowel function and/or UTIs are not addressed during treatment.51,52\n\nSuccessful treatment is determined by the degree that the child and parents are satisfied with the results. Satisfaction and improved quality of life may be a reason to end treatment instead of endeavoring the best results. When treatment is not successful, it is important to identify the reason.\n\nWhen the results of standard urotherapy are unsatisfactory, specific urotherapy is recommended. This therapy combines specialist interventions such as biofeedback of the pelvic floor, cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, neuro-stimulation, or clean intermittent catheterization.47,48,51,53 Specific urotherapy is tailored to the specific type of bladder-bowel dysfunction and is composed of specific programs for children with treatment-resistant symptoms. These programs help children to learn how to void, when to void, and how often to void. Repeated practice is necessary to habituate the new voiding behavior.50\n\nChildren with behavioral problems require a tailored plan to the unique needs of the child.54 For comorbidities and severe bladder-overactivity, medication may be necessary.47\n\nUrotherapy is an effective treatment that achieves continence in 56% of children within a year, whilst the spontaneous cure rate of incontinence is 15% per year. Urotherapy addresses all aspects of incontinence, leading to the best clinical outcome. This includes somatic, psychosocial, and behavioral problems and quality of life.55\n\nBowel Management\n\nAcute, simple constipation or colonic distention in many cases may be addressed by simply increasing hydration and/or adding juices high in sorbitol, such as prune, pear and apple juice along with pureed fruits and vegetables to the child’s normal diet. Barley malt extract or corn syrup can also be used to soften stools. Other dietary changes include decreasing excessive milk intake as calcium saponifies the stool and leads to hardening. In addition, no evidence currently exists supporting the use of prebiotic and/or probiotic dietary supplements as a treatment of constipation.56 Following the failure of dietary interventions, other treatment options include osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol (0.7 g/kg body weight per day) lactulose, sorbitol or milk of magnesia (dose: 1–3 mL/kg body weight per day). No evidence exists that dietary fiber supplementation or biofeedback alone are effective interventions for constipation that requires medical treatment.56 Many patients require maintenance therapy in order to manage their ongoing constipation symptoms. In our own experience, osmotic agents are not as effective alone as when used in combination with senna laxatives or bisacodyl. The concern that senna alkaloids are habit forming or impair colonic motility is an ‘old wives tale’ and should be ignored: aggressive use of such medications is warranted in some children.57\n\nUse of osmotic agents by themselves has been borne out by Bush et al whose research showed that polyethylene glycol 350 was not superior to placebo during a 1-month trial.58 Management of constipation can result in up to a 50% resolution in voiding symptoms or greater.59\n\nPharmacological\n\nAnticholinergics\n\nAnticholinergics, (also known as antimuscarinics) are typically used as first-line treatments of OAB in children whose symptoms have persisted following urotherapy. Currently, only three antimuscarinics (oxybutynin [FDA and EMA] , Solfenacin [FDA and EMA] and tolterodine [EMA]) have formally received approval for use in children. The clinical trials that have been performed in children (oxybutynin, solifenacin, darifenacin studies) have generally included patients with proven neurogenic voiding problems and have not investigated the effects of antimuscarinics on patients with non-neurogenic, or idiopathic LUT symptoms. Data published in 2006 suggest that the therapeutic effects of antimuscarinics in patients considered to have no neurological deficits are mediated predominantly by interactions with the sensory/afferent limb of the reflex arc rather than with the efferent/motor side.60 Muscarinic receptors are found in urothelial cells, suburothelial cells of Cajal and on afferent nerves.61 Antimuscarinics are active during the filling/storage phase of micturition when the cholinergic (efferent or motor) nerves are not active. Acetylcholine can be generated and released from the urothelium as a response to bladder filling/increases in tension and also might ‘leak’ from the cholinergic nerve terminals during bladder filling62 followed by binding to M2 and M3 receptors and might be a mechanism of overactivity in patients with bladder diseases..63\n\nFive distinct subtypes of muscarinic, cholinergic receptors have been identified (M1–M5), and the bladder smooth muscle predominantly expresses two of these subtypes: M2 (70–80%) and M3 (20–30%). Activation of M3 receptors has been demonstrated to evoke smooth muscle contraction, which is the primary stimulus for bladder contraction. M2 and M3 receptors have been postulated to be involved not only in activation of smooth muscle contraction by efferent nerves, but also in the activation of sensory/afferent nerves.61 The activation of M2 receptors in the urothelium might reverse the sympathetically mediated smooth muscle relaxation that enables the filling, or storage phase of the micturition cycle; although, activation of the M2 receptors might cause smooth muscle contraction through other poorly understood mechanisms.64\n\nM1 receptors are found in the brain, glands (such as salivary glands), and sympathetic ganglia. Activation of these receptors’ accounts for most of the adverse effects of antimuscarinic drugs. Dry mouth is the most common symptom. Constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, blurred vision, urinary retention and cognitive side effects can also occur; these symptoms are generally less bothersome in children. The potential for adverse cognitive effects and delirium does also exist in children but is generally limited to overdosing situations.65,66,67 In clinical trials in adults, quantitative electroencephalographic data suggests that oxybutynin has more effects on the CNS than either trospium or tolterodine.68,69\n\nAlpha Blockers\n\nα-blockers (also known as α-adrenoceptor antagonists) on non-neuropathic voiding dysfunction was popularized by Austin et al to treat voiding dysfunction in children.70 These medications have been used in the management of patients with bladder-neck dysfunction and urinary retention, these agents are also useful in ameliorating the symptoms of urgency and urge incontinence in some children.71 Studies in adults indicate that alpha blockers are effective in managing irritative symptoms due to stents and in older men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.72,73 There is some evidence that alfuzosin reduced anal pressure at rest and during simulated evacuation in healthy and constipated women compared with placebo but did not improve bowel symptoms in constipated women.74 In many patients, terazosin, a non-selective α-blocker, is the first-line drug for treatment of urgency and increased urinary frequency, owing to the non-selective properties of this agent and the potential to cross the blood brain barrier; however, more-selective blockers of the α1-receptor such as tamsulosin or alfuzosin are better suited for the management of bladder neck dysfunction that can lead to detrusor hypertrophy and instability. Non-selective α-blockers can cause postural hypotension. Therefore, these agents must be used carefully, and a gradual titration of the dose is required. In patients with a family history of fainting easily or postural hypotension, dose titration is essential even with the use of more-selective α- blockers. For the most part, children tolerate α-blockers well.75\n\nBeta-3 Agonists\n\nAgonists of the β3 adrenoceptor, such as mirabegron can increase bladder capacity without increasing voiding pressure or post-void residual volume.76 Treatment with these agents leads to smooth muscle relaxation and the generally accepted mechanism of relaxation is via downstream activation of adenyl cyclase with the subsequent production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) followed by inhibition of the Rho-kinase pathway.77,78 However, evidence also indicates that elevated cAMP also activates protein kinase A, which then activates large-conductance calcium-dependent K+ (BK) channels. Activation of these BK channels leads to hyperpolarization of bladder smooth muscle and increased detrusor stability.79 Mirabegron is approved for treatment of OAB in adults and children in the US and Europe.\n\nOther Medications\n\nImipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that affects both muscarinic receptors and α-adrenoceptors with a possible central effect on voiding reflexes.80 When imipramine was introduced to treat depression it was found to have marked effects on patients’ urinary incontinence. We have found imipramine to be an effective agent in controlling urge incontinence in some children who were previously found to be refractory to antimuscarinic therapy.81 The effects of imipramine on urinary incontinence might be the result of an effect in the frontal areas of the brain which are involved in executive functioning including control of urinary urgency. Alternatively, the urological effects of imipramine might reflect an effect on dopamine levels in the striatum thereby affecting ɣ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the PAG. Increased GABA levels in the PAG impart suppression of the voiding reflex.82,83\n\nImipramine has also been found to be useful in treating our patients with giggle incontinence. Imipramine can cause postural hypotension and can also be dangerous in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities and must be used with caution.\n\nSSRIs and SNRIs\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to function at Onuf’s nucleus by modulating the voiding and storage reflexes which are dependent on glutamate. In the presence of glutamate, SSRIs augment the effects of incoming signals for bladder storage and also augment output to the external urethral sphincter thereby maintaining contraction of this sphincter. In the absence of glutamate, SSRIs have no effect upon signaling and normal parasympathetic activation resulting in contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter.84 This effect of SSRIs on the storage side of the reflex arc might explain how some patients’ bladder overactivity improves following treatment with SSRIs. These agents might also be acting in brain regions that are associated with processing of urgency signals, such as the ACG and PFC.\n\nElectrical Stimulation\n\nSacral Neurostimulation\n\nSacral neurostimulation (also known as sacral neuromodulation) involves the placement of a wire lead into the S3 foramina and along the sacral nerve with subcutaneous implantation of a stimulator to provide continuous low-intensity stimulation of the nerve. Spinal cord stimulation is frequently used in adult patients and interest in the use of this approach in children is increasing. In a series of 20 prospectively monitored patients with dysfunctional elimination syndrome, described by Roth et al cessation of symptoms or a &gt;50% improvement in symptoms occurred in 88% of children of whom 63% had nocturnal enuresis, 89% had increased daytime urinary frequency, and 59% had constipation. This group now has experience with sacral neurostimulation in 187 patients, with consistent outcomes.85,86\n\nParasacral Stimulation with Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation\n\nParasacral stimulation involves the use of a TENS device and parasacral conducting pads, which are placed parasacrally in the S2–3 region while the electrodes are connected on the surface to a current generator. Studies have used stimulation at various frequencies, ranging from 10–80 Hz and frequencies of treatment ranging from weekly to daily. Durations of stimulation have also varied from 20 minutes up to 1 hour daily. Walsh et al first described the use of TENS in adults in 1999 followed by Hoebeke et al in 2001 who described usage in children.87,88 In subsequent studies, complete resolution of symptoms has ranged from 47–61.9% of children treated with this modality.89,90,91 This modality has also been found useful in stimulating bowel motility using cross inferential current.92\n\nTibial Peripheral Nerve Stimulation\n\nPercutaneous electrical tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is based on the traditional Chinese practice of using acupuncture points over the common peroneal posterior tibial nerves to inhibit bladder activity.87,88 One technique involves using a 34-gauge stainless steel needle, which is inserted approximately 5 cm cephalad to the medial malleolus, just posterior to the margin of the tibia. A stick-on electrode is placed on the medial surface of the calcaneus. This approach has been evaluated in clinical trials with variable results. Hoebeke et al reported that 17 out of 28 children whose OAB symptoms were refractory to medical treatment had either resolution or improvement of their symptoms in response to weekly 30-minute PTNS sessions.91 DeGennaro et al reported after long-term follow-up monitoring that 12 of 14 children with OAB and 14 of 14 with dysfunctional voiding were asymptomatic after two years.88 The authors did note that ‘chronic’ persistent long term PTNS use was required in 50% and 29% of children with OAB and dysfunctional voiding respectively to maintain these results. In a study that compared the efficacy of TENS delivered to the parasacral region with that of PTNS in children with OAB, significantly better outcomes were observed with use of TENS compared with PTNS (complete resolution observed in 70% versus 9% of patients, respectively; P = 0.02).93 Figure 5 shows such a device.\n\n\nFigure 5 PTNS stimulation in a child.\n\nAnother form of tibial nerve stimulation is to apply patches over the nerve and stimulate the nerve like parasacral TENS. In a study comparing transcutaneous posterior tibial stimulation and sham stimulation in 40 children QoL scores, overall and day-time DVISS scores were significantly decreased in both sham and test groups (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the frequency of incontinence and urgency episodes were also significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) in the PTNS treatment group. This effect in the test group was still valid 2 years after intervention.94\n\nSurgical Options\n\nBotulinum Toxin A\n\nIntravesical injections of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) into the detrusor have been approved for use in adults with OAB. A recent study published by Austin et al in neurogenic patients has proven safety of BoNT-A in children and resulted in FDA approval in children with NDO.95 In adults, BoNT-A injections have proven a useful treatment of patients with refractory OAB and offer an alternative to patients that cannot tolerate anticholinergic therapy. Limited published studies are available on the use of BoNT-A in children primarily consisting of nonrandomized selected clinical cohorts of neurologically healthy children with treatment refractory OAB and urge incontinence.96,97,98 The dose of BoNT-A is variable in these studies and ranges from 50–200 units.96,97,98 The follow-up data from these three studies, total of 55 patients, reveal that a full response defined by complete continence was achieved in 38–70% of these children after a single, or repeat injections. Few clinically significant adverse events were reported; one patient had a UTI and one patient had temporary urinary retention.96,97\n\nBiofeedback\n\nBiofeedback is the process of gaining greater awareness of pelvic floor muscle/sphincter action using external instruments that provide information about the action of these muscles with the goal of increasing awareness and voluntary control by the child.\n\nWithin specific urotherapy, the focus is often on pelvic floor rehabilitation using biofeedback training. The theoretical benefit of biofeedback is that children are able to directly visualize the activity of their pelvic floor muscles by EMG or uroflow curve.99 This facilitates defecation and helps the child to get awareness of pelvic floor muscle (contraction vs relaxation). In dysfunctional voiding due to external sphincter dyssynergia the aim is to achieve relaxed unobstructed voiding and complete bladder emptying. Feedback can be given immediately about performance as with EMG or ultrasound or knowledge of results as with uroflowmetry and post void residual measurement.100\n\nThe feedback from EMG can be used to teach the child to contract and relax the pelvic floor muscles at will.99 Using real time flowmetry helps the child to observe the flow curve during voiding. Children can be taught to urinate with a relaxed pelvic floor muscle and normal urine volume by achieving a continuous, bell-shaped flow curve. Ultrasound can be used to check if the bladder is empty after urination and report this to the child.\n\nThe impact of biofeedback in dysfunctional voiders who have reflux is significant in that we saw 60% spontaneous resolution of reflux in children 6 years and older treated with biofeedback.101 Some have claimed that biofeedback is effective for urgency as well its mechanism may be via reduction of the outlet resistance during voiding which leads to detrusor hypertrophy thereby leading to detrusor instability. On the other hand there are studies in adults that indicate it may be effective in OAB patients due to the continual one to one therapy received by the patient and improvement in the mental well-being of the patient.102\n\nBiofeedback therapy is limited by the ability of the child to cooperate with the healthcare provider running the session. Children younger than five years of age typically are incapable of doing biofeedback on a regular basis. Children with significant learning disabilities, behavior problems and other neurologic problems are not ideal candidates for biofeedback. Additional studies reveal that biofeedback therapy is useful in the elimination of reflux in children that exhibit evidence of external sphincter dyssynergia.103,104\n\nIt is a misunderstanding that biofeedback alone is sufficient to achieve continence. In practice, professionals inadvertently combine biofeedback with education and instructions. By doing this, they also provide behavioral modification whilst thinking that they only provide biofeedback training. In urotherapy, biofeedback is merely one of the elements of treatment, type of biofeedback is not a decisive factor in treatment outcome.51\n\nDisorders\n\nOveractive Bladder\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nThe hallmark of OAB is urgency and by definition, children with this symptom can be said to have an OAB. Incontinence and increased voiding frequency are often present. Urge incontinence simply means incontinence in the presence of urgency and is applicable to many children with OAB. There is mounting evidence that OAB is a sensory problem; whether it is located in the central nervous system (CNS) or at the bladder level is a matter for debate. Children with incontinence not associated with a sudden urge to void or who are late to recognize the urge are more likely to have a neurologic problem or are more likely to have an issue with frontal lobe processing such as ADHD.\n\nTreatment Options and Pitfalls\n\n\n  Urotherapy, bowel program\n    \n      Avoid diarrhea or fecal accidents with poorly controlled or over aggressive use of osmotic agents and cathartics\n      Avoid excessive gas from overloading with fiber; gas is just as detrimental as constipation and results in distention of the gut\n      Fiber supplementation without water leads to worsening of the constipation\n    \n  \n  Anticholinergics or Terazosin or Doxazosin\n    \n      Dry mouth or memory problems can be due to anticholinergic medications. Watch for constipation becoming worse with anticholinergics\n      Dizziness and fatigue due to alpha blockers can be prevented by ensuring patients hydrate and increase salt intake.\n    \n  \n  Evaluate for neuropsychiatric problems and treating accordingly\n    \n      SSRIs can be associated with irritability and suicidal thoughts\n      Sympathomimetics for ADHD can lead to tightening of the bladder neck and potential negative effects on flow rates and even dysuria. Weight loss and constipation are associated with sympathomimetics.\n    \n  \n  Consider PTNS or TENS\n    \n      Some children have a fear of needles and PTNS is not feasible\n      Some children can overreact to the sensation and not tolerate therapy\n    \n  \n  If resistant, can consider imipramine if failed treatments\n    \n      Can be associated with irritability and suicidal thoughts\n      Can unmask bipolar disorder especially if a family history exists\n      Do not give the medication to patients with a familial history of conduction defects or sudden cardiac death\n      Medication must be under control of an adult at all times\n    \n  \n  If no evidence of elevated residuals can consider Botulinum Toxin A injections to detrusor\n    \n      Patients with flow indexes below 0.3 or elevated residuals &gt;150 cc should not receive Botulinum Toxin A injections due to the possibility of retention/CIC\n    \n  \n  If all else fails can consider sacral neuromodulation\n    \n      Complications with lead displacement\n    \n  \n\n\nDysfunctional Voiding\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nThe child with dysfunctional voiding habitually contracts the urethral sphincter during voiding. Uroflowmetry with EMG is necessary to confirm the presence of sphincter contraction during voiding. Note that the term describes malfunction during the voiding phase only. The term dysfunctional voiding is independent of the storage phase. It is entirely possible for a child to experience dysfunctional voiding and storage symptoms such as incontinence, urgency or frequency thereby presenting two issues that require correction.\n\nTreatment Options and Their Pitfalls\n\n\n  Urotherapy, bowel program\n    \n      Avoid diarrhea or fecal accidents with poorly controlled or over aggressive use of osmotic agents and cathartics\n      Avoid excessive gas from overloading with fiber; gas is just as detrimental as constipation and results in distention of the gut\n      Fiber supplementation without water leads to worsening of the constipation\n      Behavioral problems, like ADHD and ASS\n      Even if the child seems cooperative, an avoidant attitude towards correct voiding behavior can still prevail, failing to make the real effort needed to achieve the result.\n      Urinary tract infections\n    \n  \n  Repeat uroflowmetry and confirm if the problem persists\n  If etiology is external sphincter dyssynergia (ESS)\n    \n      Biofeedback\n      Timed voiding to prevent infrequent voiding\n      Manage detrusor overactivity if present. If overactivity is not adequately managed patients will continue to have urgency which will undo the biofeedback performed.\n    \n  \n  If etiology is internal sphincter dyssynergia (ISS)\n    \n      Alpha blockers\n        \n          Dizziness and fatigue due to alpha blockers can be prevented by ensuring patients hydrate well and increase salt intake.\n        \n      \n      If evidence of ESS, treat with biofeedback\n      Continue bowel regimen\n      Manage detrusor overactivity if present\n        \n          Anticholinergics or Terazosin or Doxazosin\n            \n              problems with dry mouth or memory problems can be due to anticholinergic medications. Watch for constipation becoming worse with anticholinergics.\n              Dizziness and fatigue due to alpha blockers can be prevented by ensuring patients hydrate well and increase salt intake.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nBulbar Urethritis/Urethrorrhagia\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nPain associated with voiding is commonly seen in patients with some form of dyssynergic voiding. In patients who have bulbar urethritis (dysuria/urethrorrhagia syndrome), the pain at the tip or along the shaft of the penis is most likely due to dyssynergic voiding. Correction of the voiding pattern eliminated the symptoms.33 In girls, vaginal or urethral pain can also indicate an abnormal pattern.\n\nUnderactive Bladder\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nThe old entity “lazy bladder” has replaced by the neutral term underactive bladder and is reserved for children with low voiding frequency and a need to increase intra-abdominal pressure to initiate, maintain or complete voiding (i.e., strainin). Children often produce an interrupted pattern on uroflowmetry. Formal diagnosis is confirmed with the use of urodynamics that demonstrate low voiding pressures. Unfortunately, there are no formal definitions for normal voiding pressures in children so we tend to use the pressures for adults.\n\nTreatment Options and Pitfalls\n\n\n  Evaluations will include a uroflowmetry with pelvic floor EMG and if possible a second abdominal muscle EMG.\n  If abdominal straining is evident with a weak inefficient flow rate (flow index &lt;0.7) and elevated postvoid residual, consider the diagnosis of UAB.\n  Confirm with urodynamics\n  Start urotherapy\n  Consider alpha blockers to help open bladder neck and improve emptying\n  Up to 50% of patients also have OAB and need treatment of OAB to prevent incontinence or recurrent UTIs\n  ISS is commonly seen in UAB patients and treatment with alpha blockers is necessary in these patients.\n  Consider CIC if patients have high PVR and or have recurrent UTIs; some have utilized sacral neuromodulation but with limited success\n\n\nPollakiuria\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nThis term applies to children who void often and with small volumes during the daytime only. Daytime voiding frequency is at least once hourly and average voided volumes are less than 50% of estimated bladder capacity (EBC), usually much smaller. Incontinence is not a usual or necessary ingredient in the condition and nocturnal bladder behavior is normal for the age of the child. The term is applicable from the age of daytime bladder control or 3 years.\n\nTreatment Options and Pitfalls\n\n\n  Evaluate the environment, commonly seen when a recent life event has occurred or there is an upcoming event such as the start of school, camp or holiday\n  Make sure there is no new constipation or change in diet\n  Initiate urotherapy, bowel program\n    \n      Avoid diarrhea or fecal accidents with poorly controlled or over aggressive use of osmotic agents and cathartics\n      Avoid excessive gas from overloading with fiber; gas is just as detrimental as constipation and results in distention of the gut\n      Fiber supplementation without water leads to worsening of the constipation\n    \n  \n  Consider Anticholinergics or Terazosin or Doxazosin\n    \n      Dry mouth or memory problems can be due to anticholinergic medications. Watch for constipation becoming worse with anticholinergics\n      Dizziness and fatigue due to alpha blockers can be prevented by ensuring patients hydrate well and increase salt intake.\n    \n  \n  Evaluate for neuropsychiatric problems if present consider treating accordingly\n    \n      SSRIs can be associated with irritability and suicidal thoughts\n      Sympathomimetics for ADHD can lead to tightening of bladder neck and potential negative effects on flow rates and even dysuria. Weight loss and constipation are associated with sympathomimetics.\n    \n  \n  Can resolve spontaneously\n\n\nGiggle Incontinence\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nGiggle incontinence is associated with complete voiding which occurs specifically during or immediately after laughing. Bladder function is normal when the child is not laughing. Giggle incontinence is clearly different than stress incontinence where voiding can be prevented or stopped volitionally.\n\nTreatment Options and Pitfalls\n\n\n  Confirm the diagnosis with a good history\n  Commonly seen in children with underlying neuropsychiatric disorders\n  Urotherapy and bowel regimen to make sure that this is not simple OAB\n  If no response, then initiate therapy\n    \n      Imipramine: Initiate dosing at 10 mg and increase to max of 75 mg\n      Atomoxetin: Initiate dosing at 10 mg and increase accordingly\n      Sympathomimetics: Dosing depends on medication chosen, should be long-acting version otherwise the patient is at risk of accidents when the medication wears off\n      SSRIs: Dosing is dependent on medication, chose the lowest dose and gradually escalate.\n    \n  \n  All the above carry the same problems\n    \n      can be associated with irritability and suicidal thoughts\n      can unmask bipolar disorder if a family history exists\n      do not give the medication to patients with a familial history of conduction defects or sudden cardiac death\n      Medication must be under control of an adult at all times\n    \n  \n\n\nVaginal Voiding\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nToilet trained prepubertal girls who wet their underwear within 10 minutes of voiding likely to be experiencing vaginal reflux if no underlying mechanism other than vaginal entrapment of urine is obvious. Vaginal voiding is not associated with other LUT symptoms. It is essential to differentiate vaginal voiding from post void dribbling since the treatment is quite different.\n\nTreatment Options and Pitfalls\n\n\n  Confirm the diagnosis and differentiate from post void dribbling, stress and urge incontinence\n  Commonly seen in young girls who do not pull clothes below the knee\n  Commonly seen in girls who have prominent labial fat\n  Commonly seen in girls who are obese\n  Recommend patients sit on toilet with legs spread and thighs apart or sit facing the wall behind the toilet which forces the legs to be spread\n  Frequently is associated with vaginal discharge and vaginitis\n  Can be associated with lichen sclerosis of the labia\n\n\nStress Incontinence\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nStress incontinence is the leakage of small amounts of urine at exertion or with increased intraabdominal pressure, typically associated with valsalva. It is rare in neurologically normal children. There is an increased association with hyperflexible girls involved in gymnastics and dance.105\n\nTreatment Options and Pitfalls\n\n\n  Confirm diagnosis and differentiate from post void dribbling, stress and urge incontinence\n  Surgical correction with open or laparoscopic burch106,107\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  \n\n\nConclusions\n\nasdf\n\nReferences\n\n\nRuarte AC, E Q.

        "title": "Bladder Exstrophy and Epispadias Complex",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nBladder exstrophy is a rare genitourinary malformation that, when simply defined, refers to the eversion of the bladder to the outside of the body (Figure 1). It is a rare genitourinary malformation for which the management still challenges the field of pediatric urology. More completely, the Exstrophy-Epispadias Complex comprises many defects that range from isolated male or female epispadias, classic bladder exstrophy, and even cloacal exstrophy.\n\n\nFigure 1 Newborn male with classic bladder exstrophy.\n\nIncidence\n\nThe incidence of bladder exstrophy was originally estimated between 1:10,000 and 1:50,000 live births. However, more recent data from the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects monitoring system and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the United States estimated the incidence to be 2.15–3.3 per 100,000 live births. There is a male predominance with the male to female ratio has been reported between 2.3–6:1.\n\nEmbryology\n\nMesodermal ingrowth between the ectodermal and endodermal layers of the bilaminar cloacal membrane results in formation of the lower abdominal musculature and pelvic bones. After mesenchymal ingrowth occurs, downward growth of the rectal septum divides the cloaca into a bladder anteriorly and a rectum posteriorly. The genital tubercles migrate medially and fuse in the midline cephalad to the dorsal membrane before it perforates. The cloacal membrane is subject to premature rupture depending on the extent of the infraumbilical defect. The stage of development when the membrane rupture occurs determines whether bladder exstrophy, cloacal exstrophy, or epispadias results.\n\nThe most related theory of embryonic development in exstrophy, held by Marshall and Muecke, describes the basic defect as an abnormal lower overdevelopment of the cloacal membrane, which prevents the medial migration of the mesenchymal tissue. Therefore, proper development of the abdominal wall does not occur. The timing of the rupture of this cloacal defect determines the severity of the disorder. Central perforations resulting in classic exstrophy have the highest incidence (60%) whereas exstrophy variants account for 30% and cloacal exstrophy 10%.\n\nOther theories are offered concerning the cause of the exstrophy-epispadias complex. Ambrose and O’Brian postulated that an abnormal development of the genital hillocks with fusion in the midline below rather than above the cloacal membrane result in the exstrophy defect.1 Another hypothesis describes an abnormal caudal insertion of the body stalk with failure of the interposition of the mesenchymal tissue in the midline. Because of this failure, translocation of the cloaca into the depths of the abdominal cavity does not occur. A cloacal membrane that remains in a superficial infraumbilical position represents an unstable embryonic state with a strong tendency to disintegrate. No one theory seems to elucidate all aspects of the complex seen clinically and further study is ongoing to fully describe the developmental process that ultimately forms the exstrophy-epispadias complex.\n\nInheritance\n\nEvidence exists for a genetic predisposition for exstrophy and epispadias. The risk of recurrence of bladder exstrophy in a given family is approximately 1 in 100 , much greater than in the general population. There are many reports of twins with exstrophy. At the same time, however, there are also reports of identical twins with both having exstrophy and another set in which only one was affected. There are numerous cases of nonidentical twins in which only one sibling was affected. These twin sets were found in both male and female pairs.2,3 Concordance analyses of twins with bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex also suggest a genetic etiology. A report of 151 families with exstrophy-epispadias complex found 4 multiplex families for a rate of 2.7%. The likelihood of an exstrophic parent producing a child with exstrophy is about 1:70 live births or 500 times the risk for the general population.3\n\nMany efforts have been made to understand the possible etiologies of the exstrophy-epispadias complex. The early developmental hormonal milieu associated with in vitro fertilization has been postulated to be involved based on studies that showed a 7.5-fold increase in exstrophy and cloacal exstrophy associated with the use of assisted reproductive technology such as introcystoplasmic sperm injection. Another epidemiology study showed an increased rate of exstrophy-epispadias complex births to women who underwent in vitro fertilization. A more recent study from a nationwide Swedish case-control study found that, in general, bladder exstrophy is seen as an isolated malformation without additional, major malformations. Bladder exstrophy patients tended to be associated with a low birth weight (&lt; 1,500 grams) and high maternal age (≥ 35 years).\n\nThe CASPR3 gene on chromosome 9 has been implicated by Boyadjiev and colleagues to be associated with the exstrophy complex. Another set of genes on the 9th chromosome has been identified to associate with bladder exstrophy. Genetic studies are attempting to determine where and if specific genetic factors can be found that are related to the exstrophy-epispadias complex. Multiple other possible gene loci have been identified but not confirmed.\n\nPrenatal Diagnosis\n\nDespite the magnitude of the defect in the lower abdominal wall and pelvic organ development, exstrophy of the bladder is still difficult to diagnose reliably by prenatal ultrasound. This is likely because of its rare incidence and that it is often mistaken for more common diagnoses of omphalocele or gastroschisis. Several groups have illustrated ultrasound findings important in the prenatal diagnosis of exstrophy. In a review of 25 prenatal ultrasounds with subsequent birth of a newborn with classic bladder exstrophy Gearhart et al described the main criteria for the prenatal diagnosis of exstrophy. These criteria included the absence of bladder filling, lower abdominal mass which becomes more protuberant as the pregnancy proceeds, a low-set umbilicus, separation of the pubic rami, and difficulties determining the sex of the baby.2,4,3,5 A more recent retrospective study out of Germany found the median gestational age was about 24 weeks. Again, all fetuses presented with the pathognomonic findings of nonvisualization of the fetal bladder and protruding abdominal mass below the umbilical cord insertion. In analyzing this data, bladder exstrophy should always be suspected on the basis of non-visualization of the bladder.\n\n\nFigure 2 30 weeks gestation ultrasound demonstrating nonvisualization of the bladder and a lower abdominal mass.\n\nIt is felt that 3-D ultrasound and the increasing use of fetal MRI will improve the ability to diagnosis bladder and cloacal exstrophy. Prenatal diagnosis allows for prenatal counseling and arrangements to be made for delivery at a specialized exstrophy center. This allows for a multidisciplinary approach by teams with experience dealing with the unique nature of the exstrophy-epispadias complex. This includes availability of reconstructive teams in the immediate newborn period and psychosocial support for the parents and families. With fetal MRI, one may be able to distinguish between classic bladder exstrophy and cloacal exstrophy with MRI. This could aid in prenatal counseling for the mother.\n\n\nFigure 3 Sagittal view of bladder exstrophy (mass) below abdominal insertion of the umbilical cord (AIC) on T2 prenatal MRI.\n\nThe diagnosis of bladder exstrophy is made (or confirmed) at birth with visualization of the bladder plate characteristically protruding beneath the umbilical cord with divergent rectus muscles on either side leading to widely separated pubic bones.\n\nAssociated Anomalies\n\nSkeletal Defects\n\nThe most obvious skeletal defect is the separation of the pubic bones, which is caused by the outward rotation of the innominate bones, eversion of the pubic rami, and a 30% shortage of bone in the pubic ramus.6 The mean external rotation of the posterior aspect of the pelvis was 12˚ on each side, retroversion of the acetabulum, and a mean 18˚ of external rotation of the anterior pelvis was determined by 3-D CT reconstructions. Further use of 3-D CT scans showed that the SI joint angle (before closure) was 10˚ larger in the exstrophy pelvis compared to age-matched controls and 10˚ more toward the coronal plane than sagittal. The bony pelvis was also 14.7˚ inferiorly rotated. The sacrum was 42.6% larger by volume measurements and had 23.5% more surface area. Combined, these deformities lead to a mean pubic diastasis of 4.2 cm at birth, increasing to 14.2 cm in adults. This compares to a symphysial width of 0.6 cm in control subjects. These deformities of the pelvic bones contribute to the shortened phallus, waddling gait, and outward rotation of the lower limbs in exstrophy patients. A study of 299 bladder exstrophy children indicated that spinal variations occur without clinical significance: spina bifida occulta, lumbarization or sacralization of vertebrae in 11%, uncomplicated scoliosis in 2.7%, and spinal dysraphism in 4%, including myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, scimitar sacrum, and hemivertebrae. Only one patient demonstrated evidence of neurologic dysfunction.7\n\n\nFigure 4 A, displacement of levator (Lev.) ani to more posterior (Post.) position in patient with exstrophy, that is 68% posterior to anus versus normal controls. Also note shortened anterior (Ant.) segment of levator ani in exstrophy 32% anterior to anus versus 48% in controls. Obt. int., obturator internus. B, greater outward rotation of 15.1˚ of obturator internus in exstrophy group versus controls. Also note that area encompassed by puborectalis is 2-fold that of controls and more flattened.\n\nPelvic Floor Defects\n\nData by Stec et al utilizing 3-D CT imaging demonstrated that the puborectal slings in classic bladder exstrophy patients support two times more body cavity than normal age-matched controls.4 While the levator muscle group in normal controls is evenly distributed posterior to anterior (52% to 48%) to the rectum, there is an uneven 68% to 32% posterior to anterior distribution in the exstrophy pelvis. There is also a significant flattening of the levators. A 31.7-degree decrease in the steepness is seen between the right and left halves of the levator ani and puborectalis sling. Consequently, the anus is anteriorly placed and sometimes patulous as a part of the posterior extent of the myofascial defect. These musculoskeletal malformations explain the increased rate of rectal prolapse, especially in the female exstrophy population.\n\nFurther study of the pelvic floor has been done with 3-D MRI and has impacted the understanding of the exstrophy pelvis for reconstruction. Williams et al demonstrated that the levator ani group was less dome shaped and more irregular in the exstrophy population prior to closure when compared to normal controls.8 There was also no relationship seen between the degree of pubic diastasis and the extent of disproportionate curvature of the levator ani muscle group . Review of post-closure pelvises by MRI revealed that in those with some degree of continence the intrasymphyseal distance was noted to be the shortest, the angle of the levator ani divergence sharpest, and the bladder neck most deeply positioned in the pelvis. Gargollo reported on MRI before and after exstrophy closure, noting that the puborectalis angle in those with dry intervals was decreased compared with that prior to closure.9 New reports of the use of 3D perineal ultrasound to evaluate the pelvic floor of adult exstrophy females showed that the ultrasound findings correlated well with MRI findings. These reports reinforce the necessity for aggressive dissection and posterior placement of the posterior urethra and bladder along with good reapproximation of the pubis at the time of closure. Osteotomies and pelvic fixation should be utilized if reconstruction is not done in the immediate newborn period.\n\nAbdominal Wall Defects\n\nThere is a triangular defect because of the premature rupture of the abnormal cloacal membrane in the abdominal wall, and it is occupied by the exstrophy bladder and posterior urethra. This defect in the fascia is limited inferiorly by the intrasymphyseal band that represents the divergent urogenital diaphragm and connects the bladder neck and posterior urethra to the pubic rami. Wakim and Barbet investigated the relationship of the rectus muscle and fascia to the urogenital diaphragm and found no gross or histologic evidence of the striated sphincter.10 They did find evidence of bladder musculature extending laterally to the pubis where it interdigitates with fibers from the rectus fascia to form the fibrous urogenital diaphragm. The importance of radical incision of these fibers lateral to the urethral plate down to the level of the inferior pubic ramus and levator hiatus for the bladder and posterior urethra’s position deep in the pelvis were demonstrated by Gearhart and colleagues, using data from failed exstrophy closures where these fibers were intact at the time of reclosure.11\n\nAt the cephalad, limit of the triangular fascial defect is the umbilicus. The distance between the umbilicus and anus is foreshortened in bladder exstrophy because the umbilicus is well below the horizontal line of the iliac crest. Although an umbilical hernia is usually present, it is typically insignificant in size and repaired at the time of initial exstrophy closure.\n\nInguinal hernias are common. They are due to a lack of obliquity of the inguinal canal combined with large internal and external rings and persistence of the processus vaginalis. Connolly and associates reported an 81.8% incidence of inguinal hernia in males and 10.5% in females.12 It is recommended to explore the inguinal canals at the time of exstrophy closure and excise the hernia sac with repair of the transversalis fascia and muscular defect to prevent recurrence or a direct hernia regardless of staged approach or complete primary repair. In addition, in the setting of concomitant exstrophy closure and inguinal hernia repair, the inguinal hernia recurrence rate is more than 30 % (much higher in males), reflecting an innate weakness in the abdominal wall and lack of obliquity of the inguinal canal. This is especially prominent within the first 6 months following initial bladder closure by CPRE.\n\nAnorectal Defects\n\nThe exstrophy patient’s perineum is short and broad and the anus directly behind the urogenital diaphragm. It is anteriorly displaced and corresponds to the posterior limit of the triangular fascia defect. The anal sphincter complex is also anteriorly displaced and should be preserved intact. These anatomic factors contribute to varying degrees of anal incontinence and rectal prolapse. Rectal prolapse frequently occurs in untreated exstrophy patients with a widely separated symphysis. Usually this is transient, easily reduced and disappears after bladder closure or cystectomy/urinary diversion. The appearance of prolapse of the rectum is also an indication to proceed with definitive management of the exstrophied bladder. If it occurs at any time after exstrophy closure, posterior urethra/bladder outlet obstruction should be suspected and immediate evaluation of the outlet tract by cystoscopy should be performed.\n\nThe implications of cloacal exstrophy (OEIS complex) upon the hindgut will be covered later in this chapter.\n\nMale Genital Defects\n\nThe male genital defects are severe and challenging at the time of reconstruction. The phallus is short due to 50% deficiency in anterior corporal length  with preservation in posterior length of the corporal body when compared to age-matched controls by MRI.3 The diameter of the posterior corporal segment was greater than in normal controls. The diastasis of the symphysis pubis increased the intrasymphyseal and intracorporeal distances, but the angle between the corpora cavernosa was unchanged because the corporal bodies were separated in a parallel fashion. This results in a penis that appears short because of the diastasis and the marked congenital deficiency of anterior corporal tissue. Releasing the dorsal chordee, lengthening the urethral groove, and mobilizing the crura in the midline to somewhat lengthen the penis can result in a functional and cosmetically appropriate phallus.\n\n\nFigure 5 Penile and pelvic measurements in normal men and patients with exstrophy. ZSD, intersymphyseal distance. UCC, corpora cavernosa subtended angle. Cdiam, corpus cavernosum diameter. PCL, posterior corporeal length. ZCD, intercorporeal dlstance. ACL, anterior corporeal length. EL, total corporeal length\n\nEpispadias is seen usually in conjunction with classic bladder exstrophy. However, rarely, it is seen as a solitary congenital defect in 1 in 117,000 males, and 1 in 150,000 to 300,000 females. It is characterized by the failure of the urethral plate to tubularize on the dorsum with the defect ranging from glanular to penopubic location. Most male patients also have some degree of penile dorsal chordee. Some female patients exhibit a bifid clitoris. In males, the likelihood of urinary incontinence can depend upon the severity of the epispadias defect. However, even those with glanular epispadias have been described has having incontinence due to “a field defect” impeding bladder and urethral contractility and coaptation. In contrast, almost all female epispadiac patients have urinary incontinence, given the high likelihood of a concomitant bladder neck defect.\n\nGearhart and associates used MRI to demonstrate in 13 adult men with bladder exstrophy that the volume, weight, and maximum cross-sectional area of the prostate appeared normal compared with published controls.13 However, they found that in none of the patients evaluated did the prostate extend circumferentially around the urethra, and the urethra was anterior to the prostate in all patients. The free and total PSA levels in adult bladder exstrophy men were found to be measurable but below the upper limits of established age-specific references ranges for normal men.13 There is a single report of a 56 year-old epispadias patient having prostate cancer with a PSA of 4.2 at the time of biopsy.14\n\nThe vas deferens and ejaculatory ducts are normal in the exstrophy patient as long as they are not injured iatrogenically during closure or reconstruction. The mean seminal vesicle length was found to be normal.\n\nThe autonomic nerves that innervate the corpus cavernosum (cavernous nerves) are displaced laterally in exstrophy patients, and these nerves are preserved in almost all exstrophy patients as potency is preserved after surgery. Retrograde ejaculation is found to occur after bladder closure and bladder neck reconstruction.\n\nTestes frequently appear to be retractile but have adequate length in the spermatic cord to reach the flat, wide scrotum without need for orchiopexy. The testes have not been studied in a large group of postpubertal exstrophy patients but are generally believed to be not impaired. D’Hauwers et al reported the use of percutaneous sperm aspiration and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and state in 3 exstrophy patients they had good success with sperm harvesting.(missing reference)\n\nFemale Genital Defects\n\nIn girls, the mons, clitoris, and labia are separated and the vaginal orifice is displaced anteriorly and stenotic. The clitoris is bifid and the vagina is shorter than normal controls but of normal caliber. The cervix is found on the anterior vaginal wall because the uterus enters the vagina superiorly. The fallopian tubes and ovaries are usually normal. The bifid clitoris should be reapproximated with the two ends of the labia minora to form a fourchette at the time of primary closure. Commonly, vaginal dilation or an episotomy may be required to allow satisfactory intercourse in the mature female. A study associated with the Association for the Bladder Exstrophy Community and social medial found 13- adult women with a history of bladder exstrophy.  Of these, 28.5% were treated for uterine prolapse.  36.2 % reported pregnancies, and of these 68% reported complications with pregnancy.15 Most adult women require interventions, medical and surgical for gynecologic concerns post menarche.16\n\nYet, despite bladder exstrophy being a severe condition, healthy pregnancies are reported with long term consequences to continence and sexual health.17\n\nUrinary Defects\n\nThe exposed bladder mucosa is susceptible to cystic or metaplastic changes and, therefore, must be irrigated frequently with saline and protected from surface trauma and exposure by a protective membrane until surgical bladder closure can be performed. Commonly plastic wrap (i.e., Saran Wrap) is sufficient. The mucosa at birth can have a segment of ectopic bowel mucosa, an isolated bowel loop, or most commonly hamartomatous polyps.\n\n\nFigure 6 Newborn with classic bladder exstrophy. Note multiple polyps on bladder plate.\n\nShapiro and colleagues characterized the neuromuscular function of the bladder. They showed that muscarinic cholinergic receptor density and binding affinity were similar in exstrophy and control subjects.18 Bladder biopsies from 12 newborns with bladder exstrophy, compared to age-matched controls, found an increase in the ratio of collagen to smooth muscle in the exstrophy bladders.19 The type of collagens was analyzed and a normal distribution of type I collagen was present, but a threefold increase in type III collagen was found. It was later seen that those patients who demonstrated bladder growth by measuring capacity after successful closure, who were free of infection had a markedly decreased ratio of collagen to smooth muscle. Primary cultures of exstrophy bladder smooth muscle cells were shown to have growth characteristics similar to those previously reported in non-exstrophy cells, showing that they likely retain their potential for growth and function. Mathews and associates found that the average number of myelinated small nerve fibers per field was significantly reduced in the exstrophy bladders compared with controls.20 Preservation of larger nerve fibers was seen, which led the study to hypothesize that bladder exstrophy in a newborn represented an earlier stage of bladder development. Multiple immunocytochemical and histochemical markers, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related product (CGRP), protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPHd) have been studied, and there was no evidence of bladder muscle dysinnervation morphologically in any cases of bladder exstrophy. However, cases of bladder exstrophy after failed reconstruction did have muscle innervation deficiencies that increased subepithelial and intraepithelial innervations. Microarray analysis of exstrophic bladder smooth muscle compared to ‘healthy’ controls showed what appears to be a developmentally immature finding in the exstrophy bladder smooth muscle.Therefore, it is felt that although the bladder in an exstrophy patient may be immature it has the potential for normal development after a successful initial closure.\n\nBladder plate polyps were found to be two types with overlapping findings: fibrotic and edematous. Both were associated with overlying squamous metaplasia in 50% of cases. Varying degrees of von Brunn’s nests, cystitis cystica and cystitis glandularis were noted. Cystitis glandularis was noted in a higher percentage of secondary closures. Future surveillance of those cystisis glandularis patients is recommended given their potential risk for adenocarcinoma. This can be done with urine cytology and cystoscopy as they enter adulthood.21\n\nThe bladder plate may invaginate or bulge through a small fascial defect at birth but the true estimate of the bladder plate cannot be evaluated completely until the newborn is under anesthesia and fully relaxed. A small, fibrosed, inelastic bladder and/or one that is covered with polyps may make a functional repair challenging and potentially impossible.\n\nNormal cystometrograms were obtained in 70–90% of those assessed in a group of continent exstrophy patients with normal reflexive bladders.22 An evaluation of 30 exstrophy patients at various phases of modern staged repair prior to bladder neck reconstruction found 80% to have compliant and stable bladders after bladder neck reconstruction. Approximately half maintained normal bladder compliance and fewer maintained normal stability. It was felt by the authors of that study that 25% of exstrophy patients might maintain normal detrusor function after reconstruction.23 The microstructure of the bladder of exstrophy patients at various points in modern staged repair was found to have different caveoli (important intracellular structures for cell-cell signaling). These caveoli were felt to be normal in those with a successful closure and improving bladder capacity but lacking in those who required an augmentation cystoplasty. They noted that the ultrastructure of cells also was abnormal in the group that failed initial closure.\n\nThe remainder of the urinary tract is usually normal, but anomalies do occur. Horseshoe kidney, pelvic kidney, hypoplastic kidney, solitary kidney, and dysplasia with megaureters can all be encountered. The course of the ureter is abnormal in terms of termination. Because the peritoneal pouch of Douglas, between the bladder and the rectum, is enlarged and unusually deep, the ureter is forced down laterally in its course across the true pelvis. The distal segment approaches the bladder inferiorly and laterally to the orifice. This results in vesicoureteral reflux in 100% of exstrophy cases. Ureteral reimplantations are done at the time of bladder neck repair but sometimes are needed sooner. If there are problems with infections and excessive outlet resistance, ureteral reimplantation may be needed prior to bladder neck reconstruction or at any point if severe reflux and upper tract issues develop.\n\nEvaluation and Management at Birth\n\nIn the delivery room the umbilical cord should be tied with 2-0 silk close to the abdominal wall, so the umbilical clamp does not irritate or traumatize the exposed bladder mucosa. The bladder mucosa should be frequently irrigated with warm saline and always covered with a protective clear plastic wrap until the time of closure. The bladder should be irrigated, and plastic wrap changed at each diaper change.\n\nA multidisciplinary approach is important. The team should include, but not be limited to, a pediatric urologist, pediatric orthopedic surgeon, pediatric anesthesiologist, neonatologist, pediatric psychiatrist (with expertise and experience in genital anomalies) and social workers. Studies have proven that the parents of exstrophy patients experience a significant amount of stress. The parents’ stress should not be overlooked during the initial and long-term care of the patient.24 The parents should be reassured that children with classic bladder exstrophy are generally healthy, robust infants with the prospect of leading a very normal life. Effective reconstruction to allow urinary storage, drainage, and control can be expected with acceptable cosmetic appearance. The support of psychologists, nurses, and parents of other children with exstrophy is invaluable.\n\nA neonatologist should evaluate the patient from a general pediatric and cardiopulmonary standpoint with the likelihood of major surgery in the first 48 hours of life. A cardiac echo is commonly done to rule out significant cardiopulmonary anomalies that would preclude early reconstruction. A renal ultrasound should be obtained to evaluate the upper urinary tracts. A KUB is done to evaluate the pelvis bony anatomy and a spinal ultrasound to rule out an associated spinal dysraphism.\n\nIt is essential that a pediatric genitourinary surgeon with experience and interest in the exstrophy-epispadias complex evaluate the newborn exstrophy patient, as the impact of a major birth defect is significantly worse by inappropriate initial management.25,26,27\n\nIn those patients with ambiguous genitalia in addition to bladder exstrophy the parents should be educated and counseled by a multidisciplinary disorders of sexual differentiation team but should understand that the need to change the gender rearing in classic bladder exstrophy is almost nonexistent in the male infant with current reconstructive outcomes.\n\nAs many of these cases still go undetected until the time of delivery, most will require transport to an exstrophy center soon after birth. During travel, the bladder should be protected by a clear plastic membrane and kept moist to protect the delicate bladder mucosa.\n\nSurgical Reconstruction\n\nThe goals of surgical reconstruction in the exstrophy patient are to correct the urogenital defects providing a reservoir that is adequate for urinary storage at low pressures with the ability to empty completely without compromising renal function, to create functional and cosmetically acceptable external genitalia, and to maximize patient quality of life.\n\n\nFigure 7 Intubation of bilateral ureteral orifices in preparation for dissection.\n\n\nFigure 8 Marking of urethral plate.

Therefore, for many years the management for exstrophy consisted of removal of the exstrophic bladder and urinary diversion commonly by ureterosigmoidostomy. Various staged repairs began to show early success in the 1950s.In the 1970s, the preliminary constructs of staged repair that are utilized today were initiated. This developed into the modern staged repair of exstrophy that is commonly used today.28 In the late 1980s an anatomical approach to exstrophy repair began and has been modified into what is now referred to as the complete primary repair of exstrophy or Mitchell technique.29 Currently, most patients are managed either with a complete primary repair of exstrophy (CPRE) or modern staged reconstruction of exstrophy (MSRE).28 A great deal of discussion continues regarding the optimal treatment of exstrophy in the newborn period. With that in mind, ureterosigmoidostomy remains a popular and preferred reconstruction in many parts of the world because it reliably achieves urinary continence and is relatively safe for those without access to dependable health care facilities or a specialized exstrophy center.\n\n\nFigure 10 Identification of bilateral corporal bodies after degloving of phallus.\n\n\nFigure 11 After separation of the corporal bodies and mobilization of the urethral plate.\n\n\nFigure 12 After complete separation of the corporal bodies and glans.\n\nComplete Primary Repair of Exstrophy\n\nThe CPRE is the most recent development in surgical management of exstrophy patients pioneered by Dr. Mitchell in 1989.30 This approach has been adopted and reproduced by multiple centers of excellence for exstrophy management. In the CPRE, an anatomic approach to reconstruction includes bladder closure with bladder neck remodeling and a disassembly technique for epispadias repair with or without osteotomies in one setting. It is felt this allows for bladder cycling and more ‘normal’ growth and development because the bladder experiences an outlet resistance. The disassembly technique for epispadias repair also allows for division of the intersymphyseal ligaments and appropriate anatomic placement of the bladder neck and posterior urethra deep into the pelvis in its orthotopic position.When done within the first 72 hours of life, the pelvis is malleable enough to close without osteotomies. The patients still necessitate Bryant’s traction for approximately 1 week and then lower extremity casting for 3 weeks to prevent tension on the pelvis closure. The incidence of dehiscence and bladder prolapse is rare in the modern era.\n\nThe CPRE is advocated as an approach to allow for maximal development of the bladder and define those patients whose bladders will grow and develop earlier than those managed in a staged manner. Normalizing the anatomy at the initial closure just after birth may have other benefits such as minimizing the family’s psychosocial trauma. Patients whose bladder does develop will likely undergo fewer procedures than in a staged fashion.\n\nContinence has been reported after CPRE to be 76%, defined as dry intervals longer than 2 hours and spontaneous voiding without catheterizations. However, a significant percentage of patients will likely still require a formal bladder neck procedure to achieve continence. In another series, 75% of patients after CPRE were continent with intervals of 4 hours and dry at night with 31.3% requiring CIC.\n\nConcerns with the CPRE are related to potential for renal deterioration related to a high pressure lower urinary system, risk of penile injury or loss with disassembly at such a young age, and requirement for multiple procedures despite the name ‘complete repair.’ Close follow-up of the upper tracts is important in exstrophy regardless of repair. Hydronephrosis, pyelonephritis and renal scarring are seen after CPRE and should be managed aggressively with prophylactic antibiotics since vesicoureteral reflux is expected post operatively. Long-term follow-up in the Seattle series shows that mild (45%), moderate (17.8%), and severe (7.1%) hydronephrosis is seen after CPRE. But half of those with hydronephrosis, and in all with severe hydronephrosis, it was transient. Borer and associates reported an incidence of pyelonephritis of 28% and DMSA renal scaring of 19% after CPRE.31 The need for bilateral ureteral reimplantation after CPRE exclusive of those done at the time of bladder neck repair are seen to be 25–34%.31,32,33\n\nApproximately 36–68% of patients will be left with a hypospadias after CPRE that will require further penile surgery.30,34,31,32,33 Glans necrosis, penile skin loss and/or penile tissue loss has been reported after CPRE but is quite rare when performed at an exstrophy centers of excellence.\n\nA recent systematic review examined the results of ten groups using the CPRE technique with 236 patients. Hypospadias repair was required for most boys having complete penile disassembly (22.7–68 %). Ureteral reimplantation was required as a separate procedure in 48–66%. Most children eventually also required bladder neck reconstruction for continence. Overall, voiding, without BNR was noted in 16–37 % of children in the reported series.\n\nComparing the number of procedures that a patient may be expected to undergo is a controversial topic when comparing the CPRE and MSRE. Reports vary widely about the number and types of procedures and the reports are fraught with potentials for bias making it difficult to draw true conclusions on this subject. However, it is accepted that patients managed in a CPRE or MSRE approach will likely require multiple procedures and the outcomes are better if managed at a center of excellence for exstrophy.\n\nIn 2013, the Multi-Institutional Bladder Exstrophy Consortium (MIBEC) was established to refine the CPRE, decrease complications, and improve outcomes. Since that time, MIBEC has managed to pool their outcomes (both before and after the consortium) in order to better study this relatively rare disorder, and critically evaluate their technique. Through the consortium, pediatric urologists work collaboratively as “surgical coaches” at the host institution to compound multiple experts’ expertise.\n\nOther groups have adopted this collaborative approach for the surgical treatment of bladder exstrophy. For example, the Pediatric Urology Midwest Alliance (PUMA) pooled their outcomes to assess outcomes of bladder augmentation/diversion and need for clean intermittent catheterization.\n\n\nFigure 13 Placement of suprapubic tube prior to bladder closure.

In the MSRE, the goal at initial reconstruction is to convert the exstrophic bladder to a complete epispadias. Pelvic osteotomies are performed in conjunction with bladder closure when indicated. It is felt that this will allow for protection from renal dysfunction because the patient is still incontinent but can also stimulate bladder growth since there is now some bladder outlet resistance. The epispadias repair is performed between 6-12 months of age and testosterone stimulation is provided preoperatively. The bladder neck repair for continence is performed between 4-5 years of age if they have an adequate bladder capacity and are determined to be ready to participate in a postoperative voiding program.35 If these criteria are not met, the patient is left incontinent until the bladder grows and maturity improves or they are diverted with an augmentation with a catheterizable channel and bladder neck closure when necessary.\n\nContinence rates after MSRE are reported by Gearhart in males to be 70% and females to be 74% with dry periods greater than 3 hours with spontaneous voiding and dry at night without CIC.35 They have concluded that a bladder capacity of 100 ml predicts success at the time of bladder neck reconstruction utilizing the modified Young-Dees-Leadbetter repair. This increased the chance of continence and time to achieve continence in their reviews.35,36 If this 100 ml capacity is not achieved it is felt they should undergo an augmentation at the time of reconstruction for continence. They also found that females were more likely to achieve continence and at a shorter duration after bladder neck reconstruction.36 Their reports also show similarly low complication rates. In males after bladder closure, epispadias repair, and bladder neck reconstruction the total complication rate was 41.7% with one incidence of primary closure failure.35 In females after bladder closure and bladder neck reconstruction the total complication rate was 19.5%.36 In their modern series if successful bladder growth occurs 19.4% of males and 17% of females failed bladder neck reconstruction and have undergone or will require an augmentation with a catheterizable stoma and bladder neck closure as indicated.35,36\n\nIn the MSRE, if a patient’s bladder capacity does not develop to the level that predicts success with bladder neck reconstruction, the patient is moved directly to an augmentation for continence. This is reasonable but clouds comparisons between MSRE and CPRE. The MSRE reports those that complete the series. Because the CPRE performs a continence procedure at the initial closure, they are including those patients whose bladders may not have developed and never been a candidate for a bladder neck reconstruction had they been managed by MSRE. Also, it is difficult to determine how many, if any, of those bladders that did not develop to 100 ml capacity by continence age would have grown had they had a CPRE at initial closure with increased outlet resistance available to promote development. There also may be a certain subset of exstrophy bladders that are ‘bad’ and will not grow regardless of closure technique but are unable to be identified at birth. These factors make it difficult to define success and failure when comparing techniques. Further long term prospective analysis needs to continue in an unbiased and open minded fashion to promote the interchange of ideas that can hopefully lead to the next breakthroughs in management of exstrophy that will continue to improve the quality of life of these patients.\n\n\nFigure 16 Phallus reconstruction.\n\n\nFigure 17 Fascial closure.\n\n\nFigure 18 Abdominal wall closure.\n\nSummary of Agreed upon Surgical Reconstruction Tenants\n\n\n  Management should be done at an exstrophy center of excellence and with a multidisciplinary team with the experience and interest necessary to care for these patients long-term.\n  Bladder plate should be moist and covered with saran wrap after birth until closure\n  Early successful primary closure is paramount to achieve continence later\n  Osteotomies are necessary if pelvis is closed at &gt; 72 hours of life\n  Close follow-up of upper tracts is important after bladder closure\n  Multiple procedures are required for to achieve continence and reconstruction of anatomy\n  Augmentation with or without catheterizable stoma and bladder neck closure may be required in those who fail to achieve continence or a &gt; 100 mL capacity bladder prior to bladder neck reconstruction.\n\n\n\nFigure 19 Modified Bryant’s traction.\n\n\nFigure 20 Postoperative.\n\nSexual Function in the Exstrophy Patient\n\nThere are reports of adult male exstrophy patients fathering or initiating a pregnancy. This shows that fertility is possible in these patients, although it may not be commonplace. Shapiro’s large series of 2,500 patients only documented 38 males who had fathered children.3 Semen analyses studies comparing men who underwent primary repair to ureterosigmoidostomy diversion found a normal sperm count in only one of eight in the closure group and in four of eight in the diverted group. These differences were attributed to retrograde ejaculation and iatrogenic injury during functional closure of the bladder. Another study found that none of their reconstructed patients could ejaculate normally, nor had they fathered children. Five patients who had not undergone reconstruction had normal ejaculation and two had fathered children.This leads to the conclusion that the male patient is at high risk of infertility after reconstruction. The use of assisted reproduction in any fashion has been shown by Bastuba and coworkers to be successful in 13 males with exstrophy that led to successful pregnancy with no incidence of exstrophy in the offspring.37\n\nWoodhouse reported that the sexual function and libido of the exstrophy patient is normal.38 Multiple reports show that erectile function is maintained in a vast majority after urethral and phallic reconstruction, and that ejaculation is often not normal but is usually present. Most reported satisfactory orgasms, and described intimate relationships as serious and long-term.39 However, a recent study using an anonymous social media survey to those men in the Association for the Bladder Exstrophy Communities report the Penile Perception Score, International Index of Erectile Function to be lower than published controls. Interestingly, a higher Penile Perception Score correlated with a higher IIEF-15 (sexual satisfaction) score. Recent studies by Rubenwolf et al demonstrate that the sexual satisfaction of both adult males and females status post a continent diversion appears to be comparable to that of those in whom that bladder is preserved with the majority in stable relationships.40\n\nThe female external genitalia are now routinely fully reconstructed at the time of exstrophy closure. Previously this reconstruction consisted of a cosmetic reapproximation of the bifid clitoris and anterior labia to make a fourchette but did not address the inherent anatomic abnormality of the vagina’s location and angle relative to the abdomen and perineum in exstrophy females. Further reconstruction during adolescent years, prior to initiation of sexual activity or use of tampons in some female exstrophy patients was not uncommon. An application of the total urogenital complex mobilization was applied and resulted in successful correction of the location and angle of the vagina in female exstrophy patients.18 Successful intercourse has been reported in all patients in one study and dyspareunia was reported in a minority.19 A large series also reported that female exstrophy patients greater than 18 years of age had normal sexual desires and many were sexually active with normal orgasms. Some patients were self-conscious of and limited their sexual activity because of the cosmetic appearance of their external genitalia. A monsplasty is an important part of reconstruction in females and use of hair bearing skin and fat to cover the midline defect is routine. A later repair with the use of rhomboid flaps was reported with good success.41\n\nObstetric and Gynecologic Implications\n\nMany women with bladder exstrophy have successfully delivered normal offspring (45 women with 49 children in one report).Another study showed 40 women, ages 19 to 36 that were treated for bladder exstrophy as infants, and out of those 40 women 14 pregnancies were reported in 11 women. Out of those 14 pregnancies were 9 normal deliveries, 3 spontaneous abortions, and 2 elective abortions. Uterine prolapse occurred in 7 of the 11 patients during pregnancy. It is seen to be very common for these women to have cervical and uterine prolapse after pregnancy and delivery.42 In these early reports, all women apparently had undergone prior permanent urinary diversions but recent reports show that successful pregnancies have been reported in women who have undergone continent urinary diversions.Cesarean sections were performed in women with functional bladder closures to eliminate stress on the pelvic floor and to avoid traumatic injury to the urinary sphincter mechanism.42\n\nAs mentioned earlier, pelvic organ prolapse appears to be a significant problem in female exstrophy patients. It is commonly seen during and after pregnancy or delivery, possibly in up to half of patients.19 It can occur at young ages and without prior sexual activity or pregnancy.19,43 The anterior displacement of the vaginal os and marked posterior displacement of the dorsorectalis sling and its deficient anterior compartment were theorized as reasons for significant findings of prolapse.44 It is felt that more modern reconstruction of the pelvic floor and anatomical replacement of the bladder into the pelvis and use of osteotomies may improve this troubling problem. Previous reports showed that uterine suspension was only modestly successful in prevention of recurrent prolapse.44 However, Stein reported that uterine fixation by sacrocolpopexy corrected prolapse in 13 females with greater than 25 years of follow-up.\n\nReferences\n\n\nHsieh K, O’Loughlin MT, Ferrer FA.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nCloacal exstrophy (CE) commonly referred to as the omphalocele, exstrophy of the bladder, imperforate anus, and spinal abnormalities (OEIS) complex, is the least common manifestation of the exstrophy-epispadias complex (EEC), however, it represents the greatest divergence from typical anatomy and development. As a multisystem defect, it requires a dedicated multidisciplinary approach to achieve optimal outcomes for patients and their families. This chapter provides a review of cloacal exstrophy through a modern lens alongside future directions in understanding this burdensome condition.\n\nEmbryology\n\nThe prevailing theory behind the EEC is the failure of mesodermal ingrowth to reinforce the cloacal membrane.1 The cloacal membrane is a bilaminar layer of ectodermal and endodermal tissue located at the caudal aspect of germinal disk of the developing infraumbilical abdominal wall. In normal development, during the 4th and 5th weeks of gestation, mesenchymal ingrowth between these layers forms the lower abdominal muscles and bony pelvis. Continued caudal descent of this urorectal septum results in fusion with the cloacal membrane and, ultimately, separation of the cloaca into the bladder anteriorly and rectum posteriorly (Figure 1).2 Perforation of the cloacal membrane typically occurs after fusion with the urorectal septum at approximately the 6th week of development, forming separate urogenital and anal orifices. The paired genital tubercles that give rise to the phallus, then migrate medially and fuse in the midline.3\n\n\nFigure 1 Development of cloacal membrane, urogenital sinus, and anal openings. Mesenchymal ingrowth with caudal descent of the urorectal septum and perforation of the cloacal membrane resulting in the urogenital and anal cavities.\n\nThe lack of mesenchymal reinforcement, and resultant overdevelopment of the cloacal membrane, risks premature rupture of the cloacal membrane. The timing, and degree at which premature rupture of this membrane occurs, results in the spectrum of conditions seen in EEC; CE is the earliest forming defect.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe incidence of CE is approximately 1 in 200,000-400,000 live births4,5 Historically in CE, there is a male-to-female predilection of 2:1, though some series place this closer to 1:1.6,7,8 With improved imaging modalities and prenatal diagnosis, however, the number of CE live births has markedly decreased as pregnancies are electively terminated in 23% of cases and up to 50% of pregnancies spontaneously abort.9\n\nMost cases appear sporadic, however, genetic analyses have identified possible causative factors. Thauvin-Robinet et al described an unbalanced translocation between the long arm of chromosome 9 and the Y chromosome resulting in a 9q34.1-qter deletion as a possible cause, while mutations in a group of homeobox genes including HLXB9 and the HOX family, impacting mesodermal development, were implicated by others.10\n\nIn addition to family history, other CE-specific risk factors have been implicated. In a clinical and molecular analysis of 232 families, advanced parental age emerged as a possible risk factor with an average maternal age of 34 years and average paternal age of 32 years (compared to 26 and 27 years based on 2010 census data, respectively). Interestingly, 49% of exstrophies were born from first pregnancies, which may also reinforce advancing parental age.10 Hormonal influences may also play a role as Wood and colleagues identified a 10-fold increase in exstrophy births to mothers who received large doses of progesterone early in the first trimester.11 In this same study, associations with assisted reproductive techniques were also reported as children conceived with in vitro fertilization (IVF) experienced a 7.5-fold increase in exstrophy.\n\nCurrently, the environmental factor most closely linked to cloacal exstrophy is maternal tobacco exposure, specifically periconception maternal exposure to smoking and maternal smoking during the first trimester.12 Taken together two critical points in counseling arise: 1) appropriate counseling regarding optimizing the periconception and first trimester periods – during the time of organogenesis and 2) an understanding of shifting societal views towards family planning (with first-time parents advancing in age) and the potential need for assisted-reproductive technologies.\n\nPathogenesis and Associated Anomalies\n\nThe complexity in determining the multifactorial causes underlyingCE is demonstrated in the range of defects observed in this phenotype (Table 1). As CE is the result of early developmental events, it presents with more anomalies to the severest degree and represents the most challenging end of the exstrophy-epispadias spectrum. The classic phenotypic expression of CE involves a strip of exstrophied cecum flanked by two exstrophied bladder halves which are often accompanied by a prolapsed ileal segment lending to the “elephant trunk” deformity (Figure 2). Additionally, the hindgut is shortened and often blind-ending, resulting in an imperforate anus. As the genital tubercles fail to fuse in the midline, two phallic halves are seen on either side of a widened pubic diastasis (Figure 3). The abdominal wall defect is generally accompanied by an omphalocele of varying size.2 Due to the multisystemic nature of this defect, each anomaly is described in more detail separately.\n\nTable 1 Cloacal Exstrophy and its associated anomalies.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Gastrointestinal\n      Genitourinary\n      Central Nervous System\n      Musculoskeletal\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Omphalocele\n      Unilateral renal agenesis\n      Tethered cord\n      Vertebral (absent or hemi defects)\n    \n    \n      Imperforate anus, anal atresia or stenosis\n      Pelvic kidney\n      Myelomeningocele\n      Club foot\n    \n    \n      Short gut syndrome\n      Ureteral duplication\n       \n      Hip subluxation\n    \n    \n      Intestinal malrotation\n      Hydronephrosis\n       \n      Paucity of pelvic floor musculature anteriorly\n    \n    \n      Intestinal duplication\n      Bilateral cryptorchidism\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n      Inguinal hernias\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n      Uterine duplication\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n      Vaginal duplication\n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 2 Male with classic presentation of cloacal exstrophy with prolapsed ileal segment creating the “elephant trunk” deformity.\n\n\nFigure 3 Photograph of male with cloacal exstrophy. Note, a colostomy has already been performed. Ce = cecum; hB = hemibladder; hP = hemiphallus; hS = hemiscrotum.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n\nBony Pelvis\n\nAnomalies of the bony pelvis and the associated pubic diastasis are the hallmark of exstrophy. In 1995, Sponseller et al utilized three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) of the bony pelvis in exstrophy patients and elucidated abnormalities that modernized our understanding of the characteristic widening of the pubic symphysis. Most notably, they identified two broad categories of abnormalities, deemed rotational and dimensional anomalies (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Anomalies of the Bony Pelvis.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Rotational\n      Dimensional\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      External rotation of the posterior pelvis/iliac wings\n      Increased pubic diastasis\n    \n    \n      External rotation of the anterior pelvic segment\n      Shortened anterior pubic segment (30%)\n    \n    \n      Coronal rotation of the sacroiliac joint\n      Increased intertriradiate cartilage distance\n    \n    \n      Acetabular retroversion\n       \n    \n    \n      Convergence of iliac wings\n       \n    \n    \n      Femoral retroversion\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nCompared to age-matched controls, Sponseller et al found that, in classic bladder exstrophy (CBE), the posterior pelvis is externally rotated an average of 12-degrees on each side, with the anterior pelvis externally rotated an average of 18-degrees. Additionally, the pubic rami are 30% shorter, which, combined with a retroverted acetabulum, leads to an average diastasis of 4.8 cm in CBE (Figure 4).13 In CE patients, these defects are even more exaggerated, with an overall 43% decrease in length of bone in the entire pelvis, with an average pubic diastasis greater than 6 cm and an increased likelihood of asymmetry between the right and left sides of the pelvis. For clarity, mild diastasis is less than 4 cm, moderate diastasis is between 4 and 6 cm and extreme diastasis is anything &gt; 6 cm.\n\n\nFigure 4 Pelvic bone anomalies noted in classic bladder exstrophy. The posterior bone segment is externally rotated 12˚ on each side, but the length is unchanged. The anterior segment is externally rotated 18˚ on each side and shorted by 30%. The distance between the triradiate cartilage is increased by 31%. Note, anomalies are more severe in cloacal exstrophy and asymmetry is more common.

Another consequence of the bony pelvis deformities manifested in the pelvic floor is the more flattened puborectalis compared to its usual conical shape. The paucity of anterior pelvic floor musculature and the lack of a conical shape drive the surgical technique in reconstructing the bony pelvis and pelvic floor, which is discussed separately.\n\n\nFigure 5 A) Pelvic floor musculature prior to exstrophy closure with osteotomy incisions marked. B) Lateral view of pelvic floor anatomy showing posterior displacement of pelvic floor muscles behind rectum.\n\nLower Limb and Gait Abnormalities\n\nAbnormalities of the lower extremities are consistently encountered in CE. As a result of the increased pubic diastasis, distance between the hips, and external rotation of the acetabula, children may compensate with outward rotation of the lower limbs and a waddling gait. Additional deformities include tibial torsion, equinovarus deformities, and calcaneus deformities.15 Despite these limb deformities, range of motion in these patients is usually not affected and as-needed corrective braces help correct the gait over time. By 2 years of age, most children are ambulatory with minimal use of assistive devices and few require wheelchair assistance in childhood.\n\nGastrointestinal Anomalies\n\nGastrointestinal anomalies occur to some degree in nearly all patients and add significantly to the morbidity and the degree of difficulty in managing these patients, both in the perioperative setting with respect to nutrition and in the long-term. Omphalocele is characteristic of this condition and found in 88–100% of cases.16,17,18,19 Omphaloceles may vary greatly in size and their contents, containing small bowel, liver, or both. Immediate closure of the omphalocele defect or housing it within a protective silo in the newborn period is typically performed to prevent subsequent rupture while providing a hospitable environment. In a series by Davidoff et al which included 26 patients with CE, all presented with an omphalocele. Of these patients, 19 (73%) were closed primarily with the remainder requiring staged reduction with a temporary prosthetic silo.16\n\nShort bowel syndrome, present in 25% of cases, is a pervasive cause of increased nutritional morbidity and may occur despite normal bowel length.4 A potential inherent absorptive abnormality of the intestine further underscores optimal perioperative nutrition in these patients and the need to preserve as much large bowel length as possible during reconstruction. If not utilized for stool, the hindgut remnant may be incorporated during reconstruction of the urogenital tract.17 While numerous pathways exist for initial management of the intestinal tract, work by Sawaya et al led to a paradigm shift in 2009 with initial tubularization of the cecal plate with end colostomy placement as this drastically reduced the occurrence of short gut syndrome and enabled future pull-through procedures in eligible candidates.20\n\nOther associated anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract are seen in 46% of cases and include duplication anomalies, gastroschisis, malrotation, duodenal atresia, and exstrophied colonic segments.16,17,21 Imperforate anus is also widely encountered, with one series noting its presence in 36 of 37 patients.17\n\nOther Urologic Anomalies\n\nAnomalies of the upper urinary tract are common, occurring in 41–66% of patients.17,18 Particular attention to identifying and understanding the patient’s upper tract anatomy is vital as unilateral renal agenesis, pelvic kidney or hydronephrosis can be seen in up to 48% of cases, with multiple concomitant renal anomalies in 16% of patients.^19,\\ 22^ Horseshoe kidneys, fusion anomalies, and ureteral abnormalities including megaureter and duplication are reported less frequently. Of note, ureteral anomalies can vary widely with possible ectopic ureteral insertion to the vas deferens in the male and into the uterus, vagina, or fallopian tubes in females.19\n\nCentral Nervous System and Vertebral Anomalies\n\nSpinal dysraphism, including tethered cord, myelomeningocele, or lipomyelomeningocele, is present in some form in 64-100% of patients, with 80% found in the lumbar region.2,18 Vertebral anomalies other than dysraphism include hemi-vertebrae and associated scoliosis, which is seen in 40% of patients, though the scoliosis does not progress in most cases.15 Due to this high incidence of spinal and vertebral defects, MRI evaluation of a newborn with CE is warranted with neurosurgical involvement as needed.\n\nNeurological impairment may ultimately affect bladder function, urinary continence, and lower extremity movement. The degree to which each may be affected is just as variable as the spinal and vertebral anomalies. Further, microdissection of an infant pelvis with CE in the post-mortem setting revealed abnormal origin and vascular supply of the autonomic nerves.22 This neurological unpredictability adds to the challenge in helping these patients achieve continence. Abdominal Wall Defects\n\nThe premature rupture of the cloacal membrane may result in a large defect with complete absence of the lower abdominal wall. While the presentation of this defect is readily apparent, subtleties require particular attention. As a result of the widened pubic diastasis and changes to the typical oblique orientation of the inguinal canal, inguinal hernias are noted in up to 50% of patients with CE and should be repaired.23\n\nAnomalies Affecting Reproductive Organs and Genitalia\n\nIn the male CE patient, complete asymmetric separation of the phallus into two halves with concordant separation of the scrotal halves is typical. The testes may be located within their respective hemiscrota; however, they are often undescended and associated with inguinal hernias, requiring surgical correction. In females, the clitoral bodies are similarly widely separated.\n\nMüllerian anomalies are also common in CE, with uterine duplication seen in 95% of cases.19 Partial duplication predominates with bicornate uterus being the most common subtype. Vaginal anomalies range from agenesis, seen in 25-50% of patients, to vaginal duplication, which occurs in up to 65% of cases.21 In instances of uterine or fallopian tube duplication, preservation should be prioritized for possible incorporation into lower urinary tract reconstruction.\n\nCardiovascular and Pulmonary Anomalies\n\nRarely, CE presents with immediately life-threatening cardiovascular or pulmonary defects. Reports, though rare, include a plethora of major anomalies including aortic duplication and caval duplication.23 Others have described Tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, pulmonary artery stenosis, and patent ductus arteriosus.24\n\nGiven the associated impact of this birth defect on the development of nearly every organ system, care for these vulnerable patients should be provided at a center experienced in the surgical techniques with cross-specialty perioperative and postoperative management.\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nMaking the Diagnosis\n\nConsidering the range of defects associated with CE, prenatal diagnosis has historically proved challenging, if not elusive. Accurately diagnosing CE and distinguishing it from CBE is paramount in properly counseling families, especially considering that children with CE tend to face more health-related issues in their lifetime. Prenatal diagnosis allows for planning that may optimize postnatal medical and surgical management. The first prenatal diagnosis of CE in 1985 relied on three key fetal ultrasound (fUS) findings: 1. A large midline infraumbilical anterior abdominal defect, 2. lumbosacral myelomingocele, and 3. failure to visualize the urinary bladder.25 Austin and colleagues further refined this list by delineating diagnostic criteria as either major or minor findings. Seen in &gt;50% of cases constituted a major criterion and included: non-visualization of the bladder (91%), a large midline infraumbilical anterior wall defect or cystic anterior wall structure (82%), omphalocele (77%), and myelomeningocele (68%). Minor criteria were those seen in &lt;50% of cases and included: lower extremity defects (23%), renal anomalies (23%), ascites (41%), widened pubic arches (18%), narrow thorax (9%), hydrocephalus (9%), and a single umbilical artery (9%).26 Despite vast imaging improvements in fUS since it was first introduced as a diagnostic tool, only an estimated 15% of patients have been diagnosed prenatally on fUS alone as findings may be incompletely identified as isolated omphalocele, CBE, or other midline defects.\n\nThe advent of fetal magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in prenatal diagnosis has added a valuable adjunct in evaluating CE. Compared to fUS, fMRI provides superior anatomical visualization when a bladder is not identified and may also aid in assessing the presence or absence of an omphalocele, associated spinal defects, and gender, when not readily identified on US.27,28\n\nRecently, Weiss et al identified key anatomic findings on fUS and fMRI to assess their respective validity in prenatally diagnosing CBE and CE. Between 2001 and 2018 they identified 21 patients who had prenatal imaging. CBE was the postnatal diagnosis in 14 and CE in the remainder. 15 of 21 patients had both fUS and fMRI available for review and the median gestational age for evaluation by prenatal imaging was 25 weeks. Of the 16 fUS with initial interpretations available, the original prenatal diagnosis was correct in 12 cases, yielding a 69% sensitivity of fUS. All 4 cases of incorrect prenatal diagnoses of CE were later determined to be CBE. Of the 18 fMRIs included in analysis, 16 of 18 diagnoses aligned (83% sensitivity) and the two incorrect prenatal CE diagnoses were reclassified as CBE. These misdiagnoses were attributed to a large protruding bladder plate with bowel loops posteriorly imitating an omphalocele containing bowel. They concluded that identification of the point of umbilical cord insertion on both fUS and fMRI was prudent to differentiate between CBE and CE given the abdominal wall defects.29\n\nVariants in cloacal exstrophy provide additional diagnostic challenges. Though exceedingly rare, a skin covered variant is also possible, as described in 5 of 6 patients in one small case series.30\n\nEvaluation and Immediate Postnatal Management\n\nAfter birth, it is essential to ensure that the patient is medically stable. A thorough physical examination is required to confirm the various anatomic anomalies that may be present (Table 1). Elucidating the associated birth defects and their severity aids in medical and surgical management. As with CBE patients, the exstrophied bowel and bladder segments are kept moist protected by plastic dressing.31 A complete imaging series, including plain films, US and MRI, helps determine the severity of associated defects and facilitates early involvement of consulting services such as pediatric orthopedic surgery, pediatric neurosurgery, and pediatric general surgery. Rounding out the multidisciplinary team with input and support from social work and nutrition services is key to caring for the infant with CE and their family.\n\nGender Assignment\n\nOnce the infant is medically stable and the complete extent of the condition is understood, an honest and thoughtful discussion regarding gender assignment is necessary. In many instances, this may require consultation from pediatric endocrinology, child psychology, or pediatric psychiatry. All gender assignment decisions should only be made after karyotyping, thorough discussion, and appropriate parental counseling.\n\nGiven the typical phenotypic expression with wide separation of the penile bodies and scrotum and diminutive corporal size in boys with CE, initial reports advocated universal gender reassignment of 46, XY boys to functional females.32 This drove early principles in management, including bilateral orchiectomy along with phallic reconstruction as a functional clitoris and vaginoplasty, either early or delayed.\n\nThe long-term effects of this practice are currently the topic of intense debate. Patients living longer with this condition offer a glimpse into the psychosocial implications of this practice and potential role of genotype and intrauterine hormonal milieu. In one cohort of 29 males with CE who underwent female gender reassignment, all 29 patients demonstrated a predominant male shift in psychosexual development despite not experiencing any pubertal hormonal surges.33 Other series, however, have demonstrated no differences in behavior or psychosocial issues, although there was one reported case of masculinization in a 46XY gender converted patient due to an ectopic testis.34,35 Current attitudes favor assigning gender that is concordant with karyotype, if possible. This was supported by a survey of pediatric urologists in which two-thirds favored gender-congruent reconstruction.36\n\nSurgical Management and Outcomes\n\nInitial Management\n\nPrompt omphalocele closure in the neonatal period is recommended to\n\nsafeguard against untimely rupture; however, this is only performed after neurosurgical concerns are addressed. At the time of initial omphalocele closure, 1 of 3 pathways is typically employed for intestinal diversion and hindgut management, including ileostomy creation with hindgut resection, ileostomy placement with hindgut mucous fistula, or cecal tubularization with end-colostomy creation.\n\nHistorically, initial intestinal diversion relied on ileostomy with hindgut resection, however this created several unintended consequences. Firstly, this induced short gut syndrome universally and made later reconstruction of the gastrointestinal tract less likely. Secondly, high-output ileostomies predisposed children to increased hospitalization with recurrent dehydration and electrolyte derangements.18,20 The induced acidosis secondary to high ileostomy output adversely impacts calcium homeostasis and directly modulates the growth hormone-IFG-1 axis, blunting the release of growth hormone. Long-term, this is associated with a growth-related morbidity in CE patients.37\n\nDue to this, there has been a paradigm shift in initial intestinal diversion and hindgut management. In their series of 77 patients, Sawaya et al found hindgut length varied widely from 2 to &gt;20 cm with over half in the 6 to 15 cm range. Interestingly, patients with genotype XY were more likely to have a hindgut length less than 10 cm compared to their XX counterparts. In this series, only 10 patients underwent hindgut resection and only for questionable hindgut viability or extremely short length. As a result, the authors advocated cecal tubularization with end colostomy creation to eliminate short gut syndrome and facilitate intestinal pull-through procedures.20 Typically, gastrointestinal reconstruction is performed 1 to 2 years after initial fecal diversion, however, if this reconstruction is combined with bladder closure, approximation of the pubis is paramount for successful bladder, abdominal wall, and bowel reconstruction. Typically, success of these reconstructions rely on pelvic reconstruction with osteotomies.17\n\nIn their same series, Sawaya et al performed eight intestinal pull-through procedures—7 by the age of 5 years, ranging from 2 to 12 years of age—and all patients had preserved hindguts of at least 10 cm in length.20 Other factors to consider when deciding whether to perform intestinal pull-through include ability of patient to make solid stool and evidence of anal sphincteric musculature responsive to stimulation when examined under anesthesia. In children who are not candidates for intestinal pull-through, a permanent fecal stoma is the most durable option for long-term management. Of note, if the hindgut remnant is not incorporated in the fecal stream, it should be preserved for later bladder augmentation or vaginal reconstruction.17\n\nIf it is determined at the initial stage of omphalocele closure that dual bladder and abdominal wall closure cannot be achieved safely and successfully, then the bladder halves should be approximated in the midline, converting the defect to a CBE.17 This allows abdominal distention and enlargement of the bladder plate for subsequent delayed closure. Finally, the hindgut is left as a mucous fistula at this time if not incorporated in the initial bowel reconstruction.\n\nUrinary Reconstruction\n\nModern Staged Repair\n\nUrinary reconstruction of CE parallels that of CBE. Approximation of the hemibladders posteriorly converts the defect from CE to CBE and involves dissection of the lateral aspects of the bladder halves from the abdominal wall, and closure in the midline.38 Restoring anatomy via placement of the bladder and posterior urethra deep into the pelvis remains a crucial factor in successful surgical reconstruction. Approximation of the widened pelvis aids in this goal, permitting abdominal wall and urinary tract reconstruction, however, this usually requires pelvic osteotomies and fixation, as will be described later in this chapter.\n\n\nFigure 6 Modern staged repair of exstrophy. Postoperative photograph of patient seen in preoperative photograph in Figure 3. Note osteotomy pin placement prior to application of external fixation device.\n\nThe large abdominal wall defect found in CE presents a significant challenge in tension-free abdominal wall reconstruction (Figure 7). Failure to consider tension at time of closure may impact rates of successful closure and fistula formation. Bioprosthetic materials such as Alloderm (Allergan, Branchburg, NJ) have shown great promise in bridging the gap in lack of abdominal wall tissue while providing a tension-free closure.39 Additionally, Alloderm has been used as an adjunct to decrease penopubic fistulization through coverage of the interpubic stitch at time of urinary tract reconstruction.40\n\n\nFigure 7 A, combined bilateral anterior innominate and vertical iliac osteotomy locations marked in bone with ideal placement of pin insertions. B, modified Buck’s traction (red arrow) and external fixation (blue arrow) at right.\n\nTo ensure congruence with the assigned gender, reconstruction of the external genitalia is performed as soon as possible in the immediate postnatal period. In genotypic males, this will ensure they are raised congruent to their phenotype. While the long-term psychosocial and psychosexual effects of children who undergo gender reassignment is currently the subject of great interest, as discussed earlier, histological studies of testes in male subjects who underwent gender reassignment confirm normal histology, even despite cryptorchidism.41 Given the often demure and asymmetric penile tissue present, phallic reconstruction remains challenging with mixed results.\n\nPhalloplasty has emerged as a successful reconstruction option for penile replacement, though this is typically delayed until late adolescence (Figure 8).42 However, in instances where the paucity of tissue requires male-to-female reassignment, initial genital reconstruction should adjoin the phallic halves in the midline to form a clitoris. When phallic tissue is adequate, however, epispadias repair is performed at 1 year of age, often using the well-described Cantwell-Ransley Repair.43 In genetic females, vaginal reconstruction is performed early, and in gender reassigned males, delayed reconstruction of a neovagina is appropriate with long-term dilation of the neovagina required.44 Due to the shorter urethra in genetic females, repair of isolated epispadias is typically combined with Young-Dees-Leadbetter bladder neck reconstruction (BNR), monsplasty, and clitoroplasty.\n\n\nFigure 8 Radial forearm free flap phalloplasty.

C, postoperative photograph demonstrating outcome of phalloplasty.\n\nThe Importance of Osteotomy\n\nOsteotomy has emerged as a critical factor in successful closure in most children with CBE is indicated in all children with CE at time of bladder closure.17,44 Osteotomy corrects the wide pubic diastasis and allows for orthotopic positioning of the bladder and posterior urethra as deep as possible within the pelvis while also facilitating bladder and abdominal wall reconstruction with minimal tension. This reduced tension correlates with decreased rates of dehiscence and postoperative ventral hernias. Additionally, osteotomy has been found to reduce the likelihood of significant complications from 89% in patients closed without osteotomy to 17% in children closed with osteotomy.45 This was confirmed in a large series of 80 CE patients that reported 91% successful exstrophy repairs with osteotomy performed at time of closure.46 While osteotomy has aided in successful closure, it has not been found to impact eventual continence in patients with CE.\n\nCombined bilateral anterior innominate and vertical iliac osteotomies are the preferred method at our institution and is coordinated with bladder closure in an approach coined the Dual-Staged Pathway (DSP).47 This approach to osteotomy in the supine position provides the added benefit of not needing to reposition the patient prior to bladder and abdominal wall closure (Figure 7). As a posterior approach is avoided, the risks of damaging any spinal repair are also minimized. Additionally, pelvic osteotomies allow gradual pelvic reduction with external fixation 2 to 3 weeks prior to bladder and abdominal wall closure. This is often utilized in instances of extremely wide pubic diastasis (&gt; 10 cm) and was successfully used in one patient with a pubic diastasis of 16 cm.47 At our institution, external fixation and modified Buck’s traction are maintained for 6 to 8 weeks to ensure adequate healing. In our experience, this immobilization technique provides exceptional results with a 3.8% failure rate in primary closures, compared to 65.7% for immobilization with a spica cast.48\n\nSingle-Stage Reconstruction\n\nAnother approach to repair in the patient with CE is the single-step repair, or complete primary repair of exstrophy (CPRE), popularized by Grady and Mitchell.49 Unlike the staged approach of abdominal and bladder reconstruction, followed by epispadias repair and a continence procedure, the single-staged repair combines aspects from each stage into a single repair. The procedure is similar to the one described for CBE, however it considers timing of closure with respect to the omphalocele, emphasizing delay in closure for a large omphalocele or other extenuating medical issues. Others have concluded that while single-staged repair is applicable to a select group of patients, other factors that may preclude its use are a small bladder plate, pubic diastasis &gt;6 cm, or other medical conditions such as spinal dysraphism, which, even in the absence of exstrophy, may require multiple surgical procedures .50 In a limited series of 6 patients, Lee et al reported successful closure with complete primary repair. They did note, however, the development of a midline bladder septum with associated hydronephrosis in two children. Additionally, one child voided naturally and another underwent augmentation cystoplasty (AC).51\n\nProponents of this technique advocate that it may decrease cost, the morbidity and trauma associated with multiple operations, and even stimulate early bladder growth. Epispadias repair in this instance is performed via penile disassembly wherein the urethral plate is dissected entirely from the corporal bodies. This allows urethral closure and positions the bladder neck posteriorly within the pelvis.52 CPRE advocates attribute the decreased number of operations to achieve continence to increased bladder outlet resistance at an early age. However, many patients still require BNR and, notably, only 20-56% of CPRE patients who remain incontinent achieve continence following additional BNR.53,54\n\nComplications\n\nBoth single and staged repairs are acceptable reconstruction techniques in CE. Though each approach has its merits, reported outcomes place the failure rate for a single-stage reconstruction at 48% compared to 15% for a staged repair. Wound dehiscence, bladder prolapse, bladder outlet obstruction, and formation of a vesicocutaneous fistula should all be considered failed closures and have been reported in both single and staged techniques.\n\nWith either surgical approach, successful primary bladder closure is the primary goal. A failed closure is devastating for the patient and family and the ramifications are significant. Patients that experience a failed primary closure in CE are subject to more operations and general anesthetic exposure. Though a failed bladder closure in CBE negatively impacts ultimate urinary continence, this impact on continence specifically is less pronounced in the patients with CE as most of these patients require additional continence procedures regardless of primary outcome.55,56 The ramifications extend beyond the additional operations to include financial morbidity. Goldstein et al performed a cost analysis in CE patients and found that with a successful primary repair of CE it costs approximately $196,000 to reach continence, while the cost to achieve continence rises to $407,000 after a failed primary bladder closure.57\n\nOne large series assessing predictors of successful primary closure in exstrophy reported that a staged CE closure, along with the use of pelvic osteotomy, were significant independent predictors of a successful closure. Additionally, after bladder closure, postoperative immobilization was crucial to success.58 For this reason, we recommend the use of external fixation combined with traction as is the norm at our institution. Other methods, such as spica casts may not provide adequate immobilization and may, therefore, lead to increased failure of pelvic reconstruction. Osteotomy complications are rare and often self-limiting, but include increased risk of transient nerve and muscle palsies (typically resolve within 12 weeks of surgery), delayed ileal union, and superficial pin-site infection or inflammation.59 In the experience at the authors’ institution, even though pelvic osteotomy with postoperative immobilization may extend hospital stay, the drastic reduction in failure rate is considered worthwhile by patients and care providers.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests the timing of the initial closure impacts success rates. In 2014, Shah and colleagues reported outcomes in 60 patients with CE and found that a 1 cm increase in pre-closure diastasis resulted in a 2.64 increase in the odds of failed initial closure. Subsequently performing osteotomy and delaying closure while allowing the external fixator to decrease the diastasis increased closure success. Interestingly, 77% of patients with a failed closure were closed within the first week of life compared to 26% of patients who underwent staged closure. Additionally, only 31% of patients in the failed closure group underwent osteotomy during initial closure group compared to 82% of the staged closure patients. Other protective strategies against failure include delaying initial bladder closure until after omphalocele closure.60 Finally, 92% of patients with a successful re-closure underwent osteotomy.47 These results demonstrating increased success in delayed primary repair were supported in another series that demonstrated a higher percentage of failures in primary bladder closure in patients closed within the first 30 days of life compared to those performed after 30 days of age (47.7% vs 19.3%).55\n\nTo achieve continence after a failed primary closure, a secondary bladder closure must be performed. Similar to findings reported by Shah et al., Davis and colleagues found that the age at which the secondary bladder closure is performed is predictive of overall success. They reported patients with a successful secondary bladder closure were more than a year older than patients who failed a secondary bladder closure (median age 104 weeks vs 38 weeks).56 Successful secondary closure had a median delay of 154 weeks compared to a median delay of 30 weeks in failed secondary closures. Failed urinary reconstruction in children with exstrophy is significant as it may lead to blunted bladder growth and loss of the bladder template, which may make it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to achieve continence.\n\nAchieving Continence\n\nDue to the frequent conglomeration of possible anomalies—small bladder templates, poorly compliant bladders, widely patent bladder neck (if at all present), and spinal anomalies that contribute to neurogenic bowel and bladder—voided continence is unlikely. However, continence remains the ultimate goal in exstrophy reconstruction to enable these children to live more typical lives. To this end, additional procedures are often required, as confirmed by Maruf et al in a large series that reported that patients require a median of 2 (range 1–4) urinary continence procedures to achieve a dry interval greater than 3 hours.61\n\nIn a large series from the authors’ institution assessing outcomes in 80 patients with OEIS complex, data on urinary reconstruction was available for 73 patients. Of the 40 dry patients, 38 retained their native bladder while 2 had small bowel neobladders (Koch pouch). Of the 38 patients with a native bladder, 30 (79%) received a continent catheterizable channel (continent urinary diversion, CUD) with either appendix (n =3) or bowel segment (n = 27), and 32 (84%) also had augmentation cystoplasty (AC) prior to achieving dryness. Only 9 patients (24%) maintained a patent and continent urethra.46 In an aggregate of studies assessing urinary continence in CE, AC was required in up to 50% of patients and an overall dry rate of 72%.62\n\nThese additional adjuncts for continence, AC and CUD, present unique complications including mucus overproduction, bladder calculi, chronic bacterial colonization, and epithelial polyps. Other long-term issues arise from AC including chronic metabolic acidosis and, less likely, carcinoma.63,64 With time, the stoma created for CUD may stenose, prolapse, necrose, or leak, requiring revision.64\n\nIn genetic females, successful continence may be achieved after Young-Dees-Leadbetter BNR, though most patients require clean intermittent catheterization. Techniques utilized in both males and females to enhance bladder capacity were previously described but include incorporating the hindgut segment (when available), the small and large bowels, and, less commonly, the stomach.38 Achieving continence is much more challenging in the reassigned male-to-female patient and a continent stoma may be the most advantageous strategy in the long-term.17 Regardless of the techniques employed, in our institution’s experience, children are continent of urine at a median age of 11 years.61 In one large series evaluating continence in cloacal exstrophy patients 50% (35 of 61) of children achieved continence, with 30 of 35 intermittently catheterizing via a continent stoma and the remainder voiding or catheterizing per urethra.65\n\nSuggested Follow-Up\n\nPatients with exstrophy, their families, and the treating medical and surgical teams develop a special bond that is unique in medicine. Following urinary tract and abdominal wall reconstruction and possible subsequent epispadias repair, the focus in management shifts to protecting the upper urinary tracts. To this end, at the author’s institution, we monitor for any evidence of reflux with yearly cystograms and cystoscopy while tracking bladder growth. In school-aged children (at least 5-7 years old) we assess bladder capacity, urodynamics, and the child’s ability to participate in their own care, through the evaluation of dexterity and maturity, prior to bladder neck reconstruction.31\n\nConclusions\n\nCE is a devastating multisystem birth defect that once predisposed children to significant morbidity and even mortality. Great strides, however, in the surgical and medical management of these children have enabled them to live near normal lives into adulthood. Success in contemporary management stems from the multidisciplinary approach to overcoming the challenges these patients face. As these patients continue to live healthy lives well into adulthood, we will continue to learn more with regards to quality of life and ways in which overall patient function may be optimized.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Accurate and thorough perinatal diagnosis is crucial in organizing appropriate multidisciplinary care—fUS and fMRI are useful modalities in this endeavor.\n  Initial postnatal management should ensure the patient is medically stable. Once stable, a thorough physical exam and proper imaging should be utilized to ensure complete recognition of all associated anomalies.\n  Abdominal and urinary tract reconstruction can occur only after neurosurgical evaluation for spine or CNS involvement and clearance.\n  Any hindgut remnant should be preserved at all costs in these children as it may be used in gastrointestinal or genitourinary reconstruction.\n  Separation of the bladder from the gastrointestinal tract with concurrent fecal diversion is key prior to future reconstruction. End-colostomy has emerged as the least morbid form of fecal diversion.\n  Close follow-up after reconstruction in these patients is essential to ensure preservation of upper tract function.\n\n\nFuture Directions\n\nCurrent research seeks to improve counseling and decrease morbidity associated with surgery by developing better predictive tools for patients and families. Better counseling may be achieved through tools, such as ones that predict bladder capacity and growth (Sholklapper et al 2022, submitted), which may have implications on future surgery and ability to achieve continence.66 Additionally, basic science research evaluating ultrastructure differences between exstrophy bladders and normal age-matched controls may provide a clearer picture of differential bladder growth curves for these patients. The use of imaging to assess pelvic floor anatomy as a tool for surgical planning provides additional information for intraoperative decision making and the use of this imaging is expected to expand. Long-term, addressing the growing field of translational urology and who cares for these children as they enter adulthood will help optimize care for these patients. Finally, the expansion of telemedicine for consultation among medical centers may improve communication regarding this rare condition and improve patient and family wellness through reduced burden related to accessibility, travel, and cost expenditures.\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Gearhart JP, Carlo HN.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe exstrophy-epispadias complex (EEC) comprises a wide spectrum of congenital anomalies, all arising from the same embryological defect, ranging from simple glandular epispadias to cloacal exstrophy.1\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe Bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex (BEEC) is more frequent in caucasians. Classic bladder exstrophy (BEX) is the predominant subtype (50%), occurring in 2.15 - 3.3/100,000 live births, and cloacal exstrophy (CEX) is seen in 1/200,000. In recent decades there has been an increase in diagnostic suspicion with advances in fetal medicine.2,3\n\nThere is a male predominance and the male to female ratio has been reported between 2.3-6:1.4 However, cloacal exstrophy is the same in both genders (1:1).\n\nMortality in patients with bladder exstrophy is low (4%). Thanks to advances in surgical techniques and current management, the long-term survival of these patients is excellent, reporting improvements in fertility and sexual function for both women and men with BEX. Furthermore, the survival of children with CEX has improved from 50% in 1960 to more than 80% today.\n\nEtiopathogenesis\n\nEmbryology\n\nThe separation of the primitive cloaca into the urogenital sinus and hindgut occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy, about the same time that the anterior abdominal wall is formed. The cloacal membrane is a bilaminar layer located at the caudal end of the germinal disc that occupies the infraumbilical abdominal wall. Mesodermal ingrowth between the ectodermal and endodermal layers of the bilaminar cloacal membrane results in formation of the lower abdominal musculature and pelvic bones. After mesenchymal ingrowth occurs, the urorectal septum advances caudally and divides the cloaca into the bladder anteriorly and the rectum posteriorly. Distally, the septum meets the posterior remnant of the bilaminar membrane, which eventually perforates and forms the urogenital and anal openings. The paired genital tubercles migrate medially and fuse in the midline, cephalad to the dorsal membrane before perforation. A failure in the migration of mesenchymal cells between the ectodermal and endodermal layers of the lower abdominal wall causes instability of the cloacal membrane.5 The premature rupture of this membrane, prior to its caudal migration, leads to the development of this group of infraumbilical anomalies. The extent of the infraumbilical defect and the stage of development when the rupture occurs determines whether bladder exstrophy, cloacal exstrophy, or epispadias results. If the rupture occurs after complete separation of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, classic BEX occurs. However, if this occurs before the descent of the urorectal septum, there is externalization of the lower urinary tract and the distal portion of the gastrointestinal tract, giving rise to cloacal exstrophy (Figure 1).\n\n\nFigure 1 Division of the cloaca into an anterior primitive urogenital sinus and a posterior rectum between the 4th and 6th weeks of gestation\n\nThe most related theory of embryonic development in exstrophy, held by Marshall and Muecke,6 describes the basic defect as an abnormal lower overdevelopment of the cloacal membrane, which prevents the medial migration of the mesenchymal tissue. Therefore, proper development of the abdominal wall does not occur. The timing of the rupture of this cloacal defect determines the severity of the disorder. Central perforations resulting in classic exstrophy have the highest incidence (60%) whereas exstrophy variants account for 30% and cloacal exstrophy 10%.\n\nOther theories are offered concerning the cause of the exstrophy-epispadias complex.7,8 Ambrose and O’Brian9 postulated that an abnormal development of the genital hillocks with fusion in the midline below rather than above the cloacal membrane result in the exstrophy defect. Another hypothesis describes an abnormal caudal insertion of the body stalk with failure of the interposition of the mesenchymal tissue in the midline.10 Because of this failure, translocation of the cloaca into the depths of the abdominal cavity does not occur. A cloacal membrane that remains in a superficial infraumbilical position represents an unstable embryonic state with a strong tendency to disintegrate.11 No one theory seems to elucidate all aspects of the complex seen clinically and further study is ongoing to fully describe the developmental process that ultimately forms the exstrophy-epispadias complex.\n\nEtiology\n\nThe exact etiology of this disease has not yet been identified. Nevertheless, it has been confirmed that the triggering event occurs early in pregnancy.8 Multiple ongoing studies suggest a possible genetic basis for the development of these conditions.11 There is a higher incidence in children of mothers who received large doses of progesterone in early stages of pregnancy, as in cases of assisted reproduction therapies, and it is estimated that the incidence is up to 7.5 times higher in cases where in vitro fertilization was used.11\n\nRecurrence Risk\n\nThe possible role of genetic factors implicated in the expression of EEC is based on the increased recurrence risk for offspring of affected individuals.8 Among siblings, Ives et al estimated the recurrence risk to be approximately 1% in non-consanguineous and non-affected parents of BEX cases.12 Shapiro et al.13 estimated the risk of recurrence for siblings of European background for isolated BEX as 1 in 275, having surveyed 2,500 CEB families. They also described a 400-fold increased risk of classic BEX in offspring of affected individuals compared to the general population. Based on a prevalence of 3.3:100,000 (~1:30.000) for isolated BEX among populations of European background, the recurrence risk ratio in siblings has been calculated to be 108 (1:275/1:30.000 ~108).14 While female EEC patients represent the minority of patients, interestingly, only affected females produced affected offspring.13 Among other explanations, this superficial higher recurrence risk for affected females may be due to a higher genetic liability for EEC (so-called Carter effect).15\n\nFamilial Recurrences\n\nAlthough familial occurrence is rare, 30 reported multiplex families support the idea of genetic susceptibility underlying EEC.16 In most of these families, two members are affected. However, in rare cases the inheritance of EEC may be consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance or with an autosomal recessive trait or X-linked transmission.17 These observations indicate that one or more genes with a major effect on the phenotype exist, though in most cases additional causal factors are necessary for the phenotype to occur. A small subgroup of cases may follow Mendelian inheritance whereas in the majority, EEC is inherited as a complex trait with multiple genetic factors (heritable or *de novo *somatic or germ line mutations), and complex gene-gene, or gene-environment interactions contributing to its formation.8\n\nMolecular Genetics of the EEC\n\nCytogenetic and molecular analyses have revealed chromosomal anomalies in 20 EEC patients to date, although none of these appear to be causative.8 Numerical chromosomal aberrations were observed in six patients. In a further four BEX males, one BEX female and one girl with CEX, an association with Down syndrome was found.16 Aneuploidy of sex chromosomes in five of these cases might point to a gonosomal locus involved in the formation of EEC. Structural aberrations have been identified in six EEC cases and one patient simultaneously presenting with CEX and hypomelanosis of Ito. Although the exact breakpoints have not been determined in any of these cases, several translocations involving the region q32-ter on chromosome 9 were detected.\n\nTeratogenic Agents and EEC\n\nTwin studies and epidemiological data suggest environmental factors play a role in the EEC etiology. However, the existing epidemiological studies have not identified major teratogenic factors.4,12,18 Several studies have confirmed that male gender, race, advanced parental age4 and increased parity, even after adjusting for age,19 are predisposing risk factors. Gambhir et al.18 described periconceptional maternal exposure to smoking to be significantly more common in patients with CEX than in a combined group of patients with epispadias and classic BEX. Several reports described the occurrence of EEC in infants resulting from *in vitro *fertilization, but it is still a matter of debate whether the incidence of EEC children conceived by *in vitro *fertilization appears to be higher than expected.8,20\n\nClinical Presentation\n\nAntenatal Period\n\nDespite the magnitude of the defect in the lower abdominal wall and pelvic organ development, exstrophy of the bladder is still difficult to diagnose reliably by prenatal ultrasound.21 This is likely because of its rare incidence and that it is often mistaken for more common diagnoses of omphalocele or gastroschisis.\n\nIt is possible to suspect these conditions during pregnancy when:\n\n\n  The bladder is not identified on successive ultrasounds (absent bladder filling).\n  There is a decrease in the thickness of the abdominal wall.\n  There is a lower abdominal mass which becomes more prominent as the pregnancy progresses.\n  There is a low-set umbilical cord.\n  The genitalia have an abnormal position (anterior or posterior) and there are difficulties determining the sex of the baby\n  The phallus is short.\n  There is an increase in the pelvic diameter, with separation of the pubic rami.\n  There is an omphalocele.\n  There is evidence of anomalies of the lower extremities and/or myelomeningocele (suggestive of cloacal exstrophy).\n\n\nThree-dimensional ultrasound and the increasing use of fetal MRI will improve the ability to diagnose bladder and cloacal exstrophy.21 Antenatal diagnosis allows for prenatal counseling and arrangements to be made for delivery at a specialized exstrophy center. This allows for a multidisciplinary approach by teams with experience dealing with the unique nature of the exstrophy-epispadias complex.\n\nNeonatal Period\n\nMost variants are easily identifiable at birth.\n\n\n  Bladder exstrophy is usually seen more in term infants with good birth weight.\n  Newborns with cloacal exstrophy are usually preterm, and small for the gestational age.\n\n\nChildhood\n\n\n  Infrequent variants may go unnoticed.\n  They are usually identified later in life only by persistent urinary incontinence or gait disturbances.\n\n\nPhysical Exam\n\nIn classic BEX, most abnormalities consist of defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitalia, pelvic bones, and anus, thus involving the lower urinary tract, genitalia, and musculoskeletal system (limbs), while in cloacal exstrophy there is a greater involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and CNS.\n\nClassic Bladder Exstrophy\n\nThe abdominal wall is elongated, and the umbilicus is low-set, located on the upper edge of the bladder plate; it can be associated with a hernial defect or a small omphalocele. The bladder is open anteriorly, with its mucosa fully exposed; polyps may be seen on the surface. Urine drains from the ureteric orifices on the bladder surface. Delayed closure may lead to further inflammatory or mechanical alterations with signs of mucosal inflammation such as a whitish coating, ulcerations, and hyperplastic formations. The para-exstrophic shiny thin skin stripes mark the transition between the normal skin and the squamous metaplastic area. The anus is more anterior, but the sphincteric function is normal. The pubic bones are widely separated and may also be shortened and externally rotated (30%). They are palpable on both sides of the bladder template and the distal end of the triangular edges. Bilateral inguinal hernias are palpable in most patients of both genders.\n\n\n  Female BEX: there is a bifid clitoris, separated labia majora, and a divergent mons pubis (Figure 2). The vagina is shorter than normal, not more than 6 cm deep, but of normal caliber. The vaginal opening is often stenotic and anteriorly placed. As the anus is ventrally positioned as well, the perineum is shortened.\n  Male BEX: The genital defect is severe and is probably one of the most problematic aspects of surgical reconstruction. The urethral plate is open and extends along a short, wide, and dorsally curved phallus, from the open bladder to the glandular grove. Both corpora cavernosa are located beneath the urethral plate. Careful examination reveals the colliculus seminalis and the ductus ejaculatorii as tiny openings in the area, where the prostate is presumably dorsally located. The glans is open and flat (Figure 3), and the normal-sized testes are usually located in the scrotum.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Classic BEX with a low-set umbilicus and an anteriorly placed anus in the perineum. Female BEX with an open bladder and urethral plate, with a split clitoris.\n\n\nFigure 3 Male BEX with a short, wide, and dorsally curved phallus. Abnormal distance between the scrotum and penis.\n\nEpispadias\n\nThe defect results from a developmental arrest in terms of non-closure of the urethral plate and additionally in an abnormal dorsal urethral location. Therefore, in males an ectopic meatus or a mucosal strip is found on the penile dorsum and in females a variable cleft of the urethra is detected.8 Abdominal wall and rectus muscles, as well as the umbilicus, are completely normally developed. The pubic symphysis is usually closed, or only a minor gap is present, indicating only minor pelvic and pelvic floor anomalies. Urinary incontinence appears to be the main clinical symptom, depending on the degree of involvement of the urinary sphincter. In most distal epispadias, involuntary urine loss is not observed, whereas in proximal cases urine is dripping permanently through the meatus. Due to the sometimes “minor” clinical abnormalities, distal epispadias might be missed at birth, especially in girls. Then diagnosis may made later in school age, due to urinary incontinence, resistant to standard treatment.\n\n\n  **Male epispadias (Figure 4): According to the meatal location, epispadias is distinguished as either penopubic, penile or glandular.\n  **Female epispadias (Figure 5): is divided into three degrees according to Davis, either less severe with a gaping meatus, intermediate or severe with a cleft involving the whole urethra and the bladder neck, additionally displaying bladder mucosal prolapse.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 Male epispadias\n\n\nFigure 5 Female epispadias\n\nCloacal Exstrophy\n\nThe rectus muscles and the pubic bones are separated. The bladder is open on the lower abdominal wall and divided into 2 halves adjacent to the exposed segment of the cecum. The openings that communicate the terminal ileum, the appendix (one or two), and the distal intestine are evident within the cecal plate, and the terminal ileum may prolapse as a \"trunk\" through it (elephant trunk appearance). It presents with an imperforate anus and may be associated with an omphalocele. 95% have myelodysplasia and 65% have a malformation of the lower extremities.\n\n\n  \n    Male CEX: the phallus is usually bifid and small, with each hemiglans located caudal to each hemibladder, or it may be absent.\n  \n  \n    Female CEX: the clitoris is bifid and there may be two hemivaginas with a bicornuate uterus (Figure 6).\n  \n\n\n\nFigure 6 Cloacal exstrophy. Giant omphalocoele with 2 hemibladders adjacent to the extrophic caecal plate. Small and bifid phallus, with its hemiglans and a hemiscrotum placed distal to the each bladder plate.\n\nExstrophy Variants\n\nThis includes a clinically wide and heterogeneous spectrum of anomalies. The covered exstrophy appears similar to the classic BEX, with part of the bladder mucosa covered with skin; it may also present as a severe epispadias with a prolapsed bladder. The umbilicus might be at an orthotopic place. Pseudo-exstrophy, however, may be very difficult to identify after birth and is often found at older ages. The genitalia appear normal, and the patients may not have any urinary symptoms, some being completely continent. On physical examination, rectus diastasis of various degrees may be found. The pelvic X-rays could demonstrate an open pubic symphysis, although it is not uncommon for it to be an incidental finding.\n\nAssociated Anomalies\n\nUrological Anomalies\n\nSeveral urological malformations are present in about one third of all EEC cases, predominantly in the EC population (ureteropelvic junction obstruction, ectopic pelvic kidney, horseshoe kidney, renal agenesis, megaureter, ureteral ectopy and ureterocele).1,8 All patients should undergo an antireflux procedure with every bladder neck plasty, as there is a 100% prevalence of bilateral vesicoureteral reflux due to a developmental failure of the ureterovesical junction throughout the EEC spectrum.\n\nSpinal and Orthopaedic Anomalies\n\nhe incidence of spinal anomalies varies within the EEC spectrum. In children born with CEB, spinal anomalies occur in about 7% of cases, whereas a heterogeneous group of congenital spinal anomalies resulting from defective closure of the neural tube early in fetal life and anomalous development of the caudal cell mass can be confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified in nearly 100% of CEX patients.8 A neurological component must be kept in mind in these patients in regards to their bladder and lower extremity function, and erectile capacity.22,23 Skeletal and limb anomalies (clubfoot deformities, absence of feet, tibial or fibular deformities, and hip dislocations) are more commonly seen in CEX.1,8 However, there are no reports about hip dysplasia in long-term follow-up of the EEC.\n\nGastrointestinal Anomalies\n\nThese are predominantly associated with CEX. In addition to a common hindgut remnant of varying size, omphalocoeles are found in 88-100% of CEX cases. Gastrointestinal malrotation or duplication, as well as short bowel syndrome, can be seen in up to 46% of cases.1,8 In about 25% of cases, an either anatomical or functional short bowel syndrome causes absorptive dysfunction.\n\nGynaecological Anomalies\n\nIn addition to the abnormal external genitalia, the cervix inserts low down at the superior vaginal wall close to the introitus in most cases.1,8,24 Nevertheless, the anatomy and function of the uterus and the adnexae are normal. The pelvic floor and the levator defect, together with the absence of the cardinal ligaments, predisposes women to vaginal or uterine prolapse in about 50% of cases. Müllerian anomalies are quite common in CEX, i.e., duplication of the vagina and uterus, vaginal agenesia.1,8\n\nImaging Studies\n\nThey are usually performed to identify and diagnose possible associated anomalies (pelvic and abdominal malformations, spine and vertebral cord anomalies, etc).\n\nThe main studies are renal ultrasound, spinal cord ultrasound, and x-rays of the spine and pelvis. All newborns with CEX should have spinal ultrasound and radiographs to define the individual spinal abnormalities ranging from hemivertebra to myelomeningocele. MRI is further recommended in follow-up to identify occult spinal abnormalities predisposing to symptomatic spinal cord tethering.\n\nSonographic evaluation of the hip joints is of fundamental impact for all EEC patients. Plain pelvic X-ray can be helpful to estimate the dimension of the symphysis gap and the hip localization.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nAntenatally, the EEC can be suspected from the 16th week of gestation. With the advances in the sensitivity of antenatal ultrasonography there has been an increase in prenatal suspicion.\n\nIn most cases the malformation is diagnosed at birth, as it becomes evident clinically.\n\nManagement\n\nIf there is an antenatal diagnosis or suspicion of EEC, the ideal is to counsel the parents and the delivery should be scheduled in a specialized center (refer if necessary). There is no experience that supports the indication of fetal surgery. Vaginal delivery is not recommended due to the increased risk of injury to the bladder plate.\n\nNowadays, it is no longer consider an emergency and/or surgical emergency, allowing for a transfer in safe conditions to specialized centres that can take care of these children with low-frequency and highly complex malformations.\n\nThe surgical approach initially focused on urinary diversion to preserve renal function. However, since the first successful bladder closure was reported by Young in 1942,1,8,11,24,25 significant advances have been made in the areas of staged reconstruction, in the appearance of the external genitalia, and in the preservation of continence and renal function. With improvements in surgical technique, as well as perioperative care, excellent long-term survival can now be expected.\n\nSurgery\n\nThe objectives of the current surgical approach are;1 reconstruction of the abdominal wall,2 relocation and anatomic closure of the exstrophic bladder,3 preserving renal function and achieving urinary continence, and4 reconstruction of the external genitalia.26,27,28,29,30 Historically, the reconstruction was performed in 3 stages beginning in the neonatal period. However, there are currently super-specialized centres or multicentric teams that manage the condition and can organize deferred management, in order to offer the best to each patient by accumulating experience in low-frequency and highly complex pathologies.31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40\n\nThe Surgical Stages are\n\n\n  Closure of the bladder, with approximation of the pubic bones, without the need for osteotomies. In patients with CEX, intestinal diversion should be performed.\n  The second stage consists of complete genital reconstruction. In some centres, the Kelly Procedure or a Radical Soft Tissue Reconstruction is also performed, to achieve bladder continence and a greater penile length in men.\n  Finally, urinary continence should be assessed in the medium to long term. For those cases in which this objective has not been achieved yet or when there is a risk of renal function compromise, there is a third stage in which bladder neck surgery and/or augmentation cystoplasty can be performed with a continent urinary diversion for clean intermittent catheterization.\n\n\nIn various super-specialized centres around the world, delayed closure at two to four months of age has been chosen, performing a single-stage approach, together with the surgery described by Kelly,26,30,39 which includes:1 dissection and bladder closure with or without an antireflux procedure (if bladder size and wall characteristics allow it);2 the radical soft tissue mobilization with disinsertion from the pubic rami;3 the creation of a bladder neck or continence mechanism with the help of the Peña stimulator to identify the neo-muscular sphincter complex and4 penile reconstruction or introitoplasty.\n\nThe benefits of this approach are that prior surgery in the neonatal period is avoided, allowing for the presence of the native tissues, and avoiding scarring and fibrosis generated by primary closure. This also favors parental attachment and the development of a bond between the child and their parents, without the need for a prolonged hospitalization within the first days of life.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that delayed bladder closure can be performed safely and successfully, and that in principle it does not affect bladder development. Delaying surgery allows for maturation of the newborn, with the consequent reduction in the risks of a prolonged anesthesia and favors the growth of the infant during the period of mini-puberty, in addition to promoting the preparation of the team of experts for each case.39\n\nComplications\n\nBecause of its complexity and very low frequency, these conditions present a series of complications mostly associated with the reconstructive surgery:34,39\n\n\n  Early: surgical wound dehiscence, bladder prolapse, urethral or vesicocutaneous fistulae (4 – 19%), urethral stenosis (8%), penile ischemia.\n  Late: VUR, recurrent UTIs, incomplete bladder emptying, urinary incontinence, bladder lithiasis, abdominal wall fibrosis, bladder rupture, uterine prolapse, renal failure, retrograde ejaculation, oligospermia and infertility, and short gut syndrome and fecal incontinence (cloacal exstrophy).\n\n\nPrognosis\n\nIf these patients are left untreated, they would suffer from recurrent urinary tract infections, permanent urinary incontinence and problems with sexual activity, also having a higher risk of bladder cancer, which together means a poorer quality of life.26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35\n\nHowever, if proper management of the condition is accomplished as suggested, these patients have a quality of life expectancy that is probably similar to that of the general population. It is also estimated that they will potentially be able to live an absolutely normal life, considering that in more than 90% of cases there is no association with other congenital malformations. In addition, these patients could develop urinary continence without requiring a bladder augmentation or intermittent catheterization for emptying, even though the success rate is reserved (only 23% of voluntary urination per urethra with the MSRE technique,41 39% with the CPRE technique,28 and 53% with the Kelly technique26).\n\nTable 1 Wide range of continence rate of the different approaches depending on definition of continence and observation period.42\n\n\n  \n    \n      Approach\n      Continence rate (%)\n      Literature\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      MSRE\n      74\n      Gearhart et al\n    \n    \n       \n      62\n      Gupta et al\n    \n    \n       \n      22\n      Dickson et al\n    \n    \n      CPRE\n      80\n      Grady et al\n    \n    \n       \n      74\n      Hammouda et al\n    \n    \n       \n      23\n      Arab et al\n    \n    \n      RSTM\n      73\n      Kelly et al\n    \n    \n       \n      70\n      Jarzebowski et al\n    \n    \n       \n      33–67 (female)\n      Cuckow et al\n    \n    \n       \n      44–81 (male)\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nCurrently, these patients have excellent long-term survival, achieving urinary continence in up to 75-80% of patients with bladder exstrophy and 65-70% in cases of cloacal exstrophy;39,43,41 however, many of them require permanent urinary and intestinal diversions. Generally, sexual function is preserved, and most patients are fertile. Delivery by cesarean section is recommended in female patients who underwent surgery to avoid damage to the continence mechanisms.\n\nReferences\n\n\nGearhart JP, Gearhart JP, Rink RC.

        "title": "Posterior Urethral Valves and Infravesical Obstruction",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nPosterior urethral valves (PUV) remains the most common congenital cause of bladder outflow obstruction in male neonates. It is the leading cause of End stage renal disease (ESRD) in male children.1 The vast majority of cases nowadays are suspected antenatally and referred to specialist centers after birth. Additionally, there is a low threshold for investigating a male child with a urinary tract infection and therefore timely diagnosis is usually the norm. The spectrum of renal dysfunction and subsequent functional outcomes vary widely in children with this condition. PUV and its consequences, including renal dysplasia, upper tract dilatation, vesico-ureteric reflux, urinary tract infection and bladder dysfunction, accounts for 25–30% of pediatric renal transplantations in the UK (UK Transplant Registry).\n\nThis chapter aims to provide an updated overview on posterior urethral valves and how they are managed at our center.\n\nEmbryology\n\nThere are two distinct theories to explain the origin of PUVs. The first theory postulates an anomalous insertion of the mesonephric duct into the uro-genital sinus, preventing normal migration of these ducts and their anterior fusion. The other theory suggests that valves represent a persistent urogenital membrane.2 Early classification of PUV was done by Hugh Hampton Young in 1919, which described types I-III based on post-mortem dissection studies. Later studies suggested a more uniform appearance to the obstructing posterior urethral membrane and the prospective assessment of non-instrumented urethras by Dewan et al, found similar appearances in all cases studied.3 Their endoscopic appraisal revealed the membrane to attach posteriorly, just distal to the verumontanum. The membrane extended anteriorly and obliquely beyond the external sphincter with a variable sized aperture located within it, at the level of the verumontanum and they described the condition as congenital obstructing posterior urethral membrane (COPUM).\n\nIncidence and Genetic Aspects\n\nCommonly reported incidence of PUV is 1 in 5000 live births with 50% of these progressing to ESRD within 10 years.4 It has shown some variation with an incidence of 1:7800 in Australia and 1 in 3800 in the UK and Ireland.5,6 The understanding of the genetic basis, or potential environmental or maternal factors for this anomaly, continues to evolve. Chiraramonte et al have proposed a specific role of the short arm of chromosome 11.7 Associated anomalies will be present in about 40% of these boys mainly of the cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system and other urological conditions such as Hypospadias, Micro/ Macro phallus and anterior urethral valves.8,9,10 There have been reports of absent external auditory meatus, bilateral adrenal agenesis in boys with PUV valves.\n\nPrenatal Diagnosis\n\nThe number of cases of PUV diagnosed prenatally has increased with the increased utilization and sensitivity of prenatal anomaly scanning. In the UK, there are at least two scans performed for pregnant women. The first is a dating scan done around 10–12 weeks gestation. The second is a more detailed anomaly scan at around 20 weeks gestation. Approximately half to two thirds of boys with PUV will be suspected prenatally. Prenatal findings on ultrasonography in suspected cases may include a thick-walled bladder, the ‘keyhole’ sign with a dilated bladder and posterior urethra, unilateral or bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, echo bright kidneys and oligohydramnios. The differential diagnosis includes prune belly syndrome, urethral atresia, bilateral vesicoureteric reflux and, less frequently, the megacystis-microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis disorder. The recent BAPS CASS National Audit identified 35% of PUV prenatally and about 40% in the first year of life.6 This audit also has shown a statistically significant relationship between timing of diagnosis and increased risk of renal impairment.\n\nPrenatal Intervention\n\nAntenatal interventions for posterior urethral valves include bladder aspiration, vesico-amniotic shunt placement and fetal endoscopic valve ablation. The rationale is that early decompression of the fetal renal tract will allow improved survival with preservation of renal function, a reduction in the respiratory compromise and limb abnormalities seen in association with severe oligohydramnios. However, normal amniotic fluid volume is not a guarantee of good postnatal renal function. A study by the North American Fetal Therapy Network studied the outcome of 32 consecutive pregnancies with LUTO and normal mid-gestational amniotic fluid volume.11 Perinatal survival was 97%. Renal replacement therapy was needed where there was development of oligohydramnios and/or anhydramnios, cortical renal cysts, PUV, prematurity, and prolonged neonatal intensive care unit stay as per the univariate analysis. By multivariate analysis, the only predictor for RRT was preterm delivery.\n\nHistorically, the algorithm introduced by Johnson in 1994 has been used to select fetuses for prenatal intervention.12 The criteria include a normal male karyotype in the absence of other fetal anomalies that would adversely affect prognosis, and maternal oligo/anhydramnios or decreasing amniotic fluid volumes. could benefit from intervention. In recent years, Ruano et al proposed a patient selection model based on 4 stages of obstruction. Fetal intervention is not recommended for Stage III-IV.13\n\nTable 1 Ruano’s staging system\n\n\n  \n    \n       \n      Fetal USS\n      Fetal Biochemistry 18-30 weeks\n      Possible therapies\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Stage 1\n      Normal AFI No renal cysts or dysplasia\n      Favorable after sequential sampling\n      Weekly USS monitoring\n    \n    \n      Stage 2\n      Oligohydramnios Severe bilateral hydronephrosis Absent cysts or dysplasia\n      Favorable after maximum of 3 sequential samplings\n      Cystoscopy or Vesicoamniotic shunting\n    \n    \n      Stage 3\n      Anhyramnios or oligohydramnios Hyperechogenic kidneys Renal cysts and/or dysplasia\n      Unfavorable after sequential sampling\n      VAS with possible amnioinfusion\n    \n    \n      Stage 4\n      Anhydramnios and anuria after monitoring bladder filling rate.

Five studies showed that postnatal renal function was higher in the VAS group as compared to conservative group. Two studies involving 45 fetuses undergoing fetal cystoscopy demonstrated that perinatal survival was higher in the cystoscopy group compared to the conservative management group. Normal renal function was noted in 13/34 fetuses in the cystoscopy group versus 12/61 in the conservative management group at 6 months follow-up.\n\nMore recently, an attempt was made to address the question of benefit of prenatal intervention in the form of vesico-amniotic shunting in suspected bladder outflow obstruction. The PLUTO trial was set up as a pan-European multi-center trial.15 Entry into this trial was based on the uncertainty principle. In the event of doubt of the benefit of intervention, patients were randomized to vesico-amniotic shunting or no treatment. Outcome measures included postnatal mortality, renal function assessed by serum creatinine at age 1 year and any associated morbidity or complications of the procedure. The trial ran for 5 years but was unable to recruit the required number of patients and is now closed. Unfortunately, due to the small number of patients recruited it failed to identify if prenatal intervention is of significant benefit in treatment of suspected bladder outflow obstruction.\n\nNeonatal Management\n\nFor those neonates suspected of having PUV prenatally, with no concerns about amniotic fluid volume, the delivery may take place outside of specialist pediatric urology centers. The priority is to drain the bladder using a size 6/8 Fr non-balloon urethral catheter. Antibiotic prophylaxis must be started, e.g., trimethoprim 2 mg/kg. A non-balloon catheter is safer than a balloon catheter especially in inexperienced hands. There is a possibility of causing urethral trauma by inflating the balloon in the posterior urethra rather than the bladder.\n\nIn those neonates where it is not possible to catheterize urethrally, usually due to either non-availability of a 6 Fr catheter or a very high bladder neck that precludes successful catheterization, a supra-pubic catheter becomes necessary. Following successful bladder drainage, close attention should be paid to urine output and electrolyte measurements as these patients may develop post obstructive diuresis resulting in abnormalities of sodium, potassium and bicarbonate levels. Creatinine should be monitored on a daily basis until a nadir creatinine level is achieved. For patients with significant renal dysfunction and electrolyte disturbance, a nephrology colleague should be involved from an early stage to optimize renal function and homeostasis.\n\nIn boys born with a history of oligohydramnios and significant pulmonary hypoplasia the priority of management is respiratory support and bladder drainage. Either a urethral or supra-pubic catheter is sufficient to optimize urinary drainage whilst awaiting homeostasis and respiratory stability.\n\nNeonates and infants who were not suspected to have PUV prenatally may present with urosepsis, obstructive voiding symptoms, a distended bladder or palpable kidneys and the principles of management are the same. While poor urinary stream is suggestive of bladder outflow obstruction, the observation of a normal urinary stream does not exclude the diagnosis.\n\nConfirming Diagnosis in the Neonatal Period\n\nOnce the neonate has been stabilized the diagnosis must be confirmed. Renal ultrasound scan (USS) will give information on the size and quality of the renal parenchyma, degree of hydroureteronephrosis and assessment of bladder wall thickness. It may also show a dilated posterior urethra.\n\nMicturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) will confirm the diagnosis and must include catheter-out views to demonstrate the caliber of the posterior urethra (Figure 1) The child is covered with a 3-day course of antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection and urosepsis.\n\n\nFigure 1 MCUG demonstrating dilated posterior urethra, irregular bladder and bilateral vesico-ureteric reflux.\n\nAdditional information obtained from the MCUG includes bladder size, bladder irregularity from thickening, trabeculation and diverticula formation, vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) and the configuration of the bladder neck. Approximately 50% of neonates with PUV will have VUR. If the VUR has been high grade and unilateral, a “pop-off” may have allowed selective dissipation of back pressure, resulting from urethral obstruction.\n\nThe VURD (valves unilateral reflux dysplasia) syndrome described by Hoover and Duckett results in very poor or non-function of the kidney on the refluxing side with a relative sparing of renal function on the contralateral, non-refluxing side.16 These authors also postulated that this mechanism of ‘pop-off’ results in long-term normal renal function, as the contralateral kidney is spared and normal. This hypothesis was subsequently challenged by Cuckow et al who showed with serum creatinine and GFR measurements that renal function was impaired in cases with VURD, implying that the protection offered by the ‘pop-off’ mechanism was not complete.17\n\nPrimary Valve Resection\n\nThe procedure of choice for PUV is primary valve ablation which is performed once the baby is stable from a medical point of view. At induction of anesthesia a dose of intravenous antibiotic is given, e.g., co-amoxiclav 30mg/kg. The baby is placed in the lithotomy position and a diagnostic cystoscopy using 0° 6/8 Fr neonatal cystoscope performed. The posterior urethra should be carefully inspected and the valve configuration noted. The configuration of the bladder neck and appearances of the bladder and ureteric orifices should also be noted. The 11 Fr resectoscope is assembled with either the cold/sickle blade or Bugbee electrode and valve resection is typically performed at the 5, 7 and 12 o’clock positions (Figure 2)\n\n\nFigure 2 Endoscopic view of PUV with the sites for valve incision marked.\n\nA urethral catheter is placed at the end of the procedure and removed 24-48 hours later. The creatinine should be checked following catheter removal and the nappies weighed to document urine output. Antibiotic prophylaxis and renal supplements should continue until further review.\n\nThe complications of primary valve ablation include bleeding, incomplete valve resection, urethral stricture or inadvertent damage to the external sphincter. The choice of technique is dictated by the instruments available, caliber of the neonatal urethra and the size and maturity of the baby.\n\nFor preterm or very small neonates, endoscopic resection is delayed due to the difficulties of the small caliber of the urethra and potential complications of using the relatively larger instruments. These children may be managed with a urethral or supra-pubic catheter until such time as they are big enough for the procedure. As a rough guide, a body weight of 2.5 kg should allow safe and accurate PUV resection with standard endoscopic instruments.\n\nFor some small neonates there may be repeated issues with urethral or suprapubic catheters falling out, becoming blocked or dislodged or not draining adequately and in these circumstances formation of a vesicostomy may be considered the safest option to ensure adequate and continuous bladder drainage.\n\nIt is our recommendation that all boys have a follow-up cystoscopy within 3 months of the primary procedure to ensure completeness of valve ablation. This is due to the poor correlation of repeat MCUG in diagnosing residual valve leaflets and cystoscopic appraisal of residual valve leaflets requiring further resection; positive predictive valve 56%.18 However, some centers would choose to perform a repeat MCUG at this stage and proceed to cystoscopy only if the MCUG suggests persisting urethral obstruction. A further advantage of proceeding directly to check cystoscopy is that it provides an opportunity to perform circumcision which has been shown to reduce the rate of urinary tract infection by at least 83% in boys with posterior urethral valves.19 This has been validated by a recent multi center RCT, CIRCUP trial. In the study population of 91 boys, the probability of presenting with a febrile UTI was 20% in the antibiotic group versus 3% in the circumcision + antibiotic group.20\n\nPresentation, Diagnosis and Management in the Older Child\n\nA smaller number of patients with PUV will not present as neonates or infants but attend clinics in childhood or early adolescence with symptoms of diurnal enuresis, dribbling or poor urine stream, infection or less commonly hematuria. A careful voiding history may suggest the diagnosis and non-invasive studies, such as flow rates and measurement of post-void residual volumes, may also point to the abnormality. Urethral catheterization in the older child is invasive and fraught with difficulties; therefore, our preference is to omit the MCUG and instead, proceed directly to a diagnostic cystoscopy and primary valve ablation if the diagnosis is confirmed. Follow-up after successful complete valve ablation is as outlined below with a greater suspicion of persistent bladder dysfunction in those presenting late.\n\nFollow-Up\n\nEach institution will have a unique follow-up regimen for children with posterior urethral valves.

The aim in these children is to maximize their renal potential and to delay or avoid renal replacement. Early urinary diversion, either by vesicostomy or bilateral ureterostomy or pyelostomy, aims to protect the upper tracts and minimize the risks of infection.\n\nChua et al did a retrospective review of 40 boys with either valve ablation alone or ablation + vesicostomy/ supravesical diversion. They noted that urinary diversion following valve ablation in children with stage 3 chronic kidney disease associated with posterior urethral valves may temporarily delay progression to end stage renal disease. Therefore, this may not provide any long term benefits and is more of a temporizing measure.21 This reiterates the findings of previous work by Tietjen and Lopez-Pereira at al.22,23\n\nThe concept of a refluxing ureterostomy as a form of urinary diversion has shown some promise. This is an elegant technique that allows bladder cycling to continue and at the same time dissipates the high storage and voiding pressures that are present in the valve bladder at this age. The primary requirement is a freely refluxing ureter and the procedure is carried out through a low groin skin crease incision. The ureter is identified and isolated extra-vesically in the retroperitoneum. A loop refluxing ureterostomy is then fashioned and will drain into the nappy. Unlike the end ureterostomy, reversal is relatively easy. Once the procedure has served its purpose or stops refluxing, the ureterostomy is simply closed and the ureter returned to the retroperitoneal space. The refluxing ureterostomy is particularly useful in boys with fragile renal function, as it will minimize the potential detrimental effects of the high-pressure bladder that is present in the early period following valve ablation. This is critical in the management of these neonates as renal replacement in infancy is extremely precarious and difficult to maintain.\n\nThere have been legitimate concerns that bypassing the bladder or having a continuously empty bladder may negatively impact future bladder function. Additionally, there is a lack of convincing evidence that urinary diversion improves long-term renal function.\n\nWhen comparing primary valve ablation with primary vesicostomy, Godbole et al found no significant difference in serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 1 year of age between the two groups.24 The group who had vesicostomy formation as their primary procedure had been diverted for a median time of 18 months and 7 boys who had subsequent urodynamics demonstrated a normal bladder capacity. Jaureguizar et al compared bladder function outcomes in boys treated with supravesical diversion with primary valve ablation alone.25 The mean time for which supravesical diversion was present was 13 months and all were diverted in the first 2 months of life. They carried out invasive urodynamic studies at age 9–10 years and found very similar proportions of normal, poorly compliant, unstable and decompensated bladders in both groups.\n\nMore favorable bladder outcomes, improved capacity, lower detrusor end-fill pressure at expected bladder capacity, and less frequent detrusor instability have been demonstrated in 8 patients managed with primary valve ablation compared to 11 boys managed with high and low loop ureterostomy.26 The urodynamic studies were performed in these boys at a minimal mean age of 11 years and the duration of diversion was a mean of 57 months.\n\nThus, the place of early urinary diversion in the management of boys with PUV is limited. It has the potential to improve renal function in the short-term which is very important in boys with fragile kidney function and can defer renal replacement to a later stage. There is no convincing evidence to support its role as a way of improving long-term renal function and the jury is out on its effect on long-term bladder function. Therefore, urinary diversion must be considered in selected cases with clear goals and endpoints in mind and has a role in the management of boys with PUV.\n\nLong-Term Outcomes: Upper Urinary Tract\n\nUrine production begins at 8-9 weeks gestation and the collecting system is formed by the end of the first trimester. The fetal bladder can be seen soon after this on prenatal ultrasound. The presence of bladder outflow obstruction transmits raised intraluminal pressure to the developing renal parenchyma and once a critical level is reached causes apoptosis, abnormal cellular differentiation and glomerular changes that occur within the kidney. These early changes dictate the functional renal potential in later life. In cases where the obstruction is less severe or declares itself later in pregnancy, the effects of obstruction tend to be more on the bladder and renal effects are limited to dilatation of the collecting system with minimal disruption of normal nephrogenesis. An alternative or perhaps supplementary theory to explain the renal dysplasia seen in conjunction with posterior urethral valves relates to abnormal position of the ureteric bud and implantation into the metanephric blastema.27 Renal dysfunction thus appears to be the result of varying degrees of inherent dysplasia and the effects of bladder outflow obstruction. In post-natal life these effects can be further exaggerated by urinary tract infections, VUR and bladder dysfunction\n\nWhen there is a significant loss of nephrons, hyperfiltration of existing functional nephrons occurs via vasodilatation of the afferent arterioles. The resultant glomerular capillary hypertension allows for normal renal function to be temporarily maintained. Over time this compensatory mechanism decompensates, glomerulosclerosis ensues, with resulting proteinuria, hypertension and a reduced glomerular filtration rate. Damage to the distal nephron impairs the concentrating ability of the kidney resulting in polyuria and polydipsia (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), which can worsen bladder function and thereby further risk upper tract function.\n\nThe paper by Parkhouse et al is often quoted and describes the long-term outcomes of 98 boys diagnosed with posterior urethral valves presenting between 1966-1975, before the era of antenatal diagnosis.28 The follow-up period of this study ranged from 11 to 22 years. 66% of the cohort presented in the first year of life and half of the cohort of patients were managed with primary valve ablation, the remainder being diverted. 32% (31 patients) had a ‘bad long-term renal outcome;’ 10 patients died of acute renal failure, 15 developed end-stage renal disease and 6 had established chronic renal impairment over the follow-up period. Presentation under the age of one year (p&lt;0.05), presence of bilateral vesico-ureteric reflux (p&lt;0.0010), a plasma urea on initial discharge of &gt;10 mmol/litre, and at age 5 years, presence of proteinuria (p&lt;0.001) along with persistent urinary incontinence were all associated with a poor renal outcome.\n\nMore contemporary series report rather similar results. Kousidis et al reported a series of 42 patients with pre and postnatally diagnosed posterior urethral valves between 1984–1996.29 The follow-up period was 10-23 years. There were 3 (7%) deaths (2 in the neonatal period and 1 patient age 3 years following unsuccessful transplantation), 11 patients (26 %) had progressed to end-stage renal failure, one of these occurring only in the late teenage years.\n\nIn a group of 65 PUV patients presenting during 1987–2004 and followed over a shorter time period (range 1–14.3 years; median follow-up 6.8 years), Sarhan et al found a 17% overall rate of renal impairment of whom 9% had progressed to ESRD.30 Early gestational age at diagnosis (&lt;24 weeks; p=0.003) and pre-natal oligohydramnios or anhydramnios (p=0.02) was associated with a poor outcome. There were no deaths in this group but during the same study period there were 14 fetuses with a prenatal diagnosis in which the pregnancy was terminated. Fetal urine analysis had been done in all cases and post mortem findings confirmed severe renal histological changes. This suggests that the overall incidence of renal failure, taking into account the fetuses that were terminated, is similar to the other studies mentioned above.\n\nDeFoor’s larger group of 119 PUV patients followed for a similar length of time, (range 3–24 years; mean follow-up 7.2 years), found 13% to have developed end stage renal failure by a median age of 8.2 years (range 7 days–17.5 years).31 In this study, bladder dysfunction, necessitating clean intermittent catheterisation and/or use of anti-cholinergic medication, was associated with an increased risk of ESRD. Nadir serum creatinine &gt; 1.0 mg/dl was also associated with an increased risk of ESRD (OR 71, CI 10–482) and this has been borne out in several previous and subsequent studies where serum creatinine &lt;1.0 mg/dl at 1 year of age affords a good long-term renal outcome.\n\nHeikkila et al have evaluated a larger cohort of patients (n=193) with posterior urethral valves over a much longer period of time (range 6–69 years; median follow-up 31 years).32 Rate of progression to end stage renal failure was 22.8%, with 68% developing ESRF before the age of 17 years and the remainder after the age of 17 years. The deterioration in renal function around the time of puberty in children with dysplastic kidneys is well recognized, and a likely explanation is that it represents changes within the kidney in response to growth, increased body mass and increased blood pressure.33 However, this late deterioration in renal function after puberty highlighted by this paper highlights the need for follow-up of these patients into adulthood and beyond.\n\nPereira et al in their series of 77 PUV cases, diagnosed &lt; 6 months of age and followed for an average of 11.7 years, saw that 27 (35.1%) had CRF, 14 of whom were in ESRD. Of these 27 boys in CRF, 22 progressed to CRF in the first 3 years of life: 4 at between age of 15-16 and 1 at 20 years of age.34\n\nThe onset of ESRD remains unpredictable. Proteinuria can signify onset of deterioration of renal function and must be monitored. Polyuria may increase postvoid residual volumes, causing progressive uropathy and a deterioration in the concentrating ability of the renal medulla that further compounds polyuria, creating a cycle of decline. Good bladder emptying is vital; in extreme cases, overnight bladder drainage may delay renal deterioration and can improve sleep for patients with polyuria.35\n\nVesicoureteral Reflux\n\nAt presentation, approximately 50% of patients have vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) on the initial MCUG. This is believed to be secondary to the bladder outflow obstruction and co-existent bladder dysfunction. Approximately 15% of patients will demonstrate unilateral high grade VUR with non-function of the ipsilateral kidney. Following valve ablation the severity of VUR may decrease or resolve completely in 25-50% of cases, and this improvement is more likely in those presenting as neonates or during infancy. Persistent VUR, especially high grade and bilateral, after successful valve ablation is associated with poor long-term renal outcome and is one of the poor prognostic indicators identified by Parkhouse et al.28 There is no longer the trend to perform anti-reflux procedures in boys with PUV, as failure rates associated with this approach are high. In cases where the grade of reflux is high and associated with poor function in the ipsilateral kidney, the capacious ureter has been used to augment the bladder in association with removal of the non-functioning kidney. Other innovative strategies include creating a refluxing ureterostomy as previously discussed and occasionally the distal ureter has been used as a Mitrofanoff channel with or without an associated anti-reflux procedure. Persistent higher grades of reflux are a potential risk factor for recurrent urinary infection and can impact negatively on transplanted kidneys and are therefore usually treated surgically prior to renal transplantation.\n\nIn a recent RCT, Abdelhalim et al, saw some improvement of reflux after valve ablation with oxybutynin. There were 24 patients in the oxybutynin arm and 25 in the control arm. Renal units in the oxybutynin group had a greater likelihood of hydronephrosis improvement (61.9% vs 34.8%, p=0.011) and resolution of vesicoureteral reflux (62.5% vs 25%, p=0.023).36\n\nHydroureteronephrosis\n\nMajority of neonates presenting with posterior urethral valves will demonstrate bilateral hydro-ureteronephrosis. This is often seen to improve with initial catheterization but may temporarily worsen due to functional obstruction at the level of the VUJ by the thickened bladder wall that collapses, pinching off the ureteric orifices following catheterisation and decompression. It is important to recognize this phenomenon and occasionally this can result in anuria that lasts for 24-48 hours. The obstruction spontaneously resolves within 48-72 hours and is usually followed by post-obstructive diuresis. It is important to keep a steady nerve and resist the temptation to try and decompress the upper tracts with either internal JJ stenting or placement of nephrostomies. After primary valve ablation one should anticipate the degree of upper tract dilatation to gradually improve or resolve completely.37 This improvement will be influenced by ongoing VUR, bladder dysfunction, polyuria and abnormal ureteric motility and all these factors must be accounted for when assessing outcomes following valve ablation. Ureteric re-implantation with or without tapering is no longer performed in the context of worsening hydro-ureteronephrosis in cases of PUV as the role of the bladder and its associated dysfunction and renal tubular dysfunction with resultant polyuria have become increasingly acknowledged with improved understanding of the pathophysiology of bladder outflow obstruction.\n\nLong-Term Outcomes: Lower Urinary Tract\n\nThe underlying etiology of bladder behavior in posterior urethral valves remains a topic of much debate. The two main culprits implicated in the etiology are that the abnormal bladder is the result of in-utero changes in response to outflow obstruction and/or that the bladder dysfunction is the result of urinary diversion. The jury is out on the second theory, as currently, the majority of cases are not diverted although the incidence of bladder dysfunction remains high. Godbole et al have shown that diversion is not necessarily detrimental to outcome of bladder function and may even improve it.24\n\nHistologically, the obstructed bladder in fetal animal models demonstrates an increase in smooth muscle mass, an increase in the number of muscarinic receptors and increased collagen deposition. But more recent work implicates increased fibrosis in the pathogenesis of bladder dysfunction.38 A paper by one of the authors of this chapter has identified that replacement of smooth muscle with fibrosis is a major contributory factor in contractile dysfunction in the hypertonic PUV bladder. This opens the avenues for research into potential of antifibrotic agents for restoring normal contractility.39\n\nResearchers have also demonstrated reversibility in some of these changes with removal of obstruction although recovery may be partial depending on the timing of reversal and the degree of irreversible damage that has already occurred. The early presentation that results from prenatal diagnosis allows for prompt treatment and therefore it would be reasonable to expect improved outcomes for bladder function in the current population of boys with prenatally suspected bladder outflow obstruction.\n\nThe term ‘valve bladder syndrome’ was introduced as a concept in the 1980s to encompass the abnormal voiding patterns and symptoms of voiding dysfunction, a persistent thick walled bladder, incomplete bladder emptying and associated upper tract dilatation seen in many boys with treated posterior urethral valves. Peters et al, in their cohort of 41 boys who were evaluated mainly for persistent urinary incontinence and ‘valve bladder syndrome,’ found three dominant urodynamic patterns on invasive testing; the overactive bladder and poorly-compliant blandder or acontractile bladder with some overlap between these patterns.40\n\nOver the last 30 years clinicians have begun to recognize and understand the importance of bladder dysfunction and its impact outcome of both urinary continence and renal function in boys with posterior urethral valves. Marked differences in the technique of urodynamics, classification of different patterns and timing of examinations are seen when reviewing the literature on this topic.\n\nHolmdahl et al followed 12 boys with PUV under the age of 15 years. Instability during urodynamic filling was observed in 2/3 of patients at 5 years of age but by puberty this had reduced.41 Bladder capacity at age 5 years appeared to be normal but after puberty capacity was shown to be approximately twice expected capacity. The urodynamic pattern changed over time with instability decreasing in favor of an over distended pattern with increasing age. This change in bladder behavior was also shown by De Gennaro et al, where 71% of 48 patients studied had abnormal urodynamic studies between ages 10 months-15 years.42 In the age group &lt;8 years, 44% had hyper contractile and 31% hypo contractile bladders and patients &gt;8 years demonstrated 28 % hyper contractile and 50% hypo contractile urodynamic patterns. Misseri et al demonstrated a lower rate (5.9%) of myogenic failure (acontractile or unable to generate a sustained detrusor contraction for adequate bladder emptying) in their retrospective study of 51 boys and concluded that the detrusor failure was due to co-existing anti-cholinergic treatment in their cohort of cases.43\n\nBladder dysfunction is key to long term renal function outcomes as illustrated in the long term follow-up study by Parkhouse et al, where the finding of incontinence at 5 years in 44% of patients, defined as not being dry during the day, was associated with a poor renal outcome in 46% of this group (p&lt;0.001).20,24 In Ansari’s group of 227 boys with posterior urethral valves, they showed an overall 30% risk of developing chronic kidney disease with 10% progressing to end stage renal failure.1 Severe bladder dysfunction, defined as low compliance with end filling pressure &gt;40 cm of H20 or post-void residual volume &gt;30% or underactive detrusor or the need for CIC, was more prevalent in the patients progressing to ESRD (p&lt;0.0001). Mazen’s study of 116 patients with PUV followed for a mean of 10.3 years (range 18 months–22 years) found 42% of patients had ESRF or had been transplanted. Urodynamic abnormalities were observed in 80% of the overall patient group and bladder instability and poor compliance were correlated with a poor renal functional outcome (p=0.04).44\n\nIn the cohort of prenatally treated PUV, the data pertaining to bladder dysfunction is scarce. Abbo et al. compared the outcome of 38 prenatally diagnosed and 31 postnatally diagnosed boys, with PUV revealing no significant difference in the incidence of voiding dysfunction (27% vs. 31%) at 7.2 years’ follow-up.45\n\nBladder function continues to evolve through adolescence and effective bladder management must continue into adulthood. Prostatic growth alters the dynamics of bladder outflow and the changing pattern of bladder dynamics seen in early childhood continues to change through adolescence with enlarged bladder capacity and large post-void residual volumes being most prevalent. Some young men may have to initiate clean intermittent catheterization to address this irreversible deterioration in bladder function.\n\nRenal Transplantation\n\nWith a significant number of boys with PUV progressing to end-stage renal failure, the importance of a comprehensive bladder assessment as part of the pre-transplant work-up cannot be over-emphasized. A high pressure, poorly compliant, low capacity bladder may put at risk the transplanted kidney and graft loss becomes a real possibility. Five year graft survival rates in the PUV population have improved over the last 2 decades from 40% in the 1980s to 70% in the 1990s to near 90% in the 2000s.46\n\nFor those patients who require surgical intervention to achieve a bladder which is considered a ‘safe’ receptacle for the transplant there are divided opinions as to whether this surgery should be performed before or after transplantation. Performing bladder augmentation with/without a catheterisable conduit prior to renal transplant allows post-operative healing without immuno-suppression but risks a ‘dry cystoplasty’ which must be managed by bladder cycling and lavages especially if there is no or minimal native urine production. Additional risk with this approach is that this major surgery may tip the fragile renal function over the edge and accelerate the need for replacement therapy and temporary dialysis in the pre-emptive transplant scenario. With pre-transplant bladder augmentation any additional procedures, including transplantation itself, must not damage the vascular pedicle to the augmentation particularly when there is a short time interval between the procedures and extra care must be taken to ensure the safety of the reconstructed bladder. For those patients in whom augmentation cystoplasty is performed after renal transplantation it is important that immuno-suppression requirements have been stabilized and the improved renal function offers clear advantages. In this scenario the transplant ureter may be reimplanted into the native bladder or brought out as a cutaneous ureterostomy. Jesus and Pippi Salle concluded after a review of available literature that augmentation increases the risk of UTI after transplantation.47 They agreed that preemptive augmentation should be constructed only in selected cases, where the risks associated with increased bladder pressures exceed the ones arising with augmentation and UTIs. Knowing that a significant number of PUV boys will develop myogenic failure, augmentation can be delayed as long as they remain under close surveillance. In the context of posterior urethral valves and renal transplantation it is crucial that continued surveillance of bladder function continues after transplantation. Riley et al gives a comprehensive review of the different strategies of managing the bladder in the context of lower urinary tract dysfunction and renal transplantation.48\n\nFertility\n\nThere are few studies reporting on fertility and paternity outcomes in men with a history of posterior urethral valves. Persisting dilatation of the posterior urethra, damage to tissues around the verumontanum or secondary urethral strictures resulting from previous surgery will all influence the efficacy of ejaculation. Erectile dysfunction is seen more commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease and those on dialysis. In 9 patients with a history of PUV studied by Woodhouse , the semen analysis was considered within the normal range whilst in 6 men who submitted semen for analysis to Lopez Pereira, 2 patients had abnormal forms or high percentage of immotile sperm.49,50\n\nFurther Research Avenues\n\nPosterior urethral valve management provides a lot of scope for exploration into novel strategies of prediction of outcomes and survival. A recent machine learning tool has been developed by Kwong et al to predict clinically relevant outcomes. This shows some promise and warrants further validation.51\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Posterior urethral valves remains the most common cause of neonatal bladder outflow obstruction in males.\n  An increasing number of cases are diagnosed antenatally but prenatal intervention does not appear to confer a benefit in the long-term outcome of renal function.\n  Primary valve ablation is the recommended treatment of choice with diversion being reserved for specific individual cases.\n  A significant number of boys with PUV will develop chronic kidney disease and end stage renal failure.\n  Structured follow-up aims to prevent upper tract deterioration, prevent urinary tract infection, maximize growth and allow surveillance for bladder dysfunction in both pre and post-transplant patients with PUV.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAnsari MS.

        "title": "Duplex Urethral Anomalies and Syringocoele",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nUrethral anomalies are congenital disorders that are not uncommon, with some rare variations. This chapter will focus on embryology, epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, repair, follow-up, and complications of some anterior urethral anomalies, including anterior urethral valve (AUV), syringocele, urethral duplication and megalourethra. Some even believe that these anomalies, except duplication, are the same and a spectrum.\n\nEmbryology\n\nMale urethral development originates with the urogenital sinus cavity extending onto the surface of the genital tubercle during week 6 of gestation. This endodermal derived groove becomes a solid plate of cells, which eventually tabularises in proximal-to-distal fashion to form the phallic urethra. The appearance is identical in male and female fetuses until week nine, and by week 14, the male urethra is complete in its development. The urethra has been divided into four distinct regions, each with its unique anatomical classification and predominant histological cell type of the urethral mucosa. The prostatic urethra and membranous urethra are most proximal, derived from the urogenital sinus and composed of delicate transitional epithelium. Next is the bulbar and pendulous urethra, derived from the urethral plate on the ventral aspect of the genital tubercle and lined with transitional epithelium proximal, changing to simple squamous epithelium distally. The most distal pendulous urethra is also known as the fossa navicularis, also derived from the urethral plate as it traverses the glans penis but is composed of stratified squamous epithelium.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe ratio of the incidence of AUV to that of posterior urethral valves (PUV) is 1:8; PUV occurs in 1 in 8000 to 1 in 25,000 live male births. Diverticula of the anterior urethra are uncommon but are the second most common form of congenital urethral obstruction, after PUV, in infants and children. Fewer than 50 cases of megalourethra had been reported in the literature by 1993, the scaphoid type being more common. Both Cowper’s duct cysts and congenital urethral polyps are quite rare.\n\nAnterior Urethral Valves\n\nAnterior urethral valves are the most common congenital obstructive lesion of the anterior urethra but are 25-30 times less common than PUVs. As classically described, these take the form of either a fenestrated diaphragmatic membrane or a mucosal cusp arising from the ventral wall of the urethra. The embryology is unclear because anterior urethral valves are occasionally found at the distal end of a diverticulum. However, hypoplastic corpus spongiosum over the affected portion of the anterior urethra indicates a place on the hypospadias spectrum or a faulty union between urethral mucosa and the epithelium of the fossa navicularis. A rupture of dilated bulbourethral glands has also been suggested as an aetiology. These valves may be located anywhere in the anterior urethra. In 40%, it is sited at the bulbar urethra, 30% at the penoscrotal junction and 30% in the penile urethra. They have rarely been reported in the fossa navicularis. The presentation is usually with obstructive symptoms. These patients commonly have urine dribbling, difficulty voiding, incontinence, hesitancy or urinary retention, poor urinary stream, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Older children may also have enuresis, postvoid dribbling, or failure to thrive. Secondary changes in the upper urinary tract are rare. However, the obstruction may result in megacystis, bladder rupture, severe hydroureteronephrosis, acute kidney injury, or urinary ascites in the neonatal period. Micturating cystourethrography (MCUG), retrograde urethrography, and endoscopy are useful diagnostic tools. On MCUG, the valve itself may be visualised as a linear defect along the ventral wall but may only be noted as an abrupt change in the caliber of the urethra.\n\nVesicoureteral reflux has been noted in approximately one-third of patients, and upper tract dilation was noted in half. Endoscopically, the valve appears as a filmy, ventrally located cusp or flap of tissue, and it occasionally has been described as an iris-like membrane. One must scrutinise the urethra at the distal end of any urethral diverticulum because the retrograde flow of the irrigant may flatten the valve mechanism against the urethral wall. Suprapubic pressure with the bladder full and irrigation ports on the scope open may demonstrate the valve mechanism more readily.\n\nFurthermore, the elevation or engaging the valve with an endoscopic loop is invaluable in identifying the lesion. Transurethral incision of the valve is adequate for most patients, but one must be careful to incise completely to avoid any distal obstructing lip. Endoscopic treatment does leave the patient with a urethral diverticulum in most cases. An occasional patient with a large diverticulum and a defect in the spongiosum may benefit from open repair, which allows reconstruction of the valve, diverticulum, and investing tissues. A vesicostomy may be required in a premature or small infant to facilitate relief of obstruction until the infant can accommodate a cystoscope or undergo further reconstruction. Up to 80% of children with anterior urethral valves will develop bladder dysfunction, instability, hyperreflexia, and diminished compliance and capacity noted on urodynamics. Because of the milder and more subtle presentation, the overall incidence of preserved renal function in AUV is better than PUVs, with around 78% of patients having normal renal function after treatment.\n\nUrethral Diverticulum\n\nIn the more common wide-mouthed form, usually located in the region of the penoscrotal junction, the distal lip may give rise to a form of valvular obstruction as the diverticulum undergoes progressive distension. Presentation is either with obstructive symptoms or with post-micturition dribbling. The rarer saccular lesions have a narrow neck and may occur anywhere along the length of the penile urethra, including the fossa navicularis. Presentation is with urinary infection; rarely associated with stone formation within the diverticulum. Treatment is by endoscopic incision or resection of the obstructing lip or, rarely, by an open perineal approach to excising a large diverticulum.\n\nMegalourethra\n\nIt is a rare congenital anomaly characterised by abnormal dilatation of the penile urethra without clear obstruction. It may be associated with a lack of corpus spongiosum or the complete absence of the corpora cavernosa. In such cases, the penis amounts to little more than a floppy sac comprised of skin externally and urethral mucosa internally. It shares some of the characteristics of a urethral diverticulum but includes more extensive and uniform involvement of the urethra. The classification of fusiform and scaphoid types reflects the severity of the defect and the resultant effect on the corpus spongiosum and cavernosum. The scaphoid form results from deficiency or absence of the ventral corpora spongiosum. A fusiform megalourethra also affects the dorsal spongiosum and corpora cavernosa. Adamson and Burge have described a third type with all corpora intact. The cause of megalourethra remains somewhat controversial. Stephens postulated that a delay in the canalisation of the distal epithelial core might lead to obstruction and proximal dilation. Others have suggested that embryological arrest of the mesoderm investing the urethral folds influences the corpora and erectile tissue development.\n\n\nFigure 1 Examination under anesthesia showing large megalourethra involving the penile shaft.\n\nMegalourethra is often associated with other urorectal anomalies such as imperforate anus, prune-belly syndrome, and urethral valves and with varying degrees of obstructive uropathy. Diagnosis is often suspected on physical examination, mainly if the child is seen to void. The urethral meatus may be normally placed but pathological. A soft, elongated phallus often characterises the rare and more severe fusiform type with palpably inadequate corpora. Ventral ballooning with voiding is typical of scaphoid megalourethra. Voiding cystourethrography and renal ultrasonography are performed to establish the diagnosis and evaluate the upper tracts. Treatment centers on reconstructing the urethra and corpus spongiosum using standard principles of hypospadias repair. The scaphoid urethra can be opened longitudinally and tabularised using the better dorsal and lateral tissue. The fusiform variety presents a much more difficult challenge depending on the amount of corporal tissue present. Some may be impossible to completely repair from a functional standpoint and benefit from corporal reconstruction with penile prostheses as adults.\n\nSyringocoele\n\nSyringocoele (from \"syrongos\", meaning tube and \"coele\", meaning swelling) is a rare cystic dilatation of the distal portion of Cowper’s gland ducts. The gland was named after the surgeon and anatomist William Cowper, who first described it in the 17th century. Cowper's glands are homologous to the Bartholin's glands in females. These exocrine glands are paired bulbourethral glands lying on either of the membranous urethrae. The main glands lie on the urogenital diaphragm, and the accessory glands lie deeply within the spongy bulbar urethra. The ducts of these glands pass through the external sphincter and enter the bulbous urethra, opening separately or as a single united duct one to two centimetres (cm) more distally. The glands produce mucoid secretion during sexual arousal and forms part of the pre-ejaculate that helps to lubricate the urethra for the passage of spermatozoa.\n\n\nFigure 2 Unruptured syringocele appearance in MCUG\n\n\nFigure 3 Ruptured syringocele appearance in MCUG\n\nThe true incidence of syringocoele is unknown and could be due to the rarity and unfamiliarity with this condition compounded by the existence of alternate diagnoses such as a false passage, urethral diverticulum, or anterior urethral valve, and in some, the potential for spontaneous resolution. Obstructions of the ductal orifice are either congenital or acquired. The proliferation of the ductal epithelium results in congenital retention cysts and pre-stenotic ductal dilatation.\n\nInfection or repeated urethral catheterisation are causes for acquired obstruction. Syringocoele is rare and may present with recurrent urinary infections, hematuria, obstructive symptoms, or post-void dribbling. Rarely it can be an incidental finding. Significant bladder outflow obstruction due to a syringocoele in early life can lead to chronic kidney disease and bladder dysfunction. For all patients, therefore, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are vital. A helpful classification considers the aspects of clinical presentation and patient management. The groups are obstructive, non-obstructive symptomatic and non-obstructive asymptomatic. The obstructive group would include all patients presenting with either signs or symptoms or radiographic or endoscopic evidence of bladder outflow obstruction. Presentation is usually in early infancy.\n\nAssociated abnormalities include thick wall bladder, multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), dysplastic kidney and pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction. Micturating cystogram (MCUG) is a diagnostic test that can show a \"filling defect\" appearance of the urethra (unruptured syringocoele) or contrast filling the ruptured cyst with bladder trabeculation, VUR and incomplete emptying. A cystoscopic examination can be confirmatory. Endoscopic management uses various techniques to treat syringocoeles, namely Bugbee electrode, scissors, hooked urethral catheter, catheterisation, and Holmium: YAG Laser. During endoscopic management, unruptured syringocoeles are laid open, and the lips of all the ruptured syringocoeles can be incised. Syringocoele is not an inconsequential condition in infants, and all patients must be treated appropriately and followed up closely. In pediatric urology practice, syringocoele must be considered in evaluating anterior urethral obstruction. Close follow up of patients with syringocoele is necessary as up to 40% have renal impairment, of whom nearly two-fifths progress to chronic renal failure. A minority have bladder dysfunction.\n\nUrethral Atresia and Agenesis\n\nUrethral atresia and agenesis must be included in the differential diagnosis of renal anomalies and bilateral hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero. Unfortunately, these lesions are not compatible with renal development unless there is some other egress for the urine to escape the bladder, such as a patent urachus or an urorectal communication. Management will depend on the specific anomaly and the amount of renal function salvaged by alternative urinary drainage. An association between urethral atresia and prune-belly syndrome in females has been recognised, but few reports discuss the outcome of treatment in these gravely ill infants. Most of these children will come to renal transplants due to severe renal damage in the neonatal period. In males, progressive catheter dilation has been used reasonably and would be similarly effective in females (PADUA-progressive augmentation by dilating the urethra anterior). It is still unclear if this would offer a long-term solution.\n\nUrethral Duplications\n\nIt is a rare set of urethral anomalies. Considering the many different anatomic variants, no common embryological pathway can explain all the variants of urethral duplication. Johnson suggested that faulty fusion of the genital ridge and urethral fold could result in two separate channels, and Lowsley proposed persistence of the urogenital plate during infoldings of the genital ridge as an explanation. Urethral duplication can occur with complete duplication of the phallus or urinary bladder as a more severe abnormality. There are two types of duplication, either sagittal or collateral. Most duplications occur in the sagittal plane with a single phallus. When one is found above the other in this setting, the dominant urethra exits in a hypospadiac position and the accessory urethra in the orthotopic position. Many of the nondominant dorsal urethras end blindly short of the bladder. If, however, they do reach the bladder, the child is often incontinent from the accessory channel. In the collateral form, the duplicate urethras run side by side. Complete duplication of the bladder and urethra is rare and particularly in females.\n\n\nFigure 4 Cystogram study showing Y-Urethral Duplication with an arrows pointing to (dorsal) non dominant urethra.\n\nIn some cases, both urethras leave the bladder separately and remain separate throughout their length, whereas in other cases, the duplicate urethras unite distally to form a single channel. In the so-called 'spindle' variety, the urethra separates into two components before reuniting again more distally, whereas, in 'Y' duplications, an accessory urethra diverges from the main channel to emerge in the perianal region or the perineum. A widened symphysis pubis may be found in those cases associated with an epispadiac meatus, suggesting a relationship to the exstrophy–epispadias complex. Surgical reconstruction is dependent upon individual anatomy but nearly always entails excision of the narrower accessory urethra. Endoscopy at the time of reconstruction may occasionally be necessary to understand the lesion thoroughly. If the problem is noted because of minor splitting of the urinary stream during voiding, repair may not be necessary. Such consideration is typically only appropriate for those patients with both meatuses immediately adjacent to each other, and even those patients may benefit from a simple meatoplasty to combine both openings as one. The complexity of the repair increases as the two openings diverge, especially if the dominant ventral meatus is very proximal. In that situation, the ventral perineal urethra usually must be mobilised away from the rectum to a more orthotopic position, and the remainder of the urethra reconstructed with a variety of urethroplasty techniques. A complete prepuce is useful when present. Patients should not undergo neonatal circumcision if the anomaly is noted. Mucosal grafts may be necessary for some patients having undergone prior circumcision or surgery. They also may be necessary for some patients whose preputial skin is not adequate in length.\n\nWith the aggressive dissection needed to reconstruct the ventral urethra, exposure for excision of the accessory, dorsal urethra is usually good. That structure may also be anastomosed to the ventral urethra proximally. Passerine-Glazel and colleagues have described gradual serial dilation of the dorsal urethra to render it useful for voiding. We prefer mobilisation and reconstruction of the dominant urethra in most cases.\n\nMeatal Stenosis\n\nMeatal stenosis arises most frequently in circumcised boys and is caused by diaper dermatitis. The presenting symptom is usually a decreased or deflected stream. Meatotomy and meatoplasty are reliable methods of management.\n\nAnterior Urethral Stricture\n\nStrictures of the anterior urethra are often idiopathic (perhaps congenital) or traumatic in origin. However, strictures of post-hypospadias repair also occur with some frequency in the anterior urethra; as a result, either of the repair itself or the catheter used as a urethral stent. Strictures of the anterior urethra usually produce symptoms of irritation (hematuria, dysuria, wetting) or obstruction (straining to void, retention). They are best diagnosed with radiographic imaging of the urethra or endoscopy. Uroflowmetry may reveal an obstructive flow pattern, but the flow rate may be normal despite the presence of a stricture; therefore, uroflowmetry cannot be relied upon to rule out a stricture. Direct vision internal urethrotomy is adequate in only half of the cases but is probably not harmful if used only once. Dilation does not seem to be an appropriate treatment, as it needs repeat sessions many times over. End-to-end urethral anastomosis after excision of the stricture is the most effective treatment when it is anatomically feasible, even for post-hypospadias strictures. When urethral anastomosis is not feasible, a patch graft of buccal mucosa or skin is usually successful. PDS is best avoided as a suture material in urethral repair.\n\nUrethral Polyps\n\nUrethral polyps are another unusual anomaly of the male urethra. They may be congenital but have also been reported in adults, suggesting that they can be acquired or slowly grow until large enough to cause symptoms. These fibro-endothelial lesions commonly arise from the verumontanum and are typically covered with transitional epithelium over a fibromuscular core. Small polyps are usually discovered incidentally during endoscopy for some unrelated purpose. In contrast, the more extensive lesions, with a polypoid head floating freely on an extended stalk, tend to obtrude through the bladder neck to give rise to acute, transient episodes of urinary retention. Other symptoms are straining to void, urgency and hematuria. Frank urethral bleeding may also occur. Diagnosis is by MCU or cystourethroscopy. Voiding cystourethrography often shows a filling defect in the urethra that may vary in location. Diagnostic confirmation is made by cystoscopy. Most polyps can be excised endoscopically (transurethral excision), although, for large polyps, an open transvesical approach may be required.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Anterior urethral valves are the most common congenital obstructive lesion of the anterior urethra and usually present with obstructive symptoms. Transurethral incision of the valve is adequate for most patients.\n  Urethral diverticulum can present either as the more common wide-mouthed form, or saccular form. Treatment is by endoscopic incision or resection of the obstructing lip or, rarely, by an open perineal approach excising a large diverticulum.\n  Megalourethra It is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by abnormal dilatation of the penile urethra without a structural obstruction. Voiding cystourethrography and renal ultrasonography are performed to establish the diagnosis and evaluate the upper tracts. Treatment centers on reconstructing the urethra and corpus spongiosum using standard principles of hypospadias repair.\n  Syringocoele is a rare cystic dilatation of the distal portion of Cowper’s gland ducts. For all patients, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are vital. Endoscopic management uses various techniques to treat syringocoeles, namely Bugbee electrode, scissors, hooked urethral catheter, catheterization, and Holmium: YAG Laser.\n  Urethral atresia and agenesis must be included in the differential diagnosis of renal anomalies and bilateral hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero. Management will depend on the specific anomaly and the amount of renal function salvaged by alternative urinary drainage. In males, progressive catheter dilation has been used reasonably and would be similarly effective in females (PADUA-progressive augmentation by dilating the urethra anterior).\n  Urethral duplication is a rare spectrum of urethral anomalies. The complexity of the repair increases as the two openings diverge, especially if the dominant ventral meatus is very proximal.\n  Meatal stenosis arises most frequently in circumcised boys and is caused by diaper dermatitis. Meatotomy and meatoplasty are reliable methods of management.\n  Anterior urethral strictures of the anterior urethra are often idiopathic (perhaps congenital) or traumatic in origin. End-to-end urethral anastomosis after excision of the stricture is the most effective treatment when it is anatomically feasible, even for post-hypospadias strictures.\n  Urethral polyps are an unusual anomaly of the male urethra. These fibro-endothelial lesions commonly arise from the verumontanum. Diagnosis is by MCU or cystourethroscopy. Most polyps can be excised endoscopically (transurethral excision), although, for large polyps, an open transvesical approach may be required.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAntón-Juanilla M, Lozano-Ortega JL, Galbarriatu-Gutiérrez A.

        "title": "Congenital and Traumatic Urethral Stricture",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nUrethral strictures were initially thought to be uncommon in children.1 Later reports suggested that they are not so rare.2 The impression of low incidence was mainly due to under-reporting and sparse literature. Johanson was the first to observe the stricture formation in 1953 after complete urethral disruption.1 Urethral strictures are broadly classified based on their etiology into congenital/idiopathic, iatrogenic, inflammatory, and traumatic. It is unclear whether strictures with no definite cause should be classified into congenital or idiopathic.\n\nHarshman et al and Kaplan &amp; Brock recommended to avoid the designation of congenital urethral stricture and described such lesions as strictures of unknown etiology.3,4 It is unclear whether catheter-induced strictures can be classified as iatrogenic or inflammatory. Since such a stricture would not have occurred without an indwelling catheter in the first place, one may argue that it should be classified as iatrogenic.2 Iatrogenic causes like catheterization or post hypospadias repair stricture account for the majority of anterior urethral stricture disease in the pediatric population, especially the younger age-group. However, as the child grows, there is a gradual preponderance of traumatic urethral strictures, including posterior urethral strictures.\n\nCongenital and Idiopathic Strictures\n\nMori et al reported that congenital urethral stenosis/stricture was an important cause of recurrent urinary tract infections, enuresis, frequency or hematuria in in boys.5 It is recognized as a typical straight line filling (Figure 1) Also referred to as Cobb’s collar or Moorman’s ring or congenital obstructing posterior urethral membrane (COPUM), their etiology is obscure. It is debated whether this entity could be referred to as a stricture.\n\n\nFigure 1 VCUG showing idiopathic/ congenital urethral stricture/ stenosis. Ring like narrowing is seen at the junction of anterior and posterior urethra. Often the upper tracts are not dilated and they present with UTI or dribbling\n\nThis lesion is noticed as a ring-form of stenosis on cystoscopy (Figure 2) just distal to the external urethral sphincter.6 Typically the features like bladder irregularity, thickening or upper tract changes seen in posterior urethral valves (PUV) are absent. The most effective treatment of this lesion is optic internal urethrotomy (OIU) under direct vision. This is performed at 12 O’ clock position using a cold knife (arrow of (Figure 2) In boys with daytime wetting and a congenital bulbar urethral stenosis, wetting episodes improved in 69.4% after OIU.5 Furthermore, urinary tract infections and vesicoureteral reflux reduced by prompt treatment of this pathology.\n\n\nFigure 2 Optical internal urethrotomy (OIU) for idiopathic/ congenital narrowing involves cold knife division at 12 O’clock position\n\nIatrogenic Strictures\n\nCatheter Induced Strictures\n\nUrethral catheterization is an important iatrogenic cause (12.3% overall), and is the main cause of multifocal and pan anterior urethral stricture in a study by Ansari et al.2 Iatrogenic strictures due to prolonged catheterisation (often inserted for output monitoring in neuro ICUs) are often located at bulbo membranous region. While some of them may be due to oversized catheters, some may be due to inflation of bulb in urethra or traumatic catheter removal (often urethral bleeding is noted in such a situation). Prolonged catheterisation itself causes urethral inflammation, ischemia and ultimately urethral stricture. Often they present with retention following catheter removal. In such a situation the author prefers to perform a supra pubic catheter (SPC) insertion under ultrasound guidance. This helps in future trial voiding by clamping the SPC. Also the SPC may be used for a voiding cysto urethrogram (VCUG) to assess the extent of stricture. Often these strictures are short segment narrowing amenable to OIU under general anaesthesia. Following OIU, a repeat VCUG and trial voiding are needed to ensure resolution of stricture. Clear and well defined indications for catheterization, skilled urethral catheter insertion, and consideration of SPC when prolonged catheterization is likely should decrease the incidence of these iatrogenic strictures.\n\nStrictures Following Posterior Urethral Valve\n\nTransurethral valve fulguration is another important cause of pediatric stricture urethra. Although specific data on contribution of valve fulguration to pediatric strictures are lacking, the incidence ranges from 0% to 25% in various series.7 In a latest series, 11 of 62 patients (5.6% of overall) had an iatrogenic stricture after valve fulguration.2 While various causes have been proposed in the development of these strictures, the most important is traumatic insertion of an oversized resectoscope in a narrow urethral lumen and monopolar current leakage due to insufficient insulation of the resectoscope or overzealous buzzing. It is felt that this is an avoidable cause of strictures in kids, which can be prevented by gentleness in surgical technique, using appropriate-sized small instruments for fulguration in a narrow infant urethra, decreasing the contact time during fulguration to avoid deep cuts and fulguration under direct vision only at the area of valves.8 The authors prefer to use cold knife ablation over diathermy fulgration for PUV ablation to prevent thermal injury and reduce stricture formation.9 Often strictures following valve ablation are narrow segment strictures amenable to OIU. This has to be performed carefully with an upfront guide wire insertion.\n\nHypospadias Strictures\n\nStrictures following hypospadias repair account for a good proportion of anterior urethral strictures in adolescents and young adults. They may present early with poor stream and dribbling or late with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) and upper tract changes. Their presentation is highly variable, and they may be diagnosed late, especially in the early adulthood after a supposedly ‘successful’ repair in childhood with no fistulas. Ansari emphasized the need to warn parents that children undergoing hypospadias repair could develop strictures in the future and should be monitored during adolescence for stricture formation.2 Often the uroflow shows a flat trace with a large post void residual urine. Hypospadias strictures following distal urethral repair (tubularised incised plate- TIP) are often long segment stenosis due to poor urethral lumen. These present early with straining and dribbling. They often need to be laid open until normal calibre urethra is reached. They may need local prepucial skin graft/ oral mucosa graft (OMG) or buccal mucosa graft (BMG) as an inlay while being laid open. After a period of 6 months, these can be tubularised to provide a wider calibre urethra. Hypospadias stricture following proximal urethra repair (after a single stage tubularised repair – Duckett) often are due to narrowing at the junction of native urethra and skin lined neourethra. An ascending urethrogram (AUG) is needed to demonstrate the exact location and extent of narrowing (Figure 3) If a narrow ring stricture is found at the junction of neo urethra with native urethra, an OIU alone may suffice. On the other hand a dense long segment stricture may need OMG/BMG staged repair.10 (Figure 4) depicts a flow chart in the management of hypospadias anterior urethral strictures (HAUS). The entire narrow scarred segment is excised and OMG is quilted in place. Following a period of 6 months to 1 year, tubularisation is performed. Barbagli reported that stricture length, but not the number of previous operations needed for primary hypospadias repair, was associated with the risk of failure.11 Some surgeons favour a single stage dorsal OMG inlay repair for these situations while the author favours a two staged approach.12,13\n\n\nFigure 3 Anterior urethral stricture following hypospadias repair often noticed at the junction of native urethra and neo urethra. Multiple fold like narrowing are amenable to OIU while long anterior urethral strictures need oral mucosa grafting with two stage repair.\n\n\nFigure 4 A flow chart in the management of hypospadias anterior urethral strictures (HAUS).\n\nInflammatory Strictures\n\nUnlike adult series, strictures due to lichen sclerosis (LS) or infectious causes are rare in children.14 Although LS is often thought to be a disease of adulthood, balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) akin to LS is an important cause of urethral strictures especially in older children. Recent reports show they are not so uncommon as thought before.15 These strictures are more difficult to treat and need multiple interventions as they are a chronic inflammatory process and have a tendency to recur.2 Pediatric urologists operating these strictures should explain to the caregivers about the condition and the need for prolonged follow-up to identify recurrences.\n\nBuccal and Oral Mucosa Graft Substitution Urethroplasty\n\nAnterior urethral strictures not amenable to end-to-end anastomosis, require substitution urethroplasty. This can be achieved by using penile skin flaps or free grafts of full-thickness skin, bladder oral mucosa (OMG) or buccal mucosa (BMG). OMG/ BMG substitution urethroplasty is fast emerging as the most preferable technique for pan urethral strictures involving distal urethra.16 In those with pendulous urethral strictures a circum-coronal incision is used, while for more proximal strictures a midline perineal incision is used. The spongiosum is then detached dorsally from the corpora and a urethrotomy is made at 12 o'clock position. In patients with inflammatory or traumatic strictures this approach is easier while in those with hypospadias stricture spongiosum is typically scarred/ absent making only ventray lay opening at 6 o’clock position feasible. In such cases a two-stage procedure involves complete excision of the fibrotic tissue and BMG quilting in the first stage. The urethra is reconstructed in the second stage, 4–6 months after the first.\n\nIn a single stage dorsal onlay repair, for inflammatory or traumatic strictures, BMG/OMG is quilted to the corpora with interrupted 6–0 polyglactin sutures, and subsequently sutured to the cut edges of the urethra with continuous sutures. Barbagli et al have described the detailed operative steps (Figure 5)17 For meatal reconstruction, the distal most BMG is fixed with interrupted 5–0 polyglactin sutures to the dorsally cut margins of the meatus. The patient is discharged 3–5 days after surgery with an indwelling urethral and a suprapubic catheter. Catheters are removed 3 weeks later, after a voiding cystourethrography. While some authors favour the dorsal onlay technique others have reported excellent long-term outcomes with ventral onlay techniques,5,18,19\n\n\nFigure 5 BMG dorsal onlay substitution urethroplasty; urethra has been mobilised; opened at 12 0’clock position dorsally; BMG quilted dorsally and being anastomosed to edges.\n\nTraumatic Strictures\n\nTraumatic etiology becomes a major contributor to stricture disease as the age advances. In a series by Ansari, 36.9% of the overall strictures were due to traumatic etiology.2 While 18% of strictures in children younger than 10 years were secondary to trauma, 45% of the strictures in patients older than 10 years were traumatic in origin. Pelvic fracture an important cause of stricture urethra in adolescents is usually after a fall from height or road traffic accidents or perineal trauma due to straddle injury.\n\nTurner Warwick introduced the term “complex” pelvic fracture posterior urethral distraction defect (PFPUDD) when one or more of the following features are present: (a) the length of the distraction defect is long (≥3 cm) surrounded by extensive pelvic fibrosis and (b) are accompanied by para-urethral diverticulae, false passages, or simultaneous bladder neck lesion.20 Most of the complex urethral distraction defects require a wider surgical exposure to restore urethral continuity.21\n\nAlthough pathogenesis of PFPUDD in children tends to follow a similar pattern to the one in adults, several key elements require consideration. Location of traumatic urethral injury in children is often unpredictable due to the abdominal position of the bladder and immaturity of the prostate.22 Some other factors to be considered in children are: (a) urethral distraction defects tend to be longer than in adults because of marked upwards displacement of the bladder and prostate, (b) double injuries at the bladder neck and the membranous urethra are more frequently observed in children and (c) pre-pubertal size of the perineum may make it difficult to reach a high lying proximal urethral end.23\n\nColapinto and McCallum24 classified traumatic posterior urethral injuries into three categories based on the radiological appearance. In type 1 the prostate or urogenital diaphragm is dislocated but the membranous urethra is merely stretched and not severed. In type 2 the membranous urethra is ruptured above the urogenital diaphragm at the apex of the prostate. In type 3 the membranous urethra is ruptured above and below the urogenital diaphragm Recently, a new classification of posterior urethral injury in patients with fractured pelvis was proposed.25 The new classification scheme allows us to compare different therapeutic strategies and their outcomes (Table 1)\n\nTable 1 Unified anatomical and mechanical classification of traumatic urethral strictures.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Class\n      Definition\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      I\n      The posterior urethra stretched but intact\n    \n    \n      II\n      Tear of the prostatomembranous urethra above the urogenital diaphragm\n    \n    \n      III\n      Partial or complete tear of both anterior urethra and posterior urethra with disruption of the urogenital diaphraqm\n    \n    \n      IV\n      Bladder injury extending into the urethra\n    \n    \n      IVa\n      Injury of the bladder base with periurethral extravasation simulating posterior urethral injury\n    \n    \n      V\n      Partial or complete pure anterior urethral injury\n    \n  \n\n\nDebate is still present among pediatric urologists on the superior approach: early urethral realignment with or without primary reconstruction of the transected urethra vs. primary SPC and deferred repair of the urethra. Nerli et al.26 reported that half of the children undergoing primary realignment needed additional endoscopic urethrotomies, while some required urethroplasty to manage a resultant stricture. The author favours primary SPC to tide over the acute phase of retention following trauma. We also prefer to avoid urethral instrumentation which may further urethral damage or a risky pelvic exploration that can disturb a hematoma and prevent a proper approximation. After a period of 6-8 months when orthopaedic stabilisation is removed, an opposing urethrogram is performed to assess the location and length of the stricture (Figure 6) Several surgical procedures have been proposed for the delayed repair of PFPUDDs. These include urethral dilatation, endoscopic techniques like OIU, substitution procedures and deferred tension-free anastomotic repair.\n\n\nFigure 6 Opposing urethrogram is an essential step in assessing the extent of post traumatic urethral distraction defects. It is typically performed by injecting contrast from SPC to fill posterior urethra while injecting via meatus to fill anterior urethra.\n\nOIU can be advantageous for both the management of annular membranous strictures following partial urethral injuries or for short non-obliterative strictures after failed post-traumatic primary anastomotic repair.27 The current understanding is urethral dilatation and OIU for PFPUDD are not acceptable in children; as the reported results have been poor, and patients undergoing these procedures often need additional surgical operations.23,28\n\nAnastomotic Urethroplasty\n\nAnastomotic urethroplasty is currently favoured approach for restoration of urethral continuity in children and adults with PFPUDDs. Success of anastomotic urethroplasty is often dependent on adequate surgical exposure, excision of all fibrous tissue occupying the distraction defect, mobilization of the normal bulbar urethra, fixation of healthy mucosa at the edges of the bulbar and prostatic urethral ends and performing a tension-free spatulated anastomosis (Figure 7), (Figure 8), when appropriate blood supply is present through the urethra. Anastomotic repair can be attempted by many approaches: (a) perineal approach, (b) elaborated 1-stage perineal access, (c) transpubic (partial or total) approach, (d) progressive perineal-abdominal (transpubic) approach, and (e) posterior sagittal access.\n\n\nFigure 7 Proper mobilisation of bulbar urethra and wide anastomosis after spatulation are crucial steps\n\n\nFigure 8 Mobilisation of crura and chipping away of inferior pubic ramus help in shorter route and better alignment\n\nPerineo-abdominal (transpubic) approach enables progression from a perineal to a perineal-abdominal access with or without partial pubectomy, according to the intra operative anatomical features of the urethral distraction defect and allows supracrural re-routing of the mobilized urethra if needed. The elaborated 1-stage perineal access provides stepwise maneuvers to accomplish a tension-free anastomosis: (a) adequate mobilization of the bulbar urethra, (b) separation of the proximal corporeal bodies, (c) resection of the inferior margin of the pubic arch, and (d) the possibility to reroute the anterior urethra around one corporeal body to shorten the course of the mobilized urethra\n\nAn overall success rate of 75-85% is reported for anastomotic urethroplasty.29 Failed perineal urethroplasty was attributed to improper patient selection - a distraction defects of at least 3 cm of length with significant cephalic displacement of the prostate. In children with PFPUDD, surgical repair should begin through a perineum exposure and when tension–free anastomosis is not possible an abdominal (partial pubectomy) approach is required for the correction of the distraction defect.21\n\nConclusions\n\nIatrogenic causes (catheterization, PUV, hypospadias repair) account for the majority of anterior urethral strictures in the younger age-group; while as the child grows, traumatic and posterior urethral strictures take preponderance. Initial treatment of traumatic posterior urethral injuries associated with pelvic fractures should aim at stabilizing the patient, SPC and treating the life-threatening associated injuries. Preoperative evaluation of the established urethral distraction defect includes opposing urethrogram and cystoscopy to define the anatomical extent of the urethral distraction defect. When a healthy anterior urethra is present anastomotic urethroplasty is ideal to treat PFPUDDs. BMG/OMG inlay substitution urethroplasty are mainly indicated for pan urethral strictures.\n\nReferences\n\n\nHerle K, Jehangir S, Thomas RJ. Stricture Urethra in Children: An Indian Perspective.

        "title": "Prune Belly Syndrome",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nPrune belly syndrome (PBS) otherwise referred to as Eagle-Barrett syndrome, is a rare multisystem condition typically characterized by constellation of anomalies with variable degrees of severity, with the major findings being deficiency of the abdominal musculature, bilateral intra-abdominal testes and anomalous urinary tract.1,2Additional associated non-genitourinary anomalies involve the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, cardiac system and musculoskeletal system.3 Disease severity exists along a broad continuum with some children not surviving the new-born period and others being minimally affected.4\n\nEmbryology\n\nSeveral predominant theories have been proposed regarding the embryogenesis of PBS though none of them has universal acceptance, and there is some overlap between them. The four main theories are 1, an early in utero posterior urethral obstruction (probably a hypoplastic/dysplastic prostate or abnormal urethra), resulting in proximal bladder, ureteral and renal dilation with associated poor abdominal wall development 2, a primary defect in the lateral plate mesoderm, which is the precursor of the ureters, bladder, prostate, urethra, and gubernaculum 3, an intrinsic defect of the urinary tract leading to ureteral dilation and fetal ascites and 4, a yolk sac defect.5,6\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe incidence of PBS has been reported to be 1 in 29,000 to 1 in 40,000 live births, similar to that of bladder exstrophy with 95% of affected patients being males.1,2,7 Females represent less than 5% of all PBS cases, and they present with abdominal wall deficiency and a dilated, dysmorphic urinary tract without any associated gonadal anomaly.8 A higher incidence is noted in twins, blacks, and children born to younger mothers.9 Although PBS often presents as a sporadic event, a genetic contribution is also suspected with mutations in genes encoding smooth muscle transcription factors, contractile filaments and neural enzymes/receptors.10,11\n\nClinical Features and Pathogenesis\n\nGenitourinary Anomalies\n\nKidneys\n\nThe spectrum of renal abnormalities in PBS patients extends from normal renal parenchyma to dysplasia. Around half the cases have renal dysplasia which is usually of the Potter type II and IV varieties and this can vary between both sides also.1,2 While the type II variety with few nephrons and parenchymal disorganization is more indicative of a renal mesenchymal defect, whereas the type IV variety with cortical and tubular cysts is associated with outlet obstruction, where there has been no urachal decompression.12 Though the renal collecting system is characteristically dilated, often to a severe degree, the degree of dilation, however, does not correlate with the degree of renal dysplasia and calyceal morphology may be well preserved, even in the presence of massive dilatation. Though, hydronephrosis is usually non obstructive, primary or secondary ureteropelvic junction obstruction can also occur. However, it is important to note that renal infection rather than obstruction that poses the greatest risk to renal function in these patients.1,2\n\nUreters\n\nThe ureters are typically dilated, tortuous and redundant. Though the massive dilation and stenosis can occur at all levels, the proximal (upper) portions of the ureters are usually less abnormal than the distal segments. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is present in 75% of children with PBS.12 Obstruction is not common but has been reported at the ureteropelvic and ureterovesical junctions. Histologic sectioning demonstrates lack of smooth muscle cells and increase in ratio of collagen to smooth muscle in the more affected distal segments especially the refluxing ones , with more normal-appearing smooth muscle cells in the proximal segments.13 This fact is critical when ureteral reconstruction is undertaken. The decreased number of thick and thin myofibrils noted on ultrastructural examination is thought to contribute to the ineffective peristalsis because of poor ureteral wall coaptation resulting in upper tract stasis, which may lead to infection. Also, in many patients the severity of the urinary tract abnormalities is not proportional to the degree of flaccidity of the abdominal wall.14\n\nBladder\n\nThe bladder usually appears massively enlarged with a pseudodiverticulum at the urachus and a patent urachus in 25% to 30% of patients.12 Unlike the picture seen in obstructed bladders due to other reasons , despite being very thick, the bladder contour is smooth. On voiding, the bladder neck opens widely into a dilated prostatic urethra.1,2 Histologically, in the absence of obstruction, the bladder has an increased ratio of collagen to muscle fibers, however smooth muscle hypertrophy can be seen when there is obstruction. On cystoscopy , the trigone is splayed with the ureteral orifices displaced superiorly and laterally , possibly contributing to the high incidence of vesicoureteral reflux. Characteristic findings in a urodynamic assessment include a normal compliant bladder with delayed first sensation to void and a large capacity.15 The voiding efficiency of these bladders is variable, with some emptying to completion while others having a significant postvoid residual possibly due to a relative outlet obstruction and the detrusor muscles inability to generate sufficient pressure during voiding in these patients.16 The term “unbalanced” voiding is usually used to refer to the former situation where a relative outflow resistance prevents effective bladder emptying.1,2 Though 50% of prune-belly patients void spontaneously with normal voiding pressures, flow rates and low postvoid residuals, it has been observed that deterioration of balanced voiding can occur with growth, resulting in significant postvoid residuals, emphasizing the need for periodic assessment.16\n\nProstate and Accessory Sex Organs\n\nPosterior urethral dilatation is due to prostatic hypoplasia, probably related to abnormal mesenchymal-epithelial development.12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 Histological sections reveal few prostatic cellular elements, with a reduced epithelial and smooth muscle cells and increased connective tissue cells.19 About 20% of patients have been observed to have also obstructive lesions in the distal posterior urethra in the form of urethral atresia, valves, urethral stenosis, urethral membrane and urethral diverticulum. The lack of prostatic parenchymal tissue can lead to an angulation of the urethra during voiding, which was referred to as type IV valve by Stephens.12 Prostatic hypoplasia and the associated incompetent bladder neck is also thought to be a factor in the ejaculatory failure/ retrograde ejaculation in patients with PBS.1,2 The accessory sex organs like the vas deferens and seminal vesicles are often atretic, although either may be dilated or thickened. The epididymis may be poorly attached to the testis and there may also be lack of continuity between the efferent ductules and the rete testis.20\n\nAnterior Urethra\n\nAlthough the anterior urethra of the PBS child is usually normal, several anomalies of the urethral segment have been reported; the most common of which are urethral atresia or hypoplasia and megalourethra.21,22,23,24,25 It has been postulated that urethral atresia or hypoplasia occurs because the urethra is unused, rather than malformed. Urethral atresia is often lethal if it’s not associated with decompression in the form of a patent urachus or sometimes even spontaneous bladder rupture with fistula formation.22\n\nAn unique feature in PBS is the occurrence of megalourethra.26 Transient in utero obstruction of the junction between the glanular and penile urethra has been proposed to cause megalourethra. Two variations of megalourethra are seen in patients with PBS-namely the fusiform (Figure 1) and the scaphoid (Figure 2), (Figure 3) variety.24 The fusiform type is a deficiency of the corpus cavernosum, as well as the spongiosum probably resulting from a mesenchymal deficiency of the urethral folds and is clinically seen as dilatation of entire phallus during voiding. On the other hand, the scaphoid variety which probably arises from a mesenchymal deficiency of the urethral supportive tissues leading to deficiency of the spongiosum only with preservation of the glans and corpora cavernosa, is characterised by dilatation of ventral urethra during voiding.26\n\n\nFigure 1 Clinical photograph of a child with prune belly syndrome\n\n\nFigure 2 Fusiform megalourethra\n\n\nFigure 3 Scaphoid megalourethra\n\nTestes\n\nBilateral intra-abdominal testes lying over the iliac vessels and adjacent to the dilated ureters are considered one of the typical findings in PBS.1,2 Although mechanical forces such as a mechanical obstruction from megacystis and poor intra-abdominal pressure due to abdominal wall abnormalities have long been hypothesised as the etiology for this failure of testicular descent, the fact that some patients with the typical urinary tract and abdominal musculature anomalies may have descended testes raises some doubt about pure mechanical factors.1,2 Regarding whether testes in children with PBS are intrinsically different from those without PBS, Pak et al compared the histology of intraabdominal testes found no difference in germ cell counts, spermatogonia and Leydig cells between PBS testes and non-PBS intraabdominal fetal testes.27,28 However, Orvis et al noted decreased numbers of spermatogonia and Leydig cell hyperplasia in fetal PBS testes implying an intrinsic testicular abnormality.29 Regarding the risk of malignancy in these testes, although the risk may be relatively low due to the lack of germinal epithelium, early orchidopexy and long-term follow-up are necessary to reduce the risk of testicular malignancy and enhance detection.30,31\n\nAbdominal Wall Defect\n\nThe appearance of the abdominal wall is a characteristic feature in children with PBS. Most commonly the muscular deficiency is uneven and patchy, with the medial and inferior muscular segments typically most deficient and may be disproportional to the urinary tract abnormalities. The most severely affected areas may have skin, subcutaneous fat and a single fibrous layer on the peritoneum, with histological examination using electron microscopy demonstrating a nonspecific pattern of myofilament disarray, Z line disorganization and mitochondrial proliferation.32,33 In spite of these abdominal wall issues, good wound healing without a tendency toward infections or incisional hernias is noted in these children. The typical appearance at birth is that of wrinkled, redundant skin with an abdomen that bulges in the flanks. As the patients grow, some of them show improved abdominal tone and appearance with fewer wrinkles, whereas in others the abdomen takes on more of a pot-belly appearance.1,2 Gait is usually not affected, although it may be delayed, and the children tend to roll to their side and use their arms to sit from a supine position. The poor support of the lower chest wall can lead to flaring of the costal margin and the resulting compromised cough effectiveness make these children more vulnerable to respiratory illness.\n\nExtra-Genitourinary Abnormalities\n\nOf all children with PBS, 75% have non–urinary tract abnormalities.1,2,4 After the obvious abdominal wall defect, the most common issues are cardiac, pulmonary, and orthopaedic (Table 1)34,35,36,37,38,39,40 In addition to these organ specific morbidities, nearly 50% of children with PBS are born premature, which significantly contributes to comorbidities.\n\nTable 1 Common extra genitourinary anomalies seen in prune belly syndrome\n\n\n  \n    \n      System\n      Common defects\n      Remarks\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Cardiac Anomalies (10%)\n      Patent ductus arteriosus, atrial and ventricular septal defects, ventricular septal defect, and tetralogy of Fallot\n      Cardiac abnormalities at birth may take precedence over urologic issues.\n    \n    \n      Pulmonary Abnormalities (55%)\n      Pulmonary hypoplasia Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum can be seen with or without pulmonary hypoplasia\n      Pulmonary hypoplasia can result from severe oligohydramnios related to renal dysplasia or severe bladder outlet obstruction and may result in new-born demise. In nearly half of new-borns with PBS, intubation and mechanical ventilatory support will be required with its attendant morbidities. The lack of ability to generate significant intra-abdominal pressure and  associated musculoskeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis and rib cage abnormalities, most commonly pectus excavatum, may contribute to increased risk of pneumonia and lobar atelectasis in these children .\n    \n    \n      Gastrointestinal Abnormalities (30%)\n      Anomalies result from incomplete rotation of the midgut giving way to a wide mesentery, which results in increased bowel mobility with intestinal malrotation, volvulus, atresias, and stenosis. Splenic torsion related to abnormal mesenteric fixation has also been reported. Omphalocele, gastroschisis, situs inversus abdominis, VACTERL (vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities) and anorectal abnormalities have been reported.\n      With a limited ability to generate intra-abdominal pressure as a result of the abdominal muscular hypoplasia, constipation becomes a lifelong problem and may lead to acquired megacolon.\n    \n    \n      Orthopaedic Abnormalities (65%)\n      Dimpling of the lateral aspect of the knees is a common finding in oligohydramnios and is frequently seen  in patients with PBS along with other defects like talipes equinovarus (26%), hip dysplasia (5%), and congenital scoliosis (4%). Lower extremity hypoplasia, absence, or amputation.\n      In view of the fact that most of these musculoskeletal defects are unilateral, the most likely cause of these defects is the compressive effect of oligohydramnios. Another proposed mechanism for lower limb anomalies has been compression of the external iliac vessels by the distended bladder, thereby compromising the blood supply to the lower extremities  Also, some of these malformations such as renal osteodystrophy, dislocation of the hip, scoliosis and pectus excavatum or carinatum tend to manifest or worsen with growth.\n    \n  \n\n\nDiagnosis and Evaluation\n\nPrenatal\n\nThough the diagnosis of PBS on ultrasound has been reported as early as 11-12 weeks of pregnancy, the diagnostic accuracy varies from 30% to 85% as PBS presents prenatally with many sonogram findings comparable to that of lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO) due to other causes including posterior urethral valves, ureterocele and urethral atresia.40,41,42,43,44 Prenatal diagnosis of PBS should be considered whenever the following ultrasound anomalies are clearly identified: oligohydramnios, urinary abnormalities (dilatation of the urinary tract, megacystis, bilateral hydroureteronephrosis) and the absence of abdominal musculature. Early diagnosis not only improves survival by prompting the treating clinician to conduct the delivery in a tertiary center for prompt multidisciplinary management of the affected newborns, but also gives the option of voluntary termination, if desired to the expectant parents.43\n\nNewborn\n\nThe appearance of the abdominal wall is diagnostic in the new-born, regardless of whether the diagnosis was known prenatally. Children affected with PBS present an unique challenge and require prompt multidisciplinary care from a team, comprising a neonatologist, urologist, nephrologist as well as cardiologist and pediatric orthopedician when indicated. Given the wide range of disease severity, a multisystem evaluation to rule out significant cardiac, pulmonary, or other associated malformations must take place in the neonatal period. An immediate chest x-ray is necessary to exclude associated pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. As is the case with LUTO, the initial postnatal course is dictated by the severity of comorbidities such as pulmonary hypoplasia with worse outcomes in those with prematurity and severe pulmonary hypoplasia.45,46,47\n\nAntenatal oligohydramnios in these infants indicate impaired renal function. Initial creatinine measurements reflect maternal renal function and repetitive sampling is necessary. If after 48–72 hours the serum creatinine is greater than 1.0 in the term infant or 1.5 in the preterm infant, a degree of renal insufficiency is present. A progressive rise in serum creatinine over the first few weeks of life, portends a poor outcome. If initial nadir creatinine is less than 0.7 mg/dL, then subsequent renal failure is unlikely.48 Urine is sent for baseline culture and antibiotic prophylaxis is initiated. Measurement of serum and urinary electrolytes at birth can be helpful in assessing sodium conservation, implying adequate renal function.\n\nDiagnostic Evaluation\n\nA thorough urologic evaluation proceeds after stabilization of the patient due to other comorbidities. Physical examination and ultrasonography of the urinary tract are initially required.46 Renal sonograms provide information on cortical thickness, presence of cystic changes and renal size. Sonographic examinations before and after voiding give a clue to the presence of vesicoureteral reflux and post void residual urine.\n\nInitially, a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is performed in those infants with abnormal renal function to insure that a true anatomic, urethral obstruction is not present. This “lethal variant” and the potential confusion with posterior urethral valves “masquerading” as prune belly syndrome must be diagnosed, as treatment changes dramatically. In addition, the VCUG demonstrates vesicoureteral reflux in up to 85% of patients and assesses bladder emptying. All infants are treated with antibiotics prior to sterile catheterization to decrease the risk of infection. In general, the radiologic assessment of the urinary tract is tailored by the management philosophy of the individual urologic surgeon. Contrast studies requiring risky instrumentation are avoided in those infants with good renal function.22\n\nAfter initial evaluation, a mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) renal scan can provide both functional and anatomic information. Blood flow, differential renal function and drainage in response to furosemide (Lasix) can be assessed and compared with subsequent studies. The limitations of diuresis renography in demonstrating obstruction in patients with prune belly syndrome have been noted.49 A Whitaker test is occasionally necessary as the definitive study to demonstrate significant obstruction, although this is mostly of historical significance. Dimercaptosuccinic (DMSA) acid renal scan is performed rather than an excretory urogram (IVP) to evaluate renal size, tubular mass, and differential function. Comparative studies are invaluable to assess renal growth and scarring as these patients require long-term follow up. Some groups have advocated for magnetic resonance urography (MRU) in these patients due to its high resolution and excellent functional and anatomic data that allows for detailed visualization of upper tract abnormalities which may also be useful in operative planning.50 As shown in (Table 1), there are three major categories of neonatal presentation as described by Woodard.1,2\n\nManagement and Outcomes\n\nPrenatal Management\n\nIn Utero Intervention\n\nWith improved maternal–fetal advanced imaging and diagnostic techniques, prune belly syndrome can be suspected by imaging early in pregnancy. Fetal intervention usually addresses the oligohydramnios or anhydramnios that is associated with pulmonary hypoplasia, the leading cause of perinatal mortality. Criteria for intrauterine intervention includes second or third trimester gestation, severe oligohydramnios, megacystis, advanced hydronephrosis, normal karyotype, limited extent of other detected congenital anomalies and serial favorable fetal aspirated urinalyses.51,52,53 Although several reports of vesicoamniotic shunt procedures for fetal obstructive uropathy exist, reviews have failed to document a beneficial effect of fetal intervention on subsequent renal function and also pulmonary function cannot be assured despite restoration of normal amniotic fluid levels. As the majority of patients with prune belly syndrome have no demonstrable evidence of obstruction and renal function does not correlate with the amount of dilatation present in the urinary tract, the risks and benefits of in utero intervention must be carefully weighed.53\n\nPostnatal Management\n\nThe overall goals of management are to preserve renal function and prevent infection. The attainment of these goals are possible via a variety of therapeutic approaches, which range from watchful waiting to immediate surgical reconstruction of the urinary tract. Early surgical intervention in the neonate is avoided, unless a rising creatinine or infection occurs, requiring early vesicostomy. As shown in (Table 2), management in these patients depend on the severity category at presentation.\n\nTable 2 Presentation and management of different categories based on Woodwards criteria of neonatal presentation\n\n\n  \n    \n      Severity Category\n      Presentation\n      Management\n      Follow up and Outcomes\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      I\n      Pronounced oligohydramnios secondary to renal dysplasia and/or outlet obstruction resulting in severe pulmonary hypoplasia and skeletal abnormalities\n      In those few infants surviving the pulmonary insult, high urinary diversion by cutaneous pyelostomy has been attempted however, recovery of renal function is not usually possible as a result of severe underlying renal dysplasia.\n      These neonates often expire within a few days and interventions are limited. Associated with prenatal oligohydramnios and postnatal pulmonary hypoplasia usually die in the immediate postnatal period due to pulmonary complications.\n    \n    \n       \n      Potter’s facies may be present and is secondary to oligohydramnios. Features include micrognathia, wide set eyes, flattened palpebral fissures, prominent epicanthus, flattened nasal bridge, low-set ears lacking cartilage and skeletal deformities.\n      Only catheterization may be needed\n       \n    \n    \n       \n      Cases of urethral atresia are typically in this most severe category.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n      II\n      Moderate renal insufficiency and moderate-severe hydroureteronephrosis Pulmonary hypoplasia is not a prominent feature.\n      These children are placed on long-term prophylactic antibiotics and are serially monitored for infection and any decrease in renal function.\n      Lifelong postoperative surveillance needed to evaluate renal function and optimal drainage of both upper and lower tracts with functional and anatomic studies.\n    \n    \n       \n       \n      Aggressive urinary tract reconstruction is pursued with documentation of infection, failure of adequate renal growth or decreasing renal function.\n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n      However, surgical reconstruction is usually delayed until the infant is 3 months of age or more to allow pulmonary maturation.\n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n      If renal insufficiency is severe or infection is initially present, a period of urinary diversion by means of cutaneous vesicostomy is recommended.\n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n      Cutaneous ureterostomies probably add little to improve drainage. In addition, the upper ureter is anatomically and histologically the most normal and should be preserved if later tailored reconstruction is elected.\n       \n    \n    \n      III\n      Mild triad features or incomplete forms\n      Constitute the majority of patients demonstrate good renal function, despite gross dilatation of the upper and lower urinary tract.\n      Similar to category 2, life-long surveillance needed.\n    \n    \n       \n      Renal function is typically normal or mildly impaired and there is no pulmonary insufficiency.\n      Early surgical intervention to reconstruct the urinary tract is not usually necessary and these patients are managed with long term antibiotic prophylaxis and serial assessment of renal function by selective imaging techniques.\n      Development of urinary infections or decrease in renal function mandates further specific evaluation in the form of urodynamic assessment or diuretic renogram to document either lower tract or upper tract obstruction that may necessitate intervention.\n    \n    \n       \n       \n      These patients benefit from early orchiopexy and abdominoplasty as correction of the abdominal wall may improve defecation and voiding efficiency.\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nOperative Interventions in Prune Belly Syndrome\n\nUrinary Tract\n\nA characteristic finding in PBS is low-pressure dilation of the whole urinary tract, which extends from the renal pelvis proximally to the urethra distally. The bladder is typically enlarged and hypotonic, with elevated compliance and low-pressure vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) present in approximately 75% of patients. While these large volume compliant bladders allows for low pressure storage, they often demonstrate incomplete emptying secondary to reduced detrusor contractility. Therefore, initial urologic intervention is directed at bladder drainage in order to avoid urinary tract infection (UTI) and thereby preserve renal function. As such, circumcision, prophylactic antibiotics timed/double voiding are often implemented to decrease the incidence of UTI and protect the upper tracts from further insult.54,55,56,57 When such conservative management fails to prevent infection and achieve adequate emptying, these children may require reduction cystoplasty and /or appendicovesicostomy to facilitate clean intermittent catheterization and/or antireflux surgery for managing the associated VUR.58,59,60\n\nAbdominal Wall\n\nAbdominal wall reconstruction where the more normal peripheral abdominal wall is advanced to support this abnormal, deficient central portion is an important consideration in the surgical management of PBS patients. In addition to cosmesis, abdominoplasty has also been shown to improve functional bladder dynamics independent of genitourinary reconstruction. Urodynamic testing is often performed preoperatively to determine the need for any concomitant bladder procedures such as appendicovesicostomy in cases of incomplete emptying and/or ureteral reimplantation when VUR is present. Traditionally, three surgical procedures with their modifications have been reported in the literature for correction of the abdominal wall defects associated with PBS.61,62,63 While the Randolph procedure involves excision of a portion of the lower abdominal wall to correct vertical fascial redundancy, the Monfort (Figure 4), (Figure 5), (Figure 6), (Figure 7), (Figure 8) and Ehrlich procedures both use vertical overlapping of the fascia to correct lateral redundancy along with strengthening of the abdominal wall. A laparoscopic approach to abdominoplasty has also been reported, proving beneficial in both assisting with the reconstruction itself as well as delineating the varying degrees of muscular deficiency.64 It is also noted that PBS patients may each display unique features with regard to the variation of severity and pattern of abdominal musculature deficiency, such as a particular area with a complete paucity of muscle. Smith and colleagues recently reported their adaptations to the Monfort procedure which allows for more individualized correction of abdominal wall laxity and positioning the umbilicus to a more anatomically correct location.\n\n\nFigure 4 A midline incision from xiphoid to pubis circumscribing umbilicus.\n\n\nFigure 5 Raising the skin flap between subcutaneous fat and fascial layer.

Pants -over-vest closure provides additional support and skin flaps from both the sides are closed are closed subsequently.\n\nCryptorchidism\n\nBilateral intra-abdominal testicles are another trademark feature of PBS. Traditional single-stage orchidopexy and single versus staged Fowler- Stephens orchidopexy are all potential options for managing the testicles, depending on gonadal vessel length, and can be performed via an open or laparoscopic approach depending upon surgeon preference.65,66,67 The lax abdominal wall can lead to potential technical issues in creating and maintaining pneumoperitoneum which can be minimized by using radially expanding trocars and high gas flow rates during laparoscopic orchidopexy as described by Philip et al.67,68 It should be emphasized, however, that in the absence of any overriding cardiopulmonary issue, orchidopexy should be performed as early as possible as recommended by the current [AUA guideline](https://www.auanet.org/guidelines/guidelines/cryptorchidism-guideline) and not delayed until older in childhood, so as to enhance the chances of fertility and improve the chances of a single stage procedure, as gonadal vessel division is less likely when orchidopexy is performed early.\n\nComprehensive Reconstruction\n\nComprehensive reconstruction in the prune belly patient involves reduction cystoplasty, resection of the redundant distal ureter and bilateral ureteral tapered reimplantation.69 Reconstruction may be combined with the performance of the abdominoplasty and bilateral orchiopexy, usually prior to two years of age. This aggressive approach has been used in many series and have shown good outcomes with respect to stable or improved renal function.\n\nIn the approach described by Woodward, a wide lower abdominal incision is made that extends from the tip of the 12th rib, along the anterior superior iliac spine to the pubis and then curves upward to the opposite 12th rib. This tends to spare the segmental nerve and vascular supply of the abdominal wall left for reconstruction. In addition, at the time of excision of the redundant abdominal wall, that portion with the most muscle fibers is preserved. The exposure of the urinary tract provided with this incision is exceptional. However, use of this technique has decreased given concerns regarding interruption of the epigastric vessels and redundant lateral abdominal tissue. Instead, most surgeons favor the Monfort approach (Figure 4), (Figure 5), (Figure 6), (Figure 7), and (Figure 8)\n\nThe posterior peritoneum is incised along the length of the ureters. The spermatic vessels are mobilized distally; care being taken not to compromise the peritoneal attachments of the vas deferens if a Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy is required. The bladder is opened in the midline with cautery. The laterally placed ureteral orifices are recognized and each ureter is mobilized. The extreme length of the mobilized ureters allows for resection of its distal third, usually the most abnormal portion. Formal tapering or imbrication is performed. The ureters are then reimplanted, using a transtrigonal or Leadbetter Politano technique. Stenting of the operated ureters is performed and these are brought out through the bladder and separate abdominal incisions.\n\nPrior to reduction cystoplasty, the testes are mobilized with a wide apron of posterior peritoneum. In some cases, the testes may be adherent to the enlarged bladder and must be meticulously mobilized to preserve blood supply. If the reconstruction is performed prior to 2 years of age, a standard orchiopexy with intact spermatic vessels can be performed 80% of the time. Otherwise, a delayed or formal Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy will be necessary\n\nThe bladder is reduced in size by resection of the urachal remnant and the huge bladder dome. A strip of bladder epithelium can be removed from one of the lateral walls and closed by the vest-over-pants technique. The bladder is drained with a Malecot catheter. The previously mobilized testes are brought up through the distal abdominal wall at the pubic tubercle. A dartos pouch is created in the scrotum and each testis is secured in the pouch with permanent sutures.\n\nThe redundant abdominal wall is then held taut and marked in the midline and laterally at the costovertebral angles to outline the tissue to be excised. Avoidance of removal of excessive amounts of abdominal wall is critical. The second line of incision parallels the previous incision. A large wedge of full thickness abdominal wall is removed. The closure of the abdominal wall is commenced by placement of key sutures of 0 or 1–0 non-absorbable sutures at the anterior iliac spines and at each pubic tubercle. These sutures should include the periosteum of the bone and a full thickness of the proximal opposing tissue edge. The tension created occasionally allows for removal of additional lateral redundant abdominal wall. Each section between the key sutures is closed with interrupted sutures opposing the full thickness of the abdominal tissue. The subcutaneous tissue is closed to prevent dead space and the skin is approximated with a subcuticular absorbable suture.\n\nLong Term Outcomes\n\nQuality of Life\n\nThough the overall outlook for the patient with PBS for survival and for quality of life has improved considerably, PBS profoundly affects health-related quality of life in affected children as well as in their caregivers.70 The patients have compromised physical, emotional, social, and school functioning and the caregivers report an overall lower quality of life because of the burdens that families with chronically ill children often face. Another study demonstrated that surviving individuals with PBS had a significantly high incidence of orthopaedic, gastrointestinal, and cardiopulmonary conditions that negatively affected their quality of life, whereas treatment of these non-GU conditions improves their lives.70,71 These studies stress the fact that, as primarily responsible for the overall health of these medically complex patients, the paediatric urologist must be aware and prepared not only to treat the late genitourinary complications of PBS but also to evaluate and diagnose the non-genitourinary comorbidities that directly affect their medical and surgical treatment and quality of life, as they pass through puberty into adulthood.\n\nRenal Failure and Transplantation\n\nUp to 30% of patients, generally those with initial impaired renal function, develop chronic renal failure during childhood or adolescence. Early end stage renal disease (ESRD) is thought to be secondary to renal dysplasia, whereas kidney failure occurring later is often attributed to parenchymal damage from repeated infections and the increased pressure transmitted to the upper tracts generated from incomplete emptying.72 Yalcinkaya et al reported that the median age of initial renal replacement therapy for boys with PBS was 7 years, which was significantly younger than male patients with other types of LUTO or renal dysplasia, with a median age at first transplant at just 9.3 years.73\n\nRenal transplantation is necessary for these patients to ensure normal growth and development, and success with transplantation in patients with PBS can be expected to equal that in other age-matched groups. Since the first report in 1976, both cadaver and living-related donor kidneys have been successfully transplanted in patients with PBS, with age at transplantation ranging from 8 months to 21 years of age.73,74 Prior to transplantation, bilateral nephroureterectomies are usually performed in all cases to avoid infectious complications. Radiographic and urodynamic assessment of the lower urinary tract is recommended to insure absence of obstruction and balanced voiding. The use of clean intermittent catheterization to empty the decompensated bladder is not a contraindication to renal transplantation. All patients should be kept on antibiotic prophylaxis. An unusual complication of transplantation in prune belly syndrome is allograft torsion.75 The torsion, with resultant graft loss, was a result of lack of abdominal wall tone. Nephropexy has been recommended to avoid this disastrous complication. In a retrospective review of eight patients with prune belly syndrome who underwent transplantation, there was no statistically significant difference in patient deaths, graft survival or graft function when compared to age-matched controls. A more recent retrospective analysis of graft survival at 10 years of 47% was not statistically significantly different from age-matched controlled patients,73,74\n\nBladder Function\n\nAs mentioned before, urodynamic studies of patients with PBS generally show normal compliance with decreased sensibility and contractile activity. As a consequence, some patients tend to retain large volumes in the bladder, which develops progressive capacity associated to significant postvoid residual. The lack of abdominal support, the eventual association of polyuria, and the negative behaviour of some patients in regard to timed voiding usually increase this tendency. Therefore, to prevent further bladder dilation and upper urinary tract deterioration, all patients, even those who underwent lower urinary tract reconstruction and abdominoplasty, have to be trained as early as possible and constantly reinforced to empty their bladders on schedule, eventually associating it to double or triple voiding and Valsalva's or Credé's maneuvers.76 In the case of progressive unbalanced voiding, if such a program is not feasible or ineffective, intermittent bladder catheterization is mandatory, either per urethra or through a Mitrofanoff channel. Eventually, effective voiding is achieved with growth and improved proprioceptive sensation, as well as increased abdominal support. In the series of Lopes et al, 17.4% of the patients submitted to reconstruction of the urinary tract required intermittent catheterization through urethra or a Mitrofanoff channel. Rarely, some of these children reacquire normal voiding with good bladder emptying.\n\nGrowth and Musculoskeletal Development\n\nNormal growth can be expected in most of the patients with normal renal function, although growth retardation in the absence of renal compromise was observed in one-third of the patients in one series.34 Thoracic deformities, such as pectus excavatum, usually do not compromise pulmonary function in the older child and may show some improvement with growth and exercise. Patients with the syndrome may present musculoskeletal abnormalities that impair function and cosmesis like scoliosis, lordosis, ankle and hip abnormalities that may need early orthopaedic intervention. In a recent study, older patients and their families were informed that the correction of musculoskeletal problems through abdominoplasty and/or orthopaedic surgeries was the most common way for health providers to improve their patients' quality of life.\n\nSexual Function and Fertility\n\nA normal pattern of secondary sexual development can be expected as hormone production by the testes is preserved, but sexual function may be impaired by retrograde ejaculation. Primary infertility is usually the norm and if affected then this is thought to be due to a combination of testicular histologic abnormalities with impaired spermatogenesis , structural defects of the ducts, and prostatic abnormalities leading to retrograde ejaculation.77 However, paternity is achievable with assisted reproductive techniques (ART) especially those who had successful early orchidopexy and there are reports of normal live births in adult patients with classic PBS, made possible by sperm retrieval techniques and intracytoplasmic sperm injection.78,79,80 Normal pregnancy with assisted vaginal delivery has also been described in a female patient with the syndrome.81\n\nConclusions\n\nAs with most complex congenital anomalies, the key to management of PBS is a multidisciplinary team-based approach providing individualized care. Given the wide spectrum of disease, the treatment of prune belly syndrome is patient specific. When infection and stasis compromise renal growth or function, aggressive surgical intervention to promote drainage is advised. The testes in these infants are placed in the scrotum early for improved fertility purposes and can be accomplished by laparoscopic or open techniques. Because of the changing urodynamic condition of the lower urinary tract and its effects on renal function and urinary infection, all patients with prune belly syndrome require careful lifelong urologic surveillance.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Prune-belly syndrome (PBS) includes a constellation of anomalies with variable degrees of severity. The three major findings are deficiency of the abdominal musculature, bilateral intra-abdominal testes and anomalous urinary tract.\n  The urinary tract is characterized by variable degrees of hydronephrosis, renal dysplasia, dilated tortuous ureters, enlarged bladder, and dilated prostatic urethra/ megalourethra.\n  Additional associated anomalies involve the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, cardiac system and musculoskeletal system.\n  The most important determinant of long-term survival is usually the severity of the urinary tract anomaly, in particular, the degree of renal dysplasia.\n  Non-obstructive hydronephrosis is the rule. It is renal infection rather than obstruction that poses the greatest risk to renal function.\n  Initial urologic intervention is directed at bladder drainage and proper bladder emptying in order to avoid urinary tract infection (UTI) and thereby preserve renal function.\n  Surgical management is in the form of urinary tract reconstruction, abdominoplasty and bilateral orchidopexy which can be done separately or in a single stage in younger children.\n  Caring for patients with PBS requires a large multidisciplinary team approach to help these children thrive, gain weight, and be prepared for urological surgery if needed.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWoodard S JR, E.A..

        "title": "Undescended Testis",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nUndescended testis (UDT) refers to the state that the testicle is not located in the scrotum but in an abnormal location such as in the abdominal cavity of the groin (Figure 1) The testicles are formed and remain in the abdominal cavity for a while during fetal life, then gradually descend and move down to the scrotum. Cryptorchidism includes undescended testes located anywhere in the normal course of the descending process and ectopic testes which is not the usual course of testicular descendant. Undescended testis should be differentiated from retractile testis. A retractile testis is a testicle locates below the external inguinal ring but can be manipulated to the upper scrotum and is prone to ascend to its original position and/or is a testicle that has finished its normal descending process and can remain in the scrotum but easily move back and forth between the scrotum and the groin (Video 1).\n\n\nFigure 1 Empty scrotum on the left side in a patient with undescended testis.\n\n\nVideo 1 Demonstration of a retractile testis.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nUndescended testis is one of the most common congenital anomalies of the male newborn child. The risk of undescended testes is 3.5 fold higher in males with a sibling with undescended testes, and 2.3 fold higher in males with a father with the condition.1 Incidence in the full-term neonates is reported to be 1.0–4.5% and unilateral cases are 2 times more common than bilateral cases.2 About 70% of cryptorchids descend at 3 mo of age under influence of mini puberty and the incidence of undescended testis decreases to 0.8-1.2% at 1 year of age.3,4\n\nEtiology\n\nThere is no clear risk factors associated to (UDT), however maternal smoking during pregnancy, birth measures including birth weight, and gestational age, family history of undescended testis, and rare genetic variants such as INSL3 mutations are been associated with undescended testis Normal testicular descent relies on an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Although the exact etiology is still unknown, its genetic, hormonal (HPG axis dysfunction, congenital hypogonadism, testicular dysplasia), and anatomical (short vas deferens and spermatic vessels) factors are implicated. Birth weight &lt;2.5 kg, small for gestational age, premature, low maternal estrogen levels and placental insufficiency, reduced human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secretion were suggested as risk factors for undescended testis. In addition, exposure to environmental factors such as continuous exposure to organochlorine compounds, monoesters of phthalates, maternal smoking, maternal diabetes has been reported as risk factor for developmental disorders in men. However, none of these factors was found to be solely responsible for the pathogenesis of undescended testis.\n\nNormal Testicular Descent\n\nMammals can be separated into those with a scrotum and those without. The general hypothesis for the evolution of the scrotum in some mammals is that it provides a cool environment, which is below the core body temperature for better spermatogenesis. However, we have no data to support or reject the temperature hypothesis because some mammals can reproduce with their internal testicles and some ascrotal species have their testicular cooling mechanisms.5,6 Reduced rate of germ-cell mutations at lower body temperatures may have been a driving factor of development of scrotum in mammals. Some animals with testes stay close to the kidney in the abdominal cavity extend their epididymis to a subcutaneous location, which may provide a cooling effect during sperm storage and maturation.7 In that case, testicular locations might have followed the location of the epididymis. In humans, the scrotal temperature is maintained at an optimal temperature for spermatogenesis about 2.7 ℃ lower than the core body temperature.8\n\nAlthough the testes and ovaries originate from the same embryological tissues adjacent to the kidney, testes take the long journey out of the abdominal cavity.9 Normal testicular descent involves a transabdominal phase and an inguinoscrotal phase and both of which take place prenatally in the human. Transabdominal descent occurs in the 12th week of gestation when the testis moves down towards the deep inguinal ring. It occurs as a combination of push and pull interchange.10 Before the start of the descent, the developing gonad is anchored by the cranial suspensory ligament and the caudal genito-inguinal ligament, or gubernaculum.11 The distal gubernaculum enlarges during the transabdominal phase of the descent making the male gubernaculum short and fat. This swelling reaction anchors the testis to the inguinal canal (Figure 2) The inguinal wall muscles differentiate around the swollen gubernaculum, also called the bulb, to make the inguinal canal. Insulin-like hormone 3 (INSL3) is known to be the regulating hormone of the swelling reaction.12,13,14 Leydig cells of the testis secrete INSL3 to stimulate the swelling reaction and it keep the testis close to the inguinal abdominal wall as the fetal abdomen enlarges.14 Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) secreted from the Sertoli cells of the testis is also suggested to have a role in testicular descent. In children with mutations of the AMH gene or its receptor, they have cryptorchidism with persisting infantile uterus and fallopian tubes, known as the persistent müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS).14\n\n\nFigure 2 The undifferentiated gonad is initially located high in the abdomen, anchored by the cranial suspensory ligament. INSL3 causes the swelling and enlargement of the gubernaculum to pull the developing testis toward the inguinal region.\n\nThe inguinoscrotal phase of descent occurs between 25 and 35 weeks. The overall process is quite similar in most mammals.15 During this stage the testes transit through the inguinal canal to finally reside in the scrotum. The gubernaculum elongates towards the scrotum along with the processus vaginalis. After the gubernaculum reaches the scrotum, the bulb resorbs to leave a fibrous remnant adherent to the inside of the scrotum. The proximal processus vaginalis closes to prevent inguinal hernia or hydrocele in the human. Many other mammals such as mice and rats have a patent processus vaginalis for their lifetime. In the human, the processus vaginalis finally involutes completely and enables the spermatic cord to elongate normally after birth. The inguinoscrotal phase of testicular descent is under the control of androgens. In animal models, it was found that, depending on the androgen action, the sensory branches of the genitofemoral nerve control gubernacular development which is modulated by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).\n\nClassification of Undescended Testes\n\nIn general, undescended testes are classified as palpable or non-palpable testes. Whether the testes are palpable or not decides the diagnostic tests and treatment strategy, and also the prognosis. Testes are movable by the contraction of the cremasteric muscle. Therefore the exact location of the testes is to be measured before 6 months of age when the cremasteric reflex is weak, or under general anesthesia. About 80% of undescended testes are palpable around the inguinal area. In case the testis is not palpable, it may locate in the abdominal cavity or agenesis, atrophic or vanishing testes.\n\nAssociated Pathology\n\nAbnormal Germ Cell Development\n\nThe histologic development of prepubertal cryptorchid testes has been studied in many observational types of research. These studies provide strong evidence that abnormal germ cell development is often present after early infancy in cryptorchid testes. The number of spermatogonia per tubule is reduced after infancy and fails to increase normally with age in cryptorchid and contralateral scrotal testes to a lesser degree.16 Transformation of gonocytes to spermatogonia is reported to be impaired in cryptorchid testes. The ratio of gonocytes to spermatogonia appears to be normal in cryptorchid testes at about 1.5 months of age, delayed disappearance of gonocytes, and appearance of adult dark spermatogonia occurs in the cryptorchid testes compared with the contralateral scrotal testes. It was reported that the cryptorchid testis is not significantly smaller at birth but grows less well than the scrotal testis.17\n\nInfertility\n\nA history of cryptorchidism is well known to be associated with subfertility. In a series of well-designed case-control studies of fertility in cryptorchidism which analyzed a large cohort of men who underwent orchiopexy and control group of similar age, 65% of former bilateral, 90% of former unilateral, and 93% of controls were successfully achieved paternity.18,19 According to the studies reporting testicular histology at the time of orchiopexy, fertility potential was greatest when orchiopexy was performed before 1 year of age.20,21,22 Therefore, orchiopexy is recommended to be performed before 1 year of age.\n\nRisk of Malignancy\n\nThe risk of testicular germ cell tumor in males with a history of cryptorchidism has been well known to be increased. The relative risk of malignant transformation in an undescended testis is 2.5 to 8 overall and 2 to 3 in boys undergoing prepubertal orchiopexy.23 About 10% of men presenting testicular germ cell tumor are men with a history of cryptorchidism. In a review of tumor pathology in treated versus untreated cryptorchidism, seminoma is most commonly associated with persistently cryptorchid testis and non-seminomatous germ cell tumor is the majority of scrotal testes.23 Today this as been showed that is not related testicular self-examination is recommended for testicular cancer screening, and it should be taught to all patients with a history of cryptorchidism after they reach puberty.\n\nHernia\n\nMore than 90% of cryptorchism accompanies patent processus vaginalis and the hernia can occur in 25%.\n\nEpididymis Abnormality\n\nThe prevalence of epididymal anomalies in cryptorchidism is reported to be 32% to 72%.24 Epididymal anomalies may occur due to abnormal involution of the mesonephric duct adjacent to the normal testis.25 Epididymal-testicular fusion anomalies are reported to be strongly associated with a more proximal position of the testis. Epididymal anomalies may result in impaired fertility due to difficulties in sperm transportation and maturation.26\n\nDiagnosis of Undescended Testis\n\nBefore the physical examination, it is essential to ask about early delivery, whether the mother is using female hormones or exposure to female hormones, central nervous system lesions, and previous groin surgery history. A family history of other congenital anomalies or infertility accompanying cryptorchidism should be checked. Because the palpability of cryptorchidism is more important than the location of the testes, a careful physical examination is essential. In case of doubt, it is recommended to repeat the examination or refer to a specialist. In particular, in case of non-palpable, it is important to check under anesthesia before surgery. For the physical examination method the room need to be warm. Then, with the patient in the frog-legged position, first check the size, location, and surface of the contralateral testis, and then with a warm hand, sweep from the iliac crest on the affected side to the pubic symphysis to determine the presence and location of the testicle. If the testicle is palpable, it should also be checked that it descends to the scrotum.27 If it is difficult to palpate, such as a chubby infant or an obese child, have them sit with their legs crossed or squat to examine them and apply lubricating jelly to their hands for better palpation of the testicles. In the absence of one testis, compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral testis may be seen. Once the testicles are palpable, there is no need for further examination, because the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not as high as that of expert urologists, and the treatment is rarely different depending on the results of imaging tests. Imaging studies cannot certainly verify whether a testis is present or not.28 In clinical practice, ultrasound or MRI is only recommended in selected cases with suspicious DSD patients.29\n\nFor non-palpable testicles that cannot be confirmed by physical examination and radiology examination, a diagnostic laparoscopy or exploratory surgery through the inguinal or scrotal incision is performed. Conventionally, if a testicle or testicular nubbin were found through inguinal exploration, orchiopexy or orchiectomy was followed. With the advent of laparoscopy, it has become possible to check the presence or absence of testes, their location, and the state of the vas deferens and gonad vessels. On laparoscopic findings, if the testicular vessels end blindly, it can be diagnosed as vanishing testis and no further management is necessary. If spermatic vessels are observed to enter into the internal inguinal ring, inguinal or scrotal exploration should be followed.\n\nIn case of bilateral non-palpable testes with any sign of DSD, such as genital ambiguity, or severe hypospadias, further endocrinological and genetic assessment is mandatory.30 In children under 3 months of age, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone are measured. In children aged 3 months or older, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation test is recommended. If testosterone is barely measured and LH and FSH are elevated, it can be assessed as an anorchidism. In the hCG stimulation test, after intramuscular injection of 2,000 IU of hCG for 3 days, serum testosterone is measured on the 5th day. However, since there is a possibility of a false negative, surgical confirmation is necessary for all children whose gonadotropin levels are within the normal range without palpation of both testicles regardless of whether they respond to the hCG stimulation test.\n\nTreatment of Undescended Testis\n\nThe goal of treatment for undescended testicles is to lower the risk of infertility by minimizing the histological degeneration of the testicles by placing the testicles into the scrotum at an early stage and to make it easier to detect testicular cancer, which has a higher incidence than normally descended one. In addition, the secondary goal is to correct the accompanying lesions, prevent complications such as testicular torsion, alleviate the psychological impact of the patient, and improve the cosmesis. Until now, it has been recognized that orchiopexy cannot prevent testicular cancer, but recently, it has been reported that early surgery can lower the risk of testicular cancer. The timing of treatment for undescended testicles is important. Orchiopexy should be performed after 6 months of age and within the subsequent year, and by age eighteen months at the latest.31 The rationale for such early surgery is that natural descent of the testicles after 6 months of age is unlikely, there is no significant difference in risks of general anesthesia or surgical technique, and the possibility of histological damage to the testicles increases after this age.31,32 And there are also concerns for children over 18 months of age that might have high separation anxiety and fear of castration due to surgery, which may impact the children’s mental health.\n\nSurgical treatment, orchiopexy, is the standard treatment for undescended testicles, and hormone therapy can be selectively used depending on the location and condition of the undescended testicles. When testicles degenerate or disappear and only remnants or nubbin of testicles are visible, or when adult undescended testes are anatomically and morphologically abnormal, or when testicular fixation is impossible, the testicles are excised. Orchiectomy should be carefully decided only when the contralateral testicle is normal, and the contralateral orchiopexy is performed simultaneously to prevent testicular torsion. Since the retractile testis is a normal variant, it is recommended to follow up annually until puberty or until the testes no longer migrate upward.\n\nHormonal Therapy for Testicular Descent\n\nHormonal therapy for testicular decent is a debatable issue. However, hCG, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are mainly used. The rationale for hormonal therapy is based on the experimental results that undescended testicles result from an abnormality in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, testicular descent is regulated by male androgens, and high concentrations of active metabolites synthesized in the testes are involved in the pathogenesis of cryptorchidism. hCG acts directly on Leydig cells like LH from the pituitary, whereas GnRH increases testosterone production in the testis by secreting LH through hypothalamic stimulation. It is presumed that the hormone affects the spermatic cord and the cremasteric muscle to induce the natural descent of the testicles and enhance fertility. However, the success rate of hormonal therapy using hCG or GnRH is only 20% and almost 20% of these descended testes may re-ascend later.33,34\n\nHormonal Therapy for Fertility\n\nHormonal therapy may improve fertility indices and can serve as an additional implementation to orchiopexy.35,36 It was reported that men who were treated with GnRH in childhood had better semen analysis compared with men who underwent orchiopexy alone or placebo treatment.35 On the contrary it is reported that hCG therapy may be harmful to future spermatogenesis by increased apoptosis of germ cells, inflammatory changes in the testes, and reduced testicular volume in adulthood.37 Evidence on the long-term effect of hormonal treatment for cryptorchidism is still lacking and it is difficult to select the best candidate with undescended testis who can benefit from hormonal therapy.\n\nSurgical Treatment\n\nPalpable Testis\n\nIn most cases of palpable undescended testes, orchiopexy is performed through an inguinal incision. The most important point in orchiopexy is to secure enough length to lower the testicle to the scrotum without tension. The operation consists of the following four steps. First, the testis and spermatic cord are separated from the surrounding tissues to secure mobility. Secondly, high- ligation is performed to close the process vaginalis. And thirdly, to lower the testicle to the bottom of the scrotum without tension, sometimes further retroperitoneal dissection is necessary to separate the vas deferens. Finally, a shallow sub-dartos pouch is made in the ipsilateral scrotum, and the testes are tucked in and fixed. If the length of the spermatic cord is not sufficient with these basic techniques, the Prentiss method is required to reduce the distance to the scrotum by cutting the inferior epigastric vessel at the bottom of the inguinal canal or passing the spermatic cord underneath it. Not typically for the palpable UDT, autotransplantation of the testis using a microsurgical technique to anastomose the testicular artery to the epigastric artery has been reported (see below).\n\nNon-Palpable Testis\n\nSince the presence and condition of the testes are important in the operation of non-palpable testicles, the testes should be examined again under anesthesia. If they are still not palpable, open inguinal exploration or diagnostic laparoscopy is performed. The laparoscopic findings of non-palpable testes are: first, the testicular vessel descends through the internal inguinal ring. In this case, an incision is made in the inguinal or scrotal skin to explore the presence of the testis. If the testicles are found to be normal, orchiopexy is performed. The second scenario is that the testicular vessel ends in a blind end in the abdominal cavity near the internal inguinal ring, which suggests a vanished testis, so the operation is stopped without further surgery. Finally, when a testicle is found in the abdominal cavity, the surgical decision is made based on the size of the testicle, its location in the abdominal cavity, the length of the spermatic vessel, the patient's age, the contralateral testis, and the surgeon's experience. The overall surgical success rate is known to be 67-84%.\n\nOrchiopexy is Performed in One of Three Ways\n\nFowler-Stephens Orchiopexy\n\nThis is a procedure that secures the spermatic cord length by excising the internal spermatic blood vessel containing the testicular artery, and the survival of the testicle is dependent on the blood supply of the cremasteric artery and the vas deferens artery. The one-stage technique is a method of resection of internal spermatic vessels and fixation of the testicles at the same time. In the two-stage Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy, the internal spermatic vessels are ligated as the primary operation, and the supply of collateral blood vessels from the abdominal cavity to the testicles is increased for at least 6 months, and then the testes are lowered to the scrotum by a secondary operation. One stage or two-staged Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy may be performed laparoscopically.\n\nLaparoscopic Orchiopexy\n\nSince laparoscopic surgery is performed with an enlarged field of view, it has the advantage of being able to minimize damage to blood vessels while dissecting extensively, and to secure the shortest distance of testicular mobilization (Figure 3) and (Video 1). Laparoscopic orchiopexy includes a method in which the testicle is lowered to the scrotum while preserving the internal spermatic vessels and Fowler-Stephens methods (Video 2). With the help of laparoscopy, microsurgical autotransplantation can be performed.\n\n\nFigure 3 Step by step explanatory images of the laparoscopic orchiopexy. (A) cutting the gubernaculum, (B) dissection of the peritoneum parallel to the vas deferens, (C) incision of the peritoneum parallel to the internal spermatic vessel, (D) neo-hiatus formation and delivery of the testis out of the abdomen to the scrotal location.\n\n\nVideo 2 Demonstration of Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy.\n\nAutotransplantation Using Microsurgery\n\nThis is performed in special cases where the testes are located deep in the abdominal cavity. First, the testes and spermatic cords are excised, fixed in the scrotum, and then the testicular blood vessels are connected to the lower abdominal wall blood vessels through micro-surgery to re-open blood flow. Although the success rate is relatively high, it is not an easy method of choice because it requires a high level of skill and effort required for vascular connection through microsurgery and requires careful postoperative treatment.\n\nOrchiectomy\n\nOrchiectomy is performed when a testicular function cannot be expected due to severe testicular atrophy or morphological abnormalities.\n\nComplications of Orchiopexy and Reoperation\n\nComplications of orchiopexy include testicular retraction, hematoma, ilioinguinal nerve injury, torsion of the spermatic cord, injury to the vas deferens, or testicular atrophy. Testicular atrophy is the most serious complication and occurs after excessive dissection of the spermatic cord or excessive use of electrocautery, twisting of the spermatic vessels, or Fowler Stephens orchiopexy when the testis is forced down with tension, affecting the blood supply testicular retraction is usually caused by insufficient retroperitoneal dissection, and the testicle is pulled up above the scrotum under the external inguinal ring or near the pubic tubercle. For reoperation, care must be taken to avoid the previous surgical site and make an incision, approach the scar tissue from the normal tissue, and remove the hard scar tissue including normal tissue so that the spermatic vessels are not damaged, and then perform testicular fixation.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  AUA guideline for cryptorchidism state surgery for UDT is best performed prior to 1 year of age\n  The Choosing Wisely campaign in cooperation with the AUA chose to emphasize that imaging for UDT should not be routinely performed, as confirmation of testicular position is best done by exam or if needed in case of non-palpable testis, laparoscopy.\n  Inguinal or scrotal orchiopexy has high rate of success with low complication rate\n  Laparoscopic orchiopexy is associated with higher rates of testicular atrophy\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nHutson JM, Balic A, T N.

        "title": "Congenital Hydrocele and Inguinal Hernia",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe following chapter will try to describe in a complete, yet concise and summarized way about the history, embryology and development, diagnosis and treatment of congenital inguinal hernia and hydrocele. We will emphasize details related to different aspects of the topic, offering useful tips for the reader for the appropriate approach to the pathology.\n\nHistory\n\nThe timeline described below emphasizes historical milestones and advances overtime related to congenital inguinal hernia and hydrocele (Figure 1)\n\nIn the year 25 AC, Celsus gave the first reference to hernia repair in children.\n\nAdvances in medicine as well as post operative patient care have improved surgical techniques and surgical outcomes over time. Nowadays the surgical procedure is done similarly worldwide with minimal variations depending on the surgeon preferences and the chosen approach (laparoscopic vs conventional) for repair.\n\n\nFigure 1 Timeline\n\nEmbryology\n\nHydrocele and congenital inguinal hernia appear as a result of failure in the process of obliteration of the processus vaginalis (PV), a peritoneal evagination created from coelomic epithelium which normally seals during the first year of age.\n\nHydrocele could be defined as a collection of fluid between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis (TV) formed when the PV remains patent. They may be classified as communicating, non-communicating, and cord hydrocele. If the lumen is wide enough, abdominal contents may be extruded into it and create an inguinal hernia.1\n\nAt the final stage of fetal life, the testes and ovaries will occupy a different position from what they did have in the embryo. The change in position of the testes is much more pronounced than that of the ovaries and includes its journey through the thickness of the abdominal wall to the scrotum.2\n\nThe events that govern testicular development and subsequent descent in males are:\n\n3rd Week\n\nThe primordial germ cells (extra-embryonic gametes), which are in the wall of the yolk sac, migrate towards the gonadal ridges (Figure 2)\n\n\nFigure 2 3rd week embryo\n\n6th Week\n\nThe undifferentiated gonad is attached to the posterior wall by the mesoperitoneum that, cranially, forms the diaphragmatic ligament and, caudally, the inguinal ligament (gubernaculum) (Figure 3)\n\n\nFigure 3 6th week embryo\n\n7th–8th Week\n\nThe sex cords penetrate the medulla originating the testicular cords, which reach the mesorchium and form the rete testis (Haller's network). Later, these are transformed into efferent cords. (Figure 4)\n\n\nFigure 4 7–8th week embryo\n\n10th–12th Week\n\nThe gubernaculum testis is attached distally to the labioscrotal ridge, which will serve as an axis around which the mesoderm is modeled, giving rise to the inguinal canal. A peritoneal evagination, processus vaginalis (coelomic epithelium), is formed following the gubernaculum’s trajectory towards the labioscrotal ridge. The first phase of the testicular descent occurs, in which the testis passes from its lumbar position to the vicinity of the external inguinal orifice (Figure 5)\n\n\nFigure 5 10–12th week embryo\n\n28th Week\n\nSecond phase of descent: the testicle passes through the already formed inguinal canal, reaching the scrotum between weeks 32 and 35 (Figure 6)\n\n\nFigure 6 28th week embryo\n\nTerm Newborn\n\nThe testicle is fixed at the scrotum (Figure 7)\n\nThe mechanical factors that could trigger the testicular descent to the scrotum are:\n\n\n  Distal traction generated by the gubernaculum testis.\n  Intra-abdominal pressure.\n\n\nOther possible determining factors include hormonal and neurological factors.2\n\n\nFigure 7 Newborn\n\nAs shown in the previous successive embryological illustrations, the processus vaginalis (PV) begins to obliterate shortly before birth. Complete closure is normally achieved during the first year of life. The tunica vaginalis (TV) remains surrounding the testis. Failure in the process of obliteration of the PV is then associated with hernia, hydrocele, and encysted cord hydrocele.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe incidence of congenital indirect inguinal hernia in full-term neonates is 3.5–5%, while in preterm infants it is considerably higher and ranges from 9–11%. It approaches 60% as birth weight decreases from 500 to 750 grams. Most series report a male preponderance over females ranging from 5:1 to 10:1.3\n\nOn the other hand, communicating hydroceles are common in newborns with an incidence of 2–5%; 90% of these resolve during the first year of life as a result of spontaneous closure.4\n\nCongenital inguinal hernias are more common on the right side (60%), 30% occur on the left side and 10% are bilateral. This distribution does not change with sex as even in girls a right-side-predominance exists.5\n\nEtiology / Pathogenesis\n\nThe anatomy of the inguinal canal varies slightly with age. In adults and children, the internal and external inguinal orifices are widely separated, whereas in young infants they practically overlap. In girls, the anatomy is similar except for the absence of spermatic elements which are replaced by the round ligament.3 The different types of hydroceles are illustrated in the image below (Figure 8)\n\n\nFigure 8 Types of hydroceles\n\nCongenital indirect inguinal hernia can be formed, as it was already mentioned, from a permeable PV allowing the extrusion of omentum, intestines, appendix or even ovaries or fallopian tube in females through the inguinal canal. A hernial sac may as well extend from the abdominal cavity, through the internal inguinal ring down to the TV, resulting in the so-called inguinoscrotal hernia.\n\nDirect inguinal hernias are very uncommon in the pediatric population, they are mostly seen in adults caused by posterior abdominal muscle weakness enabling intestines to slide into the groin.\n\nDiagnosis and Evaluation\n\nInguinal hernia and hydrocele can be diagnosed by physical exam without the strict use of images. The presence of a reducible asymptomatic firm bulge in the groin or scrotum in males or a mass in the labia majora in girls is suspicious of an inguinal hernia.\n\nIncarceration of the hernial sac should be suspected in a patient who presents with severe, sudden onset of pain and a hard, tender, fixed mass in the groin. If it is not reduced manually surgical reduction should follow.6,7\n\nPhysical exam should include evaluation of the patient in a supine position, reinforcing, if possible, the Valsalva maneuver to identify transient hernias; and the standing-up evaluation where the physician should palpate and compare both groins looking for thickening of the inguinal cord or a bulge. In males, correct descent of testicles should be checked and transillumination (light source over the scrotum showing absence of the testicular shadow) can sometimes help to confirm hydrocele.\n\nTips\n\n\n  During palpation, it is most important to feel the inguinal cord slide under the finger pads.\n  We suggest palpating the inguinal cord with the most skilled hand.\n  In neonates, hernias can be more often reduced. This should be done with compression of the herniated content upwards using the skilled hand while exerting pressure downwards with the other hand as to align both inguinal rings and direct herniated elements into the abdominal cavity (Figure 9)\n\n\n\nFigure 9 Hernia reduction maneuver in neonates.\n\nIf the physical exam is not confirmative, inguinal ultrasound may add information to the suspected diagnosis.8 Nonetheless, the physical exam is still the gold standard diagnostic method. The sensibility of ultrasound depends mainly on the operator’s skills and cooperation from the patient (stillness and Valsalva maneuver). The hernia contents can be hyperechoic due to omental fat, anechoic in the presence of fluid, or of mixed echogenicity with reverberations which correlates with the existence of air in the bowel loops’ lumen.9 The US could also rule out a contralateral inguinal hernia, or PV that could be repair in the same surgery.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis for inguinal lesions is often challenging due to semiological similarities to the physical exam. Once a tender palpable mass is detected, the physician should have in mind the following possible diagnosis making use of other complementary studies if a physical exam is not enough:\n\n\n  Undescended testis.\n  Hematoma / Inflammation.\n  Abscess.\n  Benign or malignant tumors / Metastatic or benign lymph node enlargement.\n  Round ligament varicosities.\n  Mesothelial cyst.\n\n\nTreatment Options\n\nThe treatment of inguinal hernia is always surgical, and the key aspect of treatment is to achieve a high ligation of the hernial sac.\n\nIn infants and toddlers, herniotomy can be performed through the external inguinal orifice without opening the aponeurosis as both orifices usually overlap. In older patients’ orifices are separate from each other. In such cases, it is advisable to open the external oblique aponeurosis in order to achieve a high ligation of the sac.3 The use of parietal mesh in pediatric patients is reserved for special cases.\n\nFor both hydrocele and inguinal hernias, surgical principles and techniques are very similar. When hydrocele is surgically treated, in addition to the high ligation of the sac, the distal aspect of it should be resected as well. This step is not imperative for inguinal hernias.\n\nInguinal hernias can be approached by either an open inguinal herniorrhaphy (OIH) or a laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR). The most important components of the procedure involve ensuring the hernial sac is emptied and entirely closed after surgery, preserving the integrity of vas deferens, testicular vessels, and ilioinguinal nerve. In girls, round ligament fixation should be done to ensure correct uterine fixation preventing future dyspareunia.\n\nOpen Inguinal Herniorrhaphy\n\nThe main steps of OIH are detailed below with schematic drawings of the maneuvers.\n\n\n  Transverse inguinal incision flowing the natural skin fold over the cord (Figure 10)\n  Dissection of the subcutaneous cellular tissue incising the scarpa fascia until the muscular aponeurosis is reached.\n  Incision over the muscular aponeurosis (not always needed) (Figure 11)\n  Extension of aponeurosis incision toward the superficial inguinal orifice.\n  The inguinal cord is then dissected on both sides and on the underside with blunt maneuvers. The cord is then repaired with an elastic loop.z\n  Cremasteric muscle is teased open by blunt dissection on the anteromedial surface of the cord and spread to expose the glistening peritoneum of the indirect hernia sac (Figure 12)\n  The cord and its contents (vessels, vas deferens) are dissected gently, separating it from the sac that will be in the anteromedial situation.\n  The cord´s contents are carefully set apart from the sac which is detached from the latter (Figure 13)\n  The hernial sac is opened and its content reduced to the abdominal cavity.\n  The hernial sac is twisted ensuring there is no content inside of it. An absorbable polyglactin knot is tied on its base and the sac is cut and lost into the abdominal cavity (Figure 14), (Figure 15), and (Figure 16)\n  Muscular Aponeurosis is closed with a continuous absorbable polyglactin suture if it is opened (Figure 17)\n  Separated knots are used to approximate subcutaneous tissue and an intradermal suture is used to approximate skin tissue (Figure 18)\n\n\n\nFigure 10 Inguinal incision infants and adolescents\n\n\nFigure 11 Incision over the muscular aponeurosis.\n\n\nFigure 12 Inguinal cord identification. Hernial sac dissection.\n\n\nFigure 13 Hernial sac dissection.\n\n\nFigure 14 Hernial sac is twisted ensuring no content is present inside.\n\n\nFigure 15 Hernial sac resected.\n\n\nFigure 16 Sutured proximal end lost into the abdominal cavity.\n\n\nFigure 17 Muscular aponeurosis closure.\n\n\nFigure 18 Subcutaneous and skin closure.\n\nTips\n\n\n  The authors recommend a transverse skin incision following skin fold.\n  Locate the femoral arch in the aponeurotic plane in more complex cases (girls with a bilateral hernia, obese children) to locate the superficial inguinal orifice.\n  Dissect the hernial sac always on the same side of the cord in a regulated manner\n\n\nLaparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair\n\nThe role of laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernias is not fully established. The approach is criticized for transforming an extraperitoneal procedure into a transperitoneal one. Detractors sustain that this technique implies a technically more complex surgery and that it results in a higher recurrence rate than the conventional approach.\n\nIn contrast, the advocates of the laparoscopic approach stress on the fact that this technique ensures reduced invasiveness, without manipulation of the chordal structures, and it can be useful for the correct diagnosis of associated direct and femoral hernias. Moreover, the contralateral internal ring can be clearly visualized and repaired if necessary. Finally, supporters endorse the improved cosmesis resulting after this surgery compared with a conventional incision (Table 1)10\n\nTable 1 The following table exhibits some advantages and disadvantages regarding LIHR:\n\n\n  \n    \n      ADVANTAGES\n      DISADVANTAGES\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Easy-going technique.\n      Costs.\n    \n    \n      Outpatient procedure.\n      Could be a longer surgery duration.\n    \n    \n      Cord structures remain untouched.\n      General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation is necessary.\n    \n    \n      Type of hernia is evident as well as the contralateral inguinal ring.\n      Increased possibility of injury to intra abdominal organs.\n    \n    \n      Clear visualization of the anatomy.\n      Longer learning curve.\n    \n    \n      Inspection of the adnexal in girls.\n      Possible cord damage in the long term\n    \n  \n\n\nPost-Operative Care and Follow-Up\n\nAs this is a one-day case surgery, postoperatively food and drinks can be initiated after recovery from the anesthetic. Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, anemia, prematurity, or those who required ventilatory support at the time of birth, should be observed after operative repair for at least 24 hours, monitored for episodes of apnea and/or bradycardia. Patients should be discharged with oral analgesics.\n\nActivity should be limited for 48 hours. Returning to normal activities as soon as the child feels capable. In children older than 6 years, activity restrictions should be more strict with no vigorous activity for 1 month period. Baths can be initiated the third day after surgery.\n\nFollow-up should be done 1 week after surgery for early complications followed by by clinical controls 1 month, 3 and 6 months post surgery before discharge.\n\nOutcomes, Complications, and Management\n\nDuring surgery, local complications include bleeding and injury to spermatic vessels and vas deferens. The use of magnifying loupes during the reconstruction of intraoperative injuries will make the repair more precise, especially in newborns.\n\nEarly complications after surgery may include local edema, hematoma, and wound infection.\n\nLate complications seen during follow-up may include recurrent hydrocele or hernia, iatrogenic displacement of the testis, and testicular atrophy. To avoid postoperative hydrocele, the anterior and lateral aspects of the sac can be partially resected, or the distal sac can be open completely.\n\nRecurrence is higher in males that are operated before the first year of age and those managed by laparoscopic approach. Recurrence reduces significantly when the procedure is done by a skilled experienced pediatric surgeon or pediatric urologist, or if it is a scheduled surgery.\n\nRecurrent inguinal hernia in children may include:\n\n\n  A missed hernial sac or unrecognized peritoneal tear.\n  Foul ligation of the sac.\n  Failure to repair a large internal inguinal ring.\n  Unrecognized defect of the floor of the inguinal canal (direct inguinal hernia).\n  Infection.\n  Increased intra-abdominal pressure (patients with ventricular-peritoneal shunts or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis).\n  Patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic cough.\n  Connective tissue disorders (i.e., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Literature for inguinal hernia has spanned more than 20 centuries. Galen in 176 A.D. firstly described the pathogenesis of indirect inguinal hernia as he depicted for the first time the “Processus Vaginalis Peritonei”.\n  The incidence of congenital indirect inguinal hernia in full-term neonates is 3.5–5%, while in preterm infants 9–11%.\n  Epidemiology: Mostly seen in males, with a male to female ratio ranging from 5:1 to 10:1.\n  Diagnosis of both inguinal hernia and hydrocele can be done by physical exam and confirmed without the strict use of images.\n  Treatment of inguinal hernia is always surgical. They can be approached by either an open inguinal herniorrhaphy (OIH) or a laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR).\n  Surgical treatment is usually ambulatory. Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, anemia, prematurity, or those who required ventilator support at the time of birth, should be observed after operative repair for at least 24 hours.\n  Follow-up should be done 1 week after surgery for early complications followed by clinical controls 1 month, 3 and 6 months post surgery.\n  Early complications after surgery may include local edema, hematoma, and wound infection.\n  Late complications seen post-surgery during follow-up include recurrent hydrocele or hernia, iatrogenic displacement of the testis, and testicular atrophy.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nPatent Processus Vaginalis (PV) leads to congenital hydrocele and inguinal hernia. Palpable mass in the groin should be evaluated for possible PV-associated conditions. Physical examination is the gold standard diagnostic method for these conditions. Treatment of inguinal hernia and communicating hydrocele with an associated hernia is always surgical. The success of surgical treatment depends on a high ligation of the sac as well as distal resection of it in hydroceles. Approaches include open inguinal herniorrhaphy as well as laparoscopic.\n\nComplications may be seen during surgery or at an early or late postoperative stage, which includes edema, hematoma or recurrent hydrocele, or hernia respectively. Several strategies are described by experts to avoid them. Follow-up should be done periodically for at least 6 months.\n\nOngoing controversies on the management of hernia and hydrocele still exist, especially when it comes to surgical technique based on recurrence and complication rates, aiming for minimally invasive procedures with better outcomes.\n\nReferences\n\n\nGearhart JP, Rink RC, Mouriqand PDE, editors.

        "title": "Varicocele",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nVaricocele is defined as an abnormal dilation of the pampiniform plexus which may cause pain, an atypical appearance, or impair fertility. These occur in approximately 15% of males, usually first appearing in adolescence, and are overrepresented in the sub-fertile population (approximately 35–49% of sub-fertile males).1 As per all varicose veins, the primary pathophysiology relates to incompetent venous valves, which are not able to force the blood back to the major vessels against gravity.2 Testicular veins are at risk due to their length, with the left vein more so due to its higher insertion at almost 90˚ and insertion at right angle into the left renal vein.3\n\nTherefore, the vast majority of unilateral varicoceles occur on the left hemiscrotum, and historically, right sided varicoceles have been a hallmark of a large renal mass.\n\nThe association with infertility was first described in 1952 by Tulloch. It has been shown that varicoceles result in a progressive and time dependent decline in testicular function, which may be arrested with varicocelectomy.4,5\n\nThe exact pathophysiological cause of infertility is not known, and it is likely multifactorial. Increased oxidative stress is commonly described, however, hyperthermia, hypoxia, and reflux of metabolites are also commonly cited contributing factors.\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nThe majority of varicoceles in adolescents are identified incidentally by the patient or a primary care practitioner. Evaluation of a varicocele should include examination with the patient in both a supine and standing position. Visually inspect the scrotum for any signs of swelling and palpate the spermatic cord both at rest and during Valsalva maneuver.\n\nSeverity of varicoceles are measured on a grade 0 (subclinical, detected on ultrasound only) to grade 3 scale (Table 1).6 It is important to assess if there is a significant difference in testicular size, as this may be a surrogate for impaired spermatogenesis, and can be an indication for surgical intervention.7,8 Ipsilateral testicular hypotrophy is often associated with varicoceles, with rates as high as 80% with grade 3 varicoceles.9 The most sensitive assessment of testicular volume is scrotal ultrasound, common formulas used to calculate testicular volume include the Lambert formula (volume = length × width × height × 0.71) and the ellipsoid formula (volume = length × width × height × 0.52). A significant difference in testicular volume is calculated as a 10–20% difference or 2 to 3 mL difference in size for more than 6–12 month, especially in prepubertal patients.\n\nManagement: Surgical Intervention Versus Observation\n\nThe decision to treat adolescents with varicoceles remains controversial, as there is no significant evidence or longitudinal studies demonstrating a significant correlation between adolescent varicoceles and future fertility. Chu et al followed over 200 adolescent males with asymptomatic varicoceles for a median of three years with serial examinations and demonstrated that 2/3 developed normal semen parameters without surgical intervention.10 An analysis in 2013 looked at the proteomic profile in adolescents with and without varicoceles with both normal and abnormal semen parameters, and did not find a difference.11 This is in keeping with current European and American guidelines which advise serial examinations or scrotal ultrasounds for male adolescents with varicoceles who are currently asymptomatic and have no evidence of testicular hypotrophy.7,12\n\nRelative indications for surgical repair of adolescent varicoceles include 1) high grade varicocele, 2) hypotrophic left testicle, 3) pain, and 4) abnormal semen parameters. Using abnormal semen parameters is most reliable in boys who are in Tanner stage V of puberty or are at least 18 years of age.7,8,10\n\nVaricoceles and Fertility\n\nOne of the primary concerns parents have when their child is diagnosed with a varicocele, is the effect it may have on the boy’s future fertility. When examining infertility rates in adult males, the incidence of varicoceles in infertile males is as high as 50%. Recent studies have demonstrated that there are significantly higher rates of pregnancy amongst couples if men with clinical varicoceles undergo any method of surgical repair (42% pregnancy rate) as opposed to no surgical repair (17% pregnancy rate), but many studies have been less conclusive, including meta-analyses and Cochrane review.12,13,14,15,16 Additionally, the improvement of sperm motility and sperm concentrations in adults who undergo repair of their varicocele, has a more significant effect the higher the varicocele grade. Asafu-Adjei et al reviewed over 2000 men with abnormal semen parameters who underwent surgical repair of their varicocele. The mean improvement in sperm motility post-repair increased with each varicocele grade; with a 10% improvement in grade 1 varicoceles, and an 18% improvement in grade 3 varicoceles. Additionally, mean sperm concentrations improved by 5.5 million in grade 1 varicoceles, and by 16 million in grade 3 varicoceles.17\n\nThe adolescent decision making algorithm can be considered more complex, as the vast majority will not be attempting conception. Therefore, definitive indications for repair are lacking. Furthermore, it is difficult to assess sperm parameters in adolescents, as there are no semen quality standards based on Tanner stage and age. Furthermore, some cultures will not support semen collection. Asymmetry in testicular size can be used as a surrogate for function, but differential growth will often result in spontaneous equalization of their sizes. Additionally, when reviewing studies and trials examining sperm parameters in adolescents with varicoceles, there is significant heterogeneity present in the studies and follow up times are not long enough to determine any significant effect on future paternity. If adolescents do fit within the parameters for surgical repair as per current guidelines, the success rates are very high regardless of surgical technique. Silay et al concluded that success rates (disappearance of varicocele) ranged from 87–100% with testicular catch-up growth seen in 86–100% of patients. No surgical repair technique was superior, and the most common complication observed was formation of a hydrocele at rates of 0–12%.14\n\nTable 1 Varicocele grading system1\n\n\n  \n    \n      Varicocele Grade\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Only detected on ultrasound, not palpable\n    \n    \n      1\n      Palpable only when standing and performing Valsalva\n    \n    \n      2\n      Palpable with patient standing without performing Valsalva\n    \n    \n      3\n      Visible when standing\n    \n  \n\n\nIndications for Intervention\n\nIn the pediatric population, the vast majority of varicoceles can be observed and managed conservatively until an indication to intervene occurs. These indications include unilateral testicular hypotrophy &gt;20% which persists over several (&gt;3 examinations), bilateral testicular hypotrophy, significant symptoms, or abnormal semen analysis. Pain attributable to varicoceles is classically dull and achy in nature and occurs with prolonged periods of standing. Adolescents often have vague, chronic testicular pain, but this is usually readily differentiated from the varicocele. With many technical and technological advancements in the field since the first historical treatments, a variety of approaches currently exist for the surgical management of varicoceles.18\n\nRepair Techniques\n\nEndovascular Varicocelectomy\n\nThe radiographic endovascular technique is one approach which may be performed under local anesthetic and endovascular access is obtained with a small incision over the femoral vein. Occlusion of the internal spermatic vein and associated collateral vessels is performed with multiple coils or balloon occlusion.19 The reported success rates in contemporary literature range from 90–97% with a recurrence rate of 2–24%.20,21,22 Possible complications include hydrocele formation, inguinal hematoma, femoral vein thrombosis, and contrast allergy.23,24,25 Additionally, rare complications include coil migration into the heart and pulmonary vessels.26,27\n\nLaparoscopic Varicocelectomy\n\nLaparoscopy allows for excellent visualization of anatomic structures. This approach can be especially useful in experienced hands in a patient with bilateral varicoceles. Various port placement configurations have been described, however a supraumbilical camera, with the ipsilateral port -lateral to the epigastric vessels, and the other in the midline between the umbilicus and the pubic symphysis. Once access is gained and pneumoperitoneum is achieved, the spermatic cord is identified at the internal inguinal ring and then the spermatic veins can be isolated and ligated individually, or mass ligation (Palomo technique) of artery, lymph, and veins can be performed.28\n\nSuccess rates of 85–100% have been reported.14 Recurrence rates ranging from 2.9% up to 17% have been described with additional possible complications consistent with laparoscopic surgery including injury to bowel, vessels, or other intra-abdominal structures, intra-abdominal infection, and air embolism.29,30,31,32 Reported rates of post-operative hydrocele formation range from 0–29% in contemporary literature.14 In order to minimize these rates, ligation of the testicular artery with preservation of lymphatics has been proposed with sufficient collateral arterial blood supply to preserve the teste via the cremasteric and deferential arteries.33\n\nInguinal Varicocelectomy\n\nThe traditional open inguinal or sub-inguinal approaches to varicocelectomy offer the advantages of greater experience and familiarity for most surgeons. The primary difference is the location of the ligation, which will either require opening the external oblique aponeurosis or performing the ligation just distal to the external ring, which may be less morbid. The inguinal approach exhibits a similar rate of success, recurrence, and hydrocele to the laparoscopic approach.14,18,32,34\n\nIn patients with significant prior inguinal surgery, a sub-inguinal approach may be advantageous by avoiding any significant scarring and adhesions that may be present. Significantly more vein branches and plexus are usually encountered more distally, however, and this can make the process of dissection and ligation more involved with arterial identification for preservation also being potentially more difficult.18\n\nMicrosurgical approaches offer high rates of success with a reported failure rate of 0.5–1% in appropriately trained hands, This approach requires more surgical time and requires highly specialized resources and training not present at all centers. However, it can minimize the risk of hydrocele formation by preserving lymphatics, and may have better improvements in improved sperm count and motility when compared to other approaches.14,18,32\n\nRetroperitoneal Varicocelectomy\n\nThrough an open retroperitoneal approach, an incision is made at the level of the internal inguinal ring. The external and internal obliques are split which allows for retroperitoneal exposure of the internal spermatic vein near the ureter.35 This approach requires the ligation of the fewest number of veins, however, it does incur a higher risk of varicocele recurrence estimated at 15–30% in the setting of more distal collateral vessels, and a risk of postoperative hydrocele in up to 30% of cases. As with other approaches, by intentionally ligating the testicular artery and the network of periarterial veins, recurrence rates can be reduced.\n\nNon-Operative Management\n\nFor the patients who choose not to undergo surgery, some follow up is required. Although no guidelines exist, Kolon et al recommend every 6–12-month clinical evaluation with semenanalysis through adulthood, although the manuscript admits this is required for long-term population data, and probably won’t affect individual outcomes. My personal practice is to assess with a history, physical exam, and ultrasound every 1–2 years until the age of 18 years.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Varicoceles are common, many are asymptomatic, and mostly occur on the left side\n  Reasons for intervention include chronic pain, persistent size discrepancy, or fertility concerns\n  There are many different techniques for repair, each with pros and cons\n\n\nConclusions\n\nVaricoceles in the pediatric and adolescent population are relatively common, but management can be controversial. Surgery for unsatisfactory appearance is straightforward, and assuming the pain has been appropriately vetted, usually successful. However, the benefits of performing surgery to improve semenanalysis or to prevent fertility problems is harder to demonstrate. Therefore, upon making the diagnosis, the surgeon must weigh all indications and options to ensure successful results.\n\nReferences\n\n\nDubin L, Amelar RD.

        "title": "Distal Hypospadias",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nIn the ancient Greek literature, Aristotle was the first to describe the urinary dysfunction resulting from a penile malformation.1 The Greek physician Galen is credited for coining the term hypospadias in the 100s A.D.1 As its early describers, the etymology of the term hypospadias is Greek, deriving from the roots hypo (under) and spadon (rent, fissure).\n\nHypospadias is one of the most common congenital anomalies in newborn males. It is characterized by ventral placement of the urethral opening with arrested development of the ventral penis, urethra, and foreskin.2 Due to this arrested development, there is incomplete urethral tubularization, which results in an ectopic urethral opening on the ventral aspect of the penis. Depending on the severity, hypospadias is often associated with ventral chordee (penile curvature) and ventral foreskin deficiency, resulting in a “dorsal hooded” prepuce. The anatomic location of the urethral orifice is typically used for classification of hypospadias. The hypospadic meatus can be located anywhere from the glans to the perineum. About 50% of hypospadias are distal (glans, coronal, and subcoronal), 30% are middle (penile shaft), and 20% are proximal (penoscrotal, scrotal, and perineal) (Figure 1).3,4 This chapter will focus on the embryology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, evaluation, repair, follow-up, and complications of distal hypospadias. Proximal hypospadias is considered a more severe presentation and will be covered in another chapter.\n\n\nFigure 1 Spectrum of hypospadias presentations.4\n\nEmbryology\n\nDevelopment of the external male genitalia begins in an ambisexual stage during the fifth gestational week.5 Until the seventh and eighth weeks, the genital tubercle, urogenital fold, and labioscrotal folds are identical.5,6 Sexual differentiation begins during gestational weeks 8 and 9 when expression of the SRY gene initiates male gonadal differentiation, and thereby the production of androgens.5 However, penile development occurs through both androgen-independent and androgen-dependent events.7,8 Androgen-independent events are common to both males and females and include the formation of the genital tubercle, urethral plate, urethral groove, glans, prepuce, and corporal body.7 Androgen-dependent events include urethral tubularization, circumferential foreskin development, and penile elongation.6,7,8\n\nThe male urethra develops through a “double zipper” mechanism beginning in week 8 of gestation.9,10 In this process, the initial opening zipper involves distal canalization of the urethral plate to form the urethral groove. A closing zipper follows in proximal to distal fashion, as the medial edges of the endodermal urethral folds fuse together to form a tubular urethra. The zipper continues to move distally until the urethral meatus is at the glanular tip. This process, along with the circumferential development of foreskin, is driven through androgenic stimulation and is typically complete by week 17 of gestation.7,8\n\nDisruption in this embryologic process causes a failure in proper urethral fold fusion, resulting in a urethral opening on the ventral aspect of the penis.11 Additionally, a disruption prevents the foreskin from developing circumferentially, which presents as a dorsal hooded prepuce in hypospadias.12\n\nEpidemiology\n\nHypospadias is one of the most common congenital anomalies in males, occurring in about 1:200-300 live births in the US, 1:500 throughout Europe, and 1:2,000-3,000 throughout Asia.5,10,13 Though the incidence of hypospadias varies throughout the world, multiple database studies showed a drastic increase in incidence in recent history. There was a doubling in rate (0.2 to 0.4 percent) in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s.14 This increase is unlikely due to improvements in detection, as there was a disproportional increase in severe cases compared to more mild cases. Rather, multifactorial influences such as endocrine disruption, environmental exposures, and genetic predisposition may contribute to this increased rate.11,15 Other population surveys also found drastic increases in the hypospadias incidence during the late 20th century, including studies of Canada, Australia, England, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Japan, and Italy, among others.3,16 A database study from Washington found that advanced maternal age (&gt;40 years old), preexisting maternal diabetes, and white race were each independently associated with increased risk of having a newborn with hypospadias.15\n\nEtiology/Pathogenesis\n\nThe pathogenesis of hypospadias is likely due to disruption of androgen metabolism and response during gestation, as androgenic stimulation is responsible for key processes in penile development.6,7,8 These disruptions are likely multifactorial, originating from both genetic predisposition and environmental exposures.17\n\nGenetic\n\nSupporting evidence for a genetic predisposition is through the family clustering reported in hypospadias, as about 7% of affected patients have an additional 1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree family member also affected, especially with the “anterior” or distal type.18 A family history positive for hypospadias was also reported for almost a quarter of boys with hypospadias.19 Paternal history of hypospadias was present in about 31% of affected boys.19\n\nGenes that have been associated with increased risk of hypospadias are related to defects in their androgenic hormonal balance during development. Specifically, genes that affect androgen metabolizing enzymes, androgen receptors, and estrogen receptors.20,21,22,23,24,25,26 For example, the expression of androgen receptors and 5 alpha-reductase type 2 have been localized to ventral urethral epithelium and stroma, respectively, during development.26 Defects in their activity may lead to abnormal urethral remodeling and result in hypospadias.26 Some congenital anomaly syndromes that may also present with hypospadias include WAGR, Denys-Drash, Smith-Lemli-Opitz, Opitz G, and Frasier syndromes, among nearly 200 others.5,18,27\n\nEnvironmental\n\nThere is a two-hit hypothesis regarding the development of hypospadias, in which environmental exposure to endocrine disruptors may potentiate the effects of genetic predisposition to hypospadias.17 Some of the identified exposures that may increase risk of hypospadias include maternal pregnancy-related progestin intake, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (flame retardants), maternal smoking, paternal prescription drug use, maternal diethylstilbestrol exposure, maternal iron supplementation, and paternal exposure to pesticides.28,29,30 Of these, only maternal progestin intake, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, maternal smoking, and paternal prescription drug use have been shown to be statistically significant in studies.\n\nDiagnosis and Evaluation\n\nHypospadias should be diagnosed at birth during a thorough neonatal physical examination. Performing a neonatal circumcision is contraindicated in these patients because the prepuce is often interposed during the urethral reconstruction, whether as a vascularized flap or free graft. Therefore, establishing a diagnosis during the neonatal period is essential to prevent removing the available and useful preputial tissue with a circumcision. A thorough genitourinary examination of a patient with hypospadias would show two urethral openings: 1) a blind-ending urethral pit at the normal glanular location and 2) an opening of the true urethral meatus on the ventral aspect of the penis (Figure 2). Other classic characteristics associated with hypospadias that may or may not be present include a dorsal hooded prepuce as a result of ventral foreskin deficiency and ventral chordee, or penile curvature. Once the diagnosis is established, the physician should further evaluate the patient for other associated congenital anomalies related to syndromic causes.31 However, approximately 90% of cases are isolated hypospadias.31 The presence of both bilateral cryptorchidism and hypospadias is suggestive of a disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD), though this is considered more common in boys with proximal hypospadias.32 Regardless, any patient with hypospadias and bilateral cryptorchidism should be evaluated with a karyotype, pelvic ultrasound, and serum electrolytes to screen for salt-wasting secondary to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).\n\nDuring urologic consultation, several factors should be considered when contemplating repair. A thorough genitourinary examination by an experienced pediatric urologist should be conducted to determine the meatal location, glans volume, penile length, degree of chordee, presence of penoscrotal transposition, and depth and width of the urethral plate. Urinary tract imaging is neither indicated nor necessary for isolated hypospadias.31 These operative characteristics, in addition to a surgeon’s preference and experience, play a role in planning for repair. Last, the risks and benefits of surgery should be discussed thoroughly with the parents to allow for shared-decision making.\n\n\nFigure 2 (A) Ventral chordee with a dorsal hooded prepuce. (B) Ventral chordee. (C &amp; D) Sub-coronal hypospadias with a dorsal hooded prepuce.\n\nPreoperative Planning and Management\n\nFor most distal hypospadias, surgical repair is not required, especially in glanular hypospadias where the urine stream is straight. Many of these boys have normal voiding and future sexual function of their penis. The “normal” meatal location is widely considered as the distal tip of the glans. Great variation of meatal location has been reported with preservation of sexual and voiding function throughout adulthood in men with untreated hypospadias.33,34 A survey found that men with untreated “milder” or distal hypospadias report difficulties with sexual intercourse associated to curvature, but no significant urinary issues compared to normal men.35 This suggests that distal hypospadias repair should focus on chordee correction and avoid urethroplasty and its associated complications.43 Additionally, infertility is considered to be an issue in proximal hypospadias, not distal.34 However, patients with coronal and mid-penile hypospadias may have urinary spraying or deflection of the urine stream that lead them to sit down to void, or cosmetic issues that cause future psychosexual implications. As such, many parents elect for surgical repair of their child’s distal hypospadias.\n\nAs for timing of the surgery, most pediatric urologists agree that repair can be performed starting at 6 months of age. This coincides with the 1996 guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics Section of Urology action committee, who report 6–12 months as an acceptable age for hypospadias repair.44 When opting for multi-stage procedures, though this is uncommon in distal hypospadias, 6 months is recommended between procedures to allow for proper wound healing. Notably, efforts should be made to limit a child’s time under anesthesia, as emerging literature express concern for the effect of prolonged anesthesia on brain development in children under 3 years old.36\n\nThere is debate among pediatric urologists over the use of preoperative androgen stimulation in boys with hypospadias. Many urologists advocate for its use in boys with severe hypospadias in order to increase phallus length, glans circumference, penile vascularity, and tissue robustness to optimize penile characteristics for repair. However, a systematic review suggests that preoperative hormonal stimulation is associated with increased postoperative complication rates in patients with proximal hypospadias, though it did not reach statistical significance.37 When deemed necessary, we use two doses of 25 mg intramuscular depo-testosterone injections with a six-week interval between doses.\n\nAntibiotic and Analgesic Prophylaxis\n\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is commonly used among pediatric urologists in an effort to minimize the risk of surgical site and urinary tract infections, especially in stented repairs.38 However, concerns over increased rates of antibiotic resistance have raised questions regarding the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis. Retrospective studies have found no significant difference in surgical site and urinary tract infections with and without the use of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in hypospadias repair.39,40 However, additional studies with larger sample sizes would be helpful in further clarifying the effectiveness of this practice. At our institution, we use cefazolin (30 mg/kg) intravenously as preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis upon anesthesia induction. As for postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, a reported 91% of pediatric urologists prescribe postoperative antibiotics when a urethral catheter is left in place.38 However, a recent meta-analysis assessing the effects of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis after hypospadias repair found limited utility in preventing infectious and wound healing complications, although the risk of bias was high in many of the studies.41 There is currently an ongoing international, multi-institution, randomized controlled trial assessing post-operative prophylaxis.42 At our institution, we prescribe oral TMP-SMX 2 mg/kg daily for the duration of the catheter.\n\nProviding patients with adequate analgesia is especially important in this population since many boys that undergo hypospadias repair are too young to verbally communicate. Various analgesic techniques are used in hypospadias repair including caudal block and peripheral nerve blocks (dorsal nerve penile block and pudendal nerve block). There is ongoing debate over the efficacy of these different techniques and their effects on postoperative outcomes. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing caudal vs peripheral nerve blocks reports no significant difference in additional analgesic use within 24 hours of surgery, but lower pain scores 24 hours after the surgery with a caudal block.43 The authors also report no additional risk of postoperative complications with caudal blocks.43 On the contrary, a different meta-analysis found a significant association between caudal block analgesia and postoperative complications following hypospadias repair, although these data were likely confounded by hypospadias severity.44 Additional clarifying data is needed to determine the most effective and safest analgesic technique. At our institution, the surgeon prefers a preoperative caudal block for pain control.\n\nDistal Hypospadias Repair\n\nHypospadias repair should aim to achieve the following three main objectives: ability to comfortably void in an upright position, an appropriate voiding stream, and “normal” penile appearance and function.45 Though there is normal variation in penile appearance, the typical goal is to create a vertical, slit-like meatus at the distal glanular tip.46 Most, if not all, distal hypospadias repair can accomplish these objectives when using the tubularized incised plate (TIP) repair.47,48 The original Thiersch-Duplay repair technique was complemented and popularized by the TIP technique first described by Snodgrass in 1994.47,49 His modification consisted of a deep longitudinal midline incision of the dorsal urethral plate, which allows for widening of the urethral plate to facilitate tubularization. These are the steps performed at our institution, which is a variation of the TIP technique (Recommended Video, (Figure 3), and (Figure 4)50,51\n\n\n  Insert 5-Fr feeding tube across the hypospadic meatus, place stay sutures on both sides of the future distal meatus, and place the penile tourniquet.\n  Create vertical incisions on each edge of the urethral plate, then a crossing incision proximal to the meatus connecting the two.\n  Separate the glans flap and make a dorsal midline incision of the urethral plate.\n  Urethroplasty is performed using 6-0 PDS suture for a one-layer subepithelial closure with continuous sutures over the 5-French feeding tube.\n  A lateral dartos flap is harvested and used to cover the suture line.\n  Glansplasty is completed by ventrally re-approximating the glans flaps.\n  Deglove the penis to the base.\n  Circumcise the excess preputial skin and measure the degree of chordee.\n  Re-approximate the ventral penile shaft skin.\n  Secure the feeding tube to the glans and apply a thin, compressive, waterproof, and sterile hydrocolloid film followed by a transparent, thin, waterproof, and sterile adhesive wrap dressing to keep the penis elevated (Figure 3)\n\n\n\nFigure 3 (A) Inserting 5-Fr feeding tube across the hypospadic meatus, placing stay sutures on both sides of the future distal meatus, and placing the penile tourniquet.

(F) Re-approximation of ventral skin after degloving and circumcision.\n\nThe tubularized incised plate technique is widely accepted as the method of choice for distal hypospadias repair. Hypospadias repair at our institution are performed using a variation of the TIP technique, in which the dartos flap is harvested from the lateral rather than dorsal aspect of the penis, as this is our preferred method. Other techniques such as the Mathieu procedure, Duckett onlay island flap repair, and MAGPI are also options. However, the TIP approach has been consistently reported to have low complication rates, especially among high volume surgeons.52,53 In addition to low complication rates, cosmetic results after TIP have been assessed and rated better when compared to the Mathieu and Duckett onlay island flap repairs.46 The favorable cosmesis of the TIP approach is attributed to the creation of a vertical slit-like urethral orifice, as opposed to a circular urethral orifice with the Mathieu procedure. There is also variation in urethroplasty suture techniques within the TIP procedure, which may be performed using either interrupted- or continuous-sutures. Comparative studies of interrupted vs continuous-suture urethroplasty techniques in distal hypospadias repair found no significant difference in complication rates, therefore leaving the choice to surgeon preference.48,54\n\nRecommended Video\n\n\n  Distal hypospadias repair\n\n\nPost-Operative Care and Follow-Up\n\nHypospadias repair at our institution is performed as an outpatient procedure and patients are discharged the same day. We catheterize all our patients with a soft 5-French feeding tube and secure it to the glans with a stay suture, which stays in place for 5–7 days. There is question whether hypospadias repair should be performed stented, as it is classically done for urinary diversion, or non-stented, to prevent bladder spasm and stent removal discomfort. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies compared early (bladder spasm, dysuria, UTI, stent failure, urine extravasation, bleeding, urinary retention, et cetera) and late (meatal stenosis, stricture, fistula, diverticulum, glans dehiscence, and other reoperation rates) complication rates after stented vs non-stented distal hypospadias TIP repair.55 There were no significant differences in either early or late complication rates between stented and non-stented TIP repairs in the overall meta-analysis and RCT pool, however the evidence was deemed to be of low-moderate quality. Further RCTs are needed to truly determine its impact in distal hypospadias repair.\n\nDressing is often used to optimize postoperative healing by promoting immobilization, surgical site protection, tissue adherence, and compression.56 Currently, there is no consensus on the most effective dressing type, or whether applying a dressing is beneficial at all. A randomized trial found no significant difference in complication rates or clinical outcomes when comparing dressed and non-dressed patients following hypospadias repair.56 Of note, there were significantly increased postoperative calls by parents in the non-dressed group. We apply a compressive hydrocolloid dressing followed by an adhesive wrap that keeps the penis elevated to minimize edema. In the case of pretoilet-trained patients, we recommend double diapers while the catheter is in place. We make a hole in the inner diaper to allow the catheter to pass through and drain into the outer diaper. The catheter and dressing are removed at the patient’s first post-operative follow-up visit after 5–7 days. If the patient is toilet-trained, either we keep the feeding tube and drain into pull-ups or use a suprapubic catheter for urine drainage, but never place a Foley catheter. We prescribe oral TMP-SMX 2 mg/kg daily for the duration of the catheter. We also prescribe oxybutynin 0.2 mg/kg twice daily until the catheter is removed to prevent bladder spasms.\n\nThe preoperative caudal nerve block helps ameliorate postoperative pain. Further pain control is generally achieved with low doses of NSAID analgesics. While there is variation in opioid prescription for children after hypospadias repair, pediatric urologists are trending away from this practice. A quality improvement initiative using education and a predetermined non-opioid pain regimen was successful in reducing opioid prescriptions following hypospadias repair.57 They found equivalent pain and function outcomes using alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen, suggesting opioids may be safely omitted while still achieving adequate postoperative pain control.57 None of our patients receive opioids, as we aim to minimize opioid exposure in children.\n\nOur post-operative follow-up schedule is to return to clinic at one week (for dressing removal), and then again at one, three, six, and twelve months Patients are also scheduled to return to clinic at least once after toilet training. We emphasize the importance of post-operative follow-up to the parents in order to optimize outcomes and patient satisfaction, especially since complications may present many years after repair.58\n\nComplications\n\nA majority of patients that undergo distal hypospadias repair have successful surgical outcomes. However, some patients may develop post-operative complications that warrant re-intervention. Early complications that can occur include bleeding, infection, dehiscence, catheter dislodgment, and urinary obstruction. Later complications that may develop are urethrocutaneous fistula, meatal stenosis, glans dehiscence, neourethral stricture, urethral diverticulum, and balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO).50\n\nA systematic review comprising of 1872 patients who underwent distal hypospadias repair using the TIP technique in 15 case series found a urethrocutaneous fistula rate of 3.8%, meatal stenosis rate of 3.1%, and neourethral stricture rate of 0%.59 Another systematic review of 624 patients that underwent distal hypospadias repair using the TIP technique in 16 studies found a urethrocutaneous fistula rate of 11.1%, meatal stenosis rate of 6.7%, and dehiscence rate of 4.2%.60 Complications such as these often require surgical re-intervention in order to prevent worsening severity of the issue. Notably, primary distal repairs have lower rates of re-operation when compared to secondary and primary proximal repairs.61 When planning for re-operation, it is important to wait at least 6 months from the initial operation to allow for proper tissue healing.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Hypospadias is one of the most common congenital anomalies in newborn males, occurring in about 1:200-300 live births.\n  Disrupted urethral fold fusion results in the urethral opening being located on the ventral aspect of the penis.\n  Two-hit hypothesis: environmental exposure to endocrine disruptors potentiate the effects of genetic predisposition to hypospadias.\n  Two urethral openings on examination: 1) a blind-ending urethral pit at the normal glanular location and 2) an opening of the true urethral meatus on the ventral aspect of the penis.\n  Other classic characteristics associated with hypospadias include a dorsal hooded prepuce and ventral chordee.\n  Hypospadias repair may be performed starting at 6 months of age.\n  The tubularized incised plate (TIP) technique is widely accepted as the method of choice for distal hypospadias repair.\n  The most common complications from hypospadias repair include urethrocutaneous fistula, meatal stenosis, glans dehiscence, and neourethral stricture, though rates are low for distal repair.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nHypospadias is one of the most common congenital anomalies in newborn males. It is due to arrested penile development that results in failure of proper urethral fold fusion. Hypospadias is attributed to a multifactorial etiology that derives from genetic predisposition and environmental exposures. A thorough history and examination should be performed to adequately establish a diagnosis of hypospadias and evaluate the patient’s risk characteristics. Surgical repair can be performed as early as 6 months of age and is typically done using the tubularized incised plate technique. Though distal hypospadias repair is consistently reported to have excellent outcomes, long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for complications and ensure patient satisfaction.\n\nResources for Patients\n\n\n  Hypospadias &amp; Epispadias Association\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  HJR H, LL W.

        "title": "Proximal Hypospadias",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nHypospadias is defined as an opening of the urethral meatus on the ventral aspect of the penile shaft proximal to the tip of the glans penis. As mentioned in the previous chapter, hypospadias is classified according to the location of the urethral meatus as distal, middle, and proximal. The posterior (severe) variety, which accounts for 20% of the cases, extends through the proximal third of the penile shaft to the perineum. It may further be sub-classified as posterior penile (at the base of the shaft), penoscrotal (at the base of the shaft in front of the scrotum), scrotal (on the scrotum or in between the genital swellings) or the most severe variety, the perineal (behind the scrotum and behind the genital swellings, Figure 1).1 Although the classification of hypospadias, to distal, mid shaft and proximal has been historically based on meatal location preoperatively, the correct classification is best done at the time of surgery, since meatal location may change based on hypoplastic urethral more proximally. The severe hypospadias is often associated with ventral curvature of the penis known as chordee, a “hooded” or incomplete prepuce, and an abortive corpora spongiosum. Hypospadiology, a term coined by John W. Duckett, Jr., is the study of all aspects of this condition and encompasses a continuously evolving and expanding discipline.2 The incidence of hypospadias is about 1:200–300 live births in the US.3,4 The recent increase in incidence can be attributed to prematurity, small-for-gestational age infants, low birth weight and maternal age of 35 years or older.1\n\n\nFigure 1 Spectrum of hypospadias presentations.\n\nEmbryology\n\nThe male external genitalia progressively develops recognisable characteristics by the 3rd month of gestation. Normally, the urogenital sinus opening extends to the ventral aspect of the genital tubercle as the urethral groove. The primitive urogenital orifice and the urethral groove are bound on either side by the urethral folds.5 The genital tubercle becomes elongated to form the phallus, and the urethral folds start to fuse from the urogenital orifice towards the tip of the phallus, which results in the formation of the penile urethra by the end of the 14th week. The corpora cavernosa appear as paired mesenchymal columns within the shaft of the penis in the 7th week. The corpora spongiosa results from the differentiation of the mesenchymal masses around the penile urethra.5 In cases of proximal hypospadias, it is believed that there is failure of these urethral folds to fuse. Due to the arrest in the tubularisation, there is differential growth of the penis on the ventral as compared to the dorsal aspect.\n\nAn understanding of the anatomy of the penis will greatly aid in understanding the repair of hypospadias (Figure 2).\n\n \nFigure 2 The layers of the penis in a normal adult.6\n\nSevere Hypospadias and Other Associated Genitourinary Conditions\n\nDue to common embryopathy, proximal hypospadias is more often associated with other congenital conditions namely cryptorchoidism in 10% of cases,7 inguinal hernia in up to 32% of boys,8 disorders of sexual development in up to 27.3%9 and prostatic utricle.\n\nIn the presence of severe hypospadias and a nonpalpable testes, DSD must be ruled out.10 In these cases, obtaining a karyotype is a must. Scrotal hypospadias alone should raise suspicion about disorder of sex development, more so when it is associated with bilateral cryporchoidism.11 Ambiguous genitalia is suspected in patients of hypospadias with impalpable gonads; hypospadias with micropenis and either one or no palpable gonads; new born with female external genitalia and a gonadal mass in the labia or labial fusion and/or clitoral enlargement.12\n\nEvaluation\n\nTable 1 Points to note while evaluating a case of hypospadias.6\n\n\n  \n    \n      History\n      Additional History\n      Examination\n      Additional examination\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      age, reared as male\n      h/o voice change, breast development\n      stretched phallic length\n      habitus (masculine or feminine)\n    \n    \n      h/o passing urine from under surface of penis\n      h/o maternal intake of hormones during pregnancy\n      chordee (absent/mild &lt;30˚/severe &gt;30˚)\n      breast development (Tanner’s staging)\n    \n    \n      ventral curvature of penis\n      family history of hypospadias\n      meatus (stenotic/ not stenotic)\n      axillary Hair (present or absent, development of male or female type)\n    \n    \n      urinary stream deviated from midline or narrow\n      h/o repeated fetal loss or acute illness and vomiting in neonatal period\n      meatal location (glandular/coronal/distal penile/mid penile/proximal penile/penoscrotal/scrotal)\n      pubic hair (present or absent, development of male or female type)\n    \n    \n      h/o genital surgery\n       \n      glans (rounded/conical)\n      ambiguity of external genitalia (Prader’s staging in a case of DSD)\n    \n    \n      undescended testis\n       \n      urethral groove (shallow/deep)\n       \n    \n    \n      h/o erections and curvature in an older adolescent child\n       \n      urethral plate (wide/narrow/scarred/supple)\n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n      prepuce (dorsal hooded/adequate for reconstruction/absent)\n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n      testes location\n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n      testes size\n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n      scrotum (well developed/penoscrotal transposition/hypoplastic/penoscrotal webbing)\n       \n    \n  \n\n\nIn addition, the GMS (Glans, Meatus, and Shaft) score appears to correlate with the risk of a surgical complications. The GMS score is based on the glans size/urethral plate quality, location of meatus, and degree of chordee. Arlen et al demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of any postoperative complication with every unit increase in total GMS score Table 2.13 In their study, 262 boys (mean age 12.3 ± 13.7 months) underwent primary hypospadias repair had a mean GMS score of 7 ± 2.5 (G 2.1 ± 0.9, M 2.4 ± 1, S 2.4 ± 1) and a mean clinical follow-up of 17.7 ± 9.3 months. They found 37 boys developed 45 complications. A significant relationship between the total GMS score and the presence of any complication (p &lt; 0.001) was observed; for every unit increase in GMS score the odds of any postoperative complication increased 1.44 times (95% CI, 1.24–1.68).13 The development of a urethrocutaneuous fistula was observed in 21 of 239 (8.8%) of single-stage repairs and was the most common complication. Those with mild (GMS 3–6), moderate (GMS 7–9) and severe (GMS 10–12) hypospadias had a 2.4% fistula, 11.1%, and 22.6% (p &lt; 0.001) fistula rate respectively. Also, the degree of chordee was observed to be an independent predictor of fistula on multivariate analysis. They found that patients with greater than 60° ventral curvature were 27 times more likely to develop a fistula than patients who had no curvature (95% CI, 3.2–229).13\n\nTable 2 The GMS score.13\n\n\n  \n    \n      Glans (G) Score\n      Meatus (M) Score\n      Shaft (S) Score\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1.

Severe (&gt; 60°) chordee\n    \n  \n\n\nThe assessment of the urethral plate is also important as a narrow urethral plate portends poorer prognosis (Figure 3). The two predominant factors that guide our decision on how to repair a proximal hypospadias are the quality of the urethral plate, and perhaps more importantly, the degree of ventral curvature present\n\n\nFigure 3 The width of the urethral plate decreases from a to c in the patients of proximal hypospadias.14\n\nInvestigations\n\nImaging\n\n\n  The ultrasound should be done in cases of proximal hypospadias to rule out associated renal anomalies although such anomalies are extremely rare.12 If there is a history of recurrent urinary tract infection, a Micturating cystourethrography should be performed. Also, in cases of true ambiguous genitalia, MCU can help to assess the presence of müllerian duct remnants. These patients are usually asymptomatic and do not require routine surgical resection of the remnants. Occasionally, resection of the utricle may be necessary because of recurrent urinary tract infection, urinary dribbling or stone formation.12 While operating in patients with proximal hypospadias, the prostatic utricle might sometimes prevent placement of the catheter into the bladder with the catheter preferentially lodging in the utricle itself. This can be taken care of by using any of the following methods i) the double catheter method in which the first catheter inadvertently enters in the prostatic utricle, then a smaller French catheter is inserted through the urethral meatus and that invariably enters into the urethra; ii) the Clutton sound for guiding the urethral catheter; iii) in difficult cases, cystoscopy aided soft guide wire can be first passed into the bladder and then an open ended catheter can be advanced over the wire to reach the bladder.15\n\n\nKaryotyping\n\nThe AUA cryptorchidism guideline recommends that all boys with unilateral or bilateral undescended testes and severe proximal hypospadias must undergo additional testing to rule out a disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD), which occurs much more frequently in these settings .9,10 Guidelines introduced in 2006 included severe hypospadias as a form of 46,XY DSD.16 The concern for DSD is particularly high in a boy with hypospadias and a nonpalpable testis. Kaefer et al.10 examined 79 patients with a history of hypospadias and cryptorchidism. Those with a nonpalpable testis(es), either unilateral or bilateral, had a threefold increased risk of having an underlying DSD diagnosis identified (approximately 50% vs. 15%). There was a significantly increased risk of DSD with proximal hypospadias compared with distal hypospadias (64% vs. 7%) .10 A normal 46, XY karyotype may be misleading, particularly in boys with the most severe variants. The authors also prefer investigating such patients with severe hypospadias and UDT with Karyotyping.\n\nPreoperative Androgen\n\nThe preoperative use of DHT, or testosterone can be either by local application, or more frequently by intramuscular injection, can lead to an increase in penile length and width, and can cause an increase in glans size. In patients with micropenis, the testosterone has shown to be beneficial in stimulating the growth of the penis. The protocol of application may vary in different institutes. Local application of 2% testosterone propionate cream to the penis three times daily for 3 weeks is recommended.12 This route of testosterone administration is easy to apply, and shows good response. However, the response is variable depending upon the compliance of daily application and the amount of cream applied. Excess amount may lead to systemic absorption, deepening of voice and change in behaviour of boys in extreme cases. The application should be stopped at least a 3 week before the date of surgery. The intramuscular testosterone, 2mg/kg/dose total of three doses at 3 weeks interval, the last dose given at least 2 weeks prior to the date of surgery, is a more reliable route of administration.\n\nConsent for Surgery\n\nA fully informed written consent must be obtained after giving appropriate, enough, timely information about the planned procedure and the possible alternate procedures which would best apply to the individual case. Many times, the procedure may change depending upon the examination under anaesthesia and hence, the possibility of various surgical options should be informed to parent beforehand. A clear picture of the outcome, cosmetic results and possible complications (fistula formation, stricture or dehiscence) must be provided. In cases of proximal hypospadias, parents must understand that their child most probably requires a multistage repair. Thus, preparation of the family and patient for the proper procedure, accurate anatomic assessment, and an honest discussion about surgical outcomes and potential complications is necessary.7\n\nSurgical Timing\n\nThe timing of the primary elective repair is recommended to occur between the ages of 6 and 12 months by the American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP]7,17 based on studies that highlight the balance between the potential adverse psychological effects of surgery, the anesthetic risk to the child, the degree of penile development that will facilitate a successful repair, and wound healing differences as boys age.18 Belman et al showed that boys undergoing repair before 12 months of age, experienced less anxiety and had improved psychosexual outcomes compared with boys undergoing repair at older ages.19\n\nObjectives of Reconstruction\n\n\n  To enable voiding with normal velocity and laminar flow,\n  To obtain satisfactory sexual function with a straight penis, and\n  Achievement of a slit-like meatus with a well approximated glans, from a cosmetic stand point.20\n\n\nStages of Reconstruction\n\n\n  Correction of ventral curvature\n  Urethroplasty\n  Glansplasty\n  Skin coverage\n\n\nSurgical Repair Techniques\n\nIn proximal hypospadias, these are most often achieved by staged repair. There are two schools of thought regarding proximal hypospadias repair:\n\n\n  use of flaps\n  staged graft procedures\n\n\nThese are dependent on the correction of ventral curvature. On rare occasions, after skin degloving there is no further ventral chordee, and either Tubularised incised Plate (TIP) repair or Onlay island flap is used for urethroplasty, although the long TIP repair is less in favour, because of long-term complications. If there is left over chordee, some surgeons prefer the staged repair wherein, after dividing the urethral plate, they place a preputial graft, and if not available, a buccal mucosal graft (BMG) in the first stage and then tabularize the graft at the second stage. If after skin degloving there is still ventral curvature above 30 degrees, then correction of the chordee, either by Tunica vaginalis flap (TVF), or Tunica vaginalis graft (TVG), or SIS, or dermal, or by multiple transverse corprotomies as explained by Snodgrass21 is used in the first stage. Then urethroplasty is done in the second or third stage of repair, based on the technique for correcting the ventral chordee.\n\nIn short, if, after the skin degloving, there is Chordee&lt; 30, then there are 2 options: TIP repair (not preferred by most surgeons), and the dorsal only flap.\n\nIf the chordee is &gt; 30˚, then the Urethral plate (UP) is divided. Now if after division there is no chordee, we can use dorsal preputial flap as inlay or as tabularized (after Duckett) or we can use preputial or BMG graft.\n\nCorrection of Penile Ventral Curvature\n\nChordee Overview\n\nThe chordee correction is the most important initial step in the repair of proximal hypospadias, whether staged or single stage. In the first stage after degloving the penile skin, the degree of penile curvature is evaluated by artificial erection test. If the chordee is above 30 degrees, measured by ruler or goniometer (Figure 4), then next step would be to divide the urethral plate, which is mostly done at the distal end near the glans level. In this stage the ventral curvature is corrected, penoscrotal transposition is repaired, penile shaft skin is degloved and the urethral plate is divided to correct the curvature.\n\nMoscardi et al.22 pointed out that a high percentage of penile curvatures were resolved just by degloving the penis, the shortened ventral skin, and fibrotic ventral dartos. Braga et al.23 reviewed the resolution rate of the penile curvature after the dissection of the skin and the dartos fascia in 137 patients with hypospadias7 where 9 had mild (&lt;30°), 44 moderate (30–45°), and 85 had severe curvature (&gt;45°). The complete resolution rate of the curvature, after degloving the penis was 70% in the mild, 30% in the moderate, and 2.4% in the severe curvature group.23\n\n\nFigure 4 Management in patients with proximal penile hypospadias and chordee.22\n\nMeasurement of Degree of Chordee\n\nThe straightening of the penile shaft is measured using the test for artificial erection, i.e., Gittes and McLaughlin technique.24 In this test, saline is injected through a fine needle (25–27 gauge) into the lateral aspect of the corpora cavernosa or into the glans with a tourniquet at the base of the penis (Figure 5).\n\n\nFigure 5 Measurement of degree of penile curvature intra-operatively.\n\nHowever, in a high percentage of proximal hypospadias, after degloving, if an artificial erection shows more than 30 degrees of chordee, then the UP is divided at the distal end near the glans, and the proximal urethra is dissected to make the penis straight, improve the penile length and avoid retraction by the short and fibrotic urethral plate.22 The penile elongation techniques include execution of multiple transverse incisions on the ventral aspect of the tunica albuginea or, performing a single transverse incision and applying a graft or flap of tunica vaginalis, SIS graft, or dermis (Figure 6).\n\n\nFigure 6 Correction of penile curvature by corporotomy and using SIS graft to cover the raw area.\n\nResidual Chordee After Up Incision\n\nIn those cases where chordee still persists on the artificial erection test, after dividing the UP, there are two ways to deal with residual chordee, corporotomies i.e., making 3 transverse incisions ventrally, not very deep, without coverage by any graft, or the other way, that the authors also use, is to make one big transverse incision and then cover it by either dermal graft, SIS, TVG or TV FLAP (Figure 7).21\n\n\nFigure 7 (a) The artificial erection test demonstrating degree of chordee, (b) Multiple transverse corporotomies, (c) Straightening of the penile curvature on repeated testing. [From: An alternative for ventral lengthening in children with severe penile curvature that allows graft coverage during staged hypospadias repair. Bruno Leslie, Bryce Weber, Rodrigo Romao, Walid Farhat, Darius Bagli, Armando Lorenzo, Joao Pippi Salle. J Urol Vol 221, Pg 11, 2011]\n\nIn the first technique, three transverse corporotomies are performed ventrally, first at the point of maximal curvature from 4 o’clock to 8 o’clock, and two more 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the first, through the tunica albuginea till the erectile tissue is visible, and the test is then repeated. These corporotomies may be covered using the native proximal urethra, after proximal dissection, or covered by preputial graft or BMG.21,25\n\nSnodgrass performed a study on 43 boys with proximal hypospadias and ventral curvature 30 degrees or greater after degloving underwent transection of the urethral plate. Those patients with persistent ventral curvature 30 degrees or greater also underwent 3 ventral corporotomies without corporal grafting for straightening. Staged graft urethroplasty was performed using prepuce, or labial mucosa.21,25,26 They found that the mean ventral curvature was 70 degrees, and corporotomy was performed in 65% of them and the preputial grafts were used in 88%; the rest of the patients, the corporotomy was covered by dermal grafts. None of these patients were reported to have a recurrence of the ventral curvature, although 10 (23%) had complications during follow-up and 9 underwent reoperations.26 With this, the present concept of STraighten And Close (STAC) hypospadias repair or the Straighten and Graft (STAG) has been popularised by Snodgrass and Bush (Figure 8).\n\n\nFigure 8 The staged tubularized autograft (STAG) repair. (A) At the time of the first stage, one to three ventral corporotomies are made through the tunica albuginea, with the middle incision opposite the point of maximal curvature. (B) Preputial graft is marked and harvested. (C) Preputial graft is placed on the ventral aspect of the penile shaft and then quilted into place (D).

(H) Appearance after closure [From: Snodgrass W: Staged tubularized autograft repair for primary proximal hypospadias. J Urol 198:680–686, 2017].\n\nThe flaps have the said limitation of blood supply to the edges, more chances of stricture and increased rate of diverticula formation as they are less fixed to the underlying corpora. These shortcomings are overcoming the graft technique where there is uniform supply to the graft which is well fixed to the underlying corpora and thus less chances of stricture formation and diverticula formation respectively. The flowchart by Moscardi et al is useful in individualising the management of severe penile curvature in patients with proximal hypospadias (Figure 4).22\n\nDorsal Plication\n\nIn some patients where the curvature still persists or there is a glans tilt only, or if the chordee is less than 30 degrees, a dorsal plication can be done, as previously popularised by Baskin. Presently, most surgeons perform the Nesbit’s or modified Nesbit’s procedure. In this technique, a diamond-shaped wedge of dorsal lateral albuginea is resected at the point of maximum curvature and the defect is sutured transversely afterwards with a non-absorbable suture like proline.27 Several modifications to this technique have been reported, including dorsal plication without resection of the penile fascia.\n\nOne-Stage Hypospadias Repair\n\nThis usually involves dorsal plication to correct ventral penile curvature in conjunction with several different urethroplasty techniques depending upon the tissue used in the repair; preputial skin; local skin; or a buccal graft.7 Some of the one staged hypospadias repair are:\n\nTransverse preputial Island flap (Duckett tube);28 In this a preputial island flap is harvested, and tabularised it into a substitution urethroplasty. This was modified by Asopa,29 where rather than tubularising the flap before securing it to the penile shaft, the left side of the flap is anchored to the ventral surface of the penile shaft, just to the left of midline.7 Then interrupted Lembert sutures are used to close the flap in the midline. This reduces the risk of exposing the epithelium beneath the repair. The sutures are carried into the mid glans. Then, the flap is carefully placed over the suture line, and the glans wings are brought over the urethroplasty and the vascular flap. The base of the tubularized flap is anchored to the distal extent of the native urethra (Figure 9).2,7 A two-layer tubularisation is carried out, maintaining an even calibre throughout. In patients with severe curvature corrected after skin dissection and division of the urethral palpate, this approach can be helpful.7\n\nThe Onlay Island Flap procedure: OIF is indicated in boys whose curvature is corrected after penile degloving and does not require division of a relatively thin urethral plate that otherwise could not be tubularized.7 The salient features of this procedure and other one-staged hypospadias repair techniques are given below.\n\n\nFigure 9 Island tube hypospadias repair. (A) Preoperative appearance. The pink, shiny, ventral skin suggests a thinning of the ventral spongiosum. In spite of the subcoronal meatus, this is a proximal variant. (B) After degloving the meatus is located at the penoscrotal junction and is cannulated with an 8-Fr feeding tube. (C) Artificial erection after dorsal plication reveals no residual penile curvature. (D) The preputial island flap is mobilized, with harvest of the supple dartos pedicle off of the shaft skin toward the base of the penis. (E) One edge of the flap is anchored to the tunica albuginea. (F) The flap is measured to a width of 12 mm with excision of redundant epithelium. The flap is then closed over a diversion tube, approximating the epithelial edge to the previously anchored portion of the flap. (G) Completed repair.

Because of a higher risk of complications, this technique has since fallen out of favour for other two-stage repairs, such as the Byars flap or STAG repair.\n\n\nTwo-Staged Hypospadias Repair\n\nMost commonly performed procedures for severe hypospadias\n\n\n  Byars two staged repair:\n    \n      In stage 1\n        \n          Chordee correction\n          Penile straightening with removal of the ventral tethered urethral plate is performed\n          Preputial flap formed by splitting of the dorsal skin is rotated to cover ventral defect\n          Open glans widely &amp; place adequate skin flap\n        \n      \n      In Stage 2\n        \n          The area is tabularised into a urethral tube\n          Performed at least after 6 months of stage 1\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nShukla et al performed proximal hypospadias repair by the Byar’s flap technique in 700 boys over a period of 11 years.33 They reported fistula in 21 (3%) of these patients. None had complete disruption or urethral diverticula or meatal stenosis. In their series, age range of patients in our study was 3–12 years and the second stage was performed at least 1 year after the first surgery. The authors emphasised the advantages of a Byar’s flap: 1) being a vascularized skin flap, they found it to be a reliable when used in the first stage, and at the same time, there was abundant vascularized skin left to resurface the raw area that had been created as a result of chordee correction, 2) on completion of the procedure, a circumcised appearance was attained, 3) no contraction or loss unlike in the case of a graft were reported in their study.33\n\n\n  Two-stage Bracka buccal/prepucial graft hypospadias repair34\n    \n      In stage 1 (Figure 10):\n        \n          Previous scar tissue, if any, is resected\n          Glans wings mobilized\n          Buccal graft or free preputial graft is quilted to cover ventral area of the resected scar\n          The donor site for buccal mucosa is usually the lip or the cheek\n          Suturing of the mucosal defect after the removal of the graft is not recommended.\n        \n      \n      In Stage 2:\n        \n          The plate is tabularised, usually done after 6 months\n          Good procedure for re-doing urethroplasties\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 10 Courtesy Dr. Vikram Khanna, Associate Professor , Pediatric Surgery, Lady Harding Medical College and Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital, New Delhi, a) Pre-operative pic showing penoscrotal hypospadias with penoscrotal transposition, chordee and short phallus with dorsal hooded prepuce, b) Lateral profile showing the degree of chordee and the urethral plate, c) feeding tube inserted as stent using double catheter method\nd) Degloving of the penile shaft and correction of chordee, e) Prepucial skin graft harvested, f) Graft sutured to the area of the split glans wings and the area of urethral plate and corporal body, g) Complete fixation of graft with quilting performed, h) Tie over dressing done over the graft and catheter left in situ for 1 week.\n\nBracka described the concept of 2 stage hypospadias repair.34 After at least 6 months of the first stage of repair, the second stage can be performed. During this repair, any remaining chordee is corrected, tubularisation of the graft is performed, neourethra created, meatoplasty, and glansplasty done. The urethroplasty is covered by a dartos flap or a tunica vaginalis flap. In today’s era, it has become widely accepted as a primary treatment for patients with proximal hypospadias and chordee. In Bracka’s series of pediatric two staged hypospadias repair which included 457 children (369 primary repair and 88 secondary or salvage repairs) and 143 adults (22 primary and 121 secondary), 5.7%35 developed urethrocutaneous fistulae, 7%14 developed strictures, and 4.6%29 developed late onset of strictures.34,35\n\nThe use of the skin from the inner prepuce is an excellent option as the graft is thin, flexible, hairless, and withstands a moist environment. The graft is harvested and the dartos layer is removed and anastomosed ventrally to the corpora to form the neourethral plate. Tubularization of the graft is generally performed later, after 6 months. One of the problems\n\nwith foreskin graft is the availability of this graft. This is because many patients with proximal hypospadias and ventral curvature have scarce penile skin and, all the skin is needed and used for resurfacing of the penis in the initial stage. Although the use of grafts for hypospadias repair was mostly used for reoperations, some series have reported good outcomes with staged repair using preputial grafts for primary proximal hypospadias correction also.36,37\n\nIn cases where preputial skin cannot be used or is unavailable, the buccal mucosa (Figure 11) is harvested from the inner cheek and/or lower labial alveolar region and grafted to the corpora. Its properties include increased elastin, relative stiffness providing good support and ultimately diminishing the occurrence of urethral diverticulum and meatal prolapse,38,39 making it suitable for its use in hypospadias surgery. During harvesting of buccal mucosal graft, one should avoid crossing the angle of the mouth into the lower lip, thus avoiding cosmetic facial deformities. Secondly, care should be taken to avoid the Stensen’s duct when harvesting the mucosa from the inner cheek.\n\n\nFigure 11 Tubularization of graft inlay of Buccal Mucosal Graft\n\nBased on the available literature, preputial graft in primary cases is the preferred method, the other available grafts are the lingual graft and buccal mucosal grafts.40,41 In proximal hypospadias cases, most of the time, we can use the preputial mucosa, which is not really preputial skin, that is shiny , as a graft, and we don’t find skin deficiency in the first stage, since we are not covering the penis with skin in the first stage of graft placement.\n\nIn a series of 43 boys who completed both stages with postoperative follow up, Snodgrass and Bush concluded that staged tubularised autograft resulted in a straight penis with a normally positioned neo meatus in boys with the most severe proximal hypospadias in 77%.26 This number increased to 98% after 1 or 2 reoperations for complications. In their series, they also found no recurrence of ventral curvature after 3 corporotomies without corporal grafting had been performed [Snodgrass]. The mean ventral curvature for these penises was 70 degrees, and corporotomy was performed in 65%, the preputial grafts were used in 88%.26\n\nPostoperative Management and Care\n\nUrinary Drainage\n\nDrainage should be ensured by an infant feeding tube left in situ post-repair. We generally use a 6F or 8F IFT for young children and a 10F to 12F for older children, adolescents and adults. Care should be taken to place the tip of the stent inside the bladder such that there are no bladder spams due to the irritation of the trigone and there is no internal knotting due to excessive length of the catheter left inside. The best thing is to use a silicone catheter.\n\nDressing\n\nThe dressing is applied in a circular fashion around the penile shaft after adequate padding over the repaired scrotal region. It should neither be too tight, nor too loose and the glans tip should be visible or exposed for visual inspection during the post-operative period.\n\nAnother alternative could be to apply dressing and secure it to the abdominal wall with sterile plastic dressing or a sandwich dressing with Elastoplast.\n\nDuring staged repair, when using the graft in the first stage, we use a tie over dressing (Figure 10), to fix the graft, and this is removed one week later. The graft below is fixed to the underlying corporal body by quilting sutures. The tie over dressing helps obliterate any free space between the graft and the underlying corpora, sweep out the excess fluid and aids in better apposition of the graft tissue.\n\nComplications\n\nThe brief overview of the main complications post repair can be either related to urethroplasty or skin complications.7\n\nUrethroplasty Complications\n\n\n  Fistula\n  Glans dehiscence\n  Meatal stenosis obstructive symptoms (straining, prolonged voiding, urinary tract infection, and/or retention)\n  Urethral stricture\n  Urethral diverticulum\n\n\nSkin Complications\n\n\n  Skin necrosis\n  Penile torsion &gt; 30 degrees- angle between the normal and true vertical glanular plane &gt;30 degrees from midline (specify clockwise or counterclockwise)\n  Preputial fistula - fistula-like defect in the preputial skin that has no contact with the urethral lumen\n  Preputial dehiscence after preputial reconstruction: defect in the preputial skin recreating an incomplete prepuce\n  Lichen sclerosus\n\n\nThese could also be defined as early in the form of glans ischaemia, preputial flap necrosis, catheter blockage, premature expulsion of catheter and wound infection. The late complications include urethrocutaneous fistula formation, glans dehiscence, meatal stenosis, recurrent or residual chordee, urethral stricture, urethral dehiscence and urethral diverticulum.\n\nTable 3 The complications of various 2-stage graft studies have been highlighted, a 48 (out of 140) patients only were managed with two-stages using preputial graft, b 15 (30%) patients had multiple complication, c 44 were primary cases with 8 being redo.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Study\n      Number patients\n      Mean follow up (months)\n      Meatal location\n      Repair type\n      Overall complications (%)\n      Meatal stenosis (%)\n      Dehiscence (%)\n      Stricture (%)\n      Urethral diverticulae (%)\n      Fistula (%)\n      Residual curvature (%)\n      Other\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Ferro, 200236\n      34\n      1–48 (range)\n      proximal\n      2-stage preputial graft\n      8 (24%)\n      0\n      4 (11.7%)\n      1 (3%)\n      1 (3%)\n      2 (6%)\n      —\n      —\n    \n    \n      Johal, 200637\n      62\n      26 (median)\n      midshaft / proximal\n      2-stage graft\n      11 (18%)\n      3 (5%)\n      3 (5%)\n      0\n      0\n      0\n      3 (5%)\n      Deviated stream 2 (3%)\n    \n    \n      Pippe Salle, 201614\n      48a\n      29.6 (median)\n      proximal\n      2-stage graft\n      16 (33.3%)\n      0\n      7 (14.5%)\n      1 (2%)\n      1 (2%)\n      5 (10.4%)\n      2 (4.1%)\n      —\n    \n    \n      Faure, 201642\n      52\n      34 (median)\n      proximal / redoc\n      2-stage graft (preputial/BMG)\n      20 (38.4%)\n      8 (15.3%)\n      1 (1.9%)\n      4 (7.6%)\n      1 (1.9%)\n      8 (15.3%)\n      0\n      —\n    \n    \n      Sakr, 201743\n      23\n      12\n      redo\n      2-stage (lingual graft)\n      3 (13%)\n      0\n      1\n      0\n      0\n      2\n      0\n      —\n    \n    \n      Snodgrass, 201726\n      43\n      22\n      proximal\n      2-stage\n      10 (24%)\n      0\n      7 (16.2%)\n      0\n      1 (2.3%)\n      2 (4.6%)\n      0\n      —\n    \n    \n      Lanciotti, 201740\n      50\n      63.6\n      proximal\n      2-stage (bladder graft)\n      23 (46%)b\n      4 (8%)\n      0\n      15 (30%)\n      6 (12%)\n      9 (18%)\n      5 (10%)\n      Prolapse of meatus 7 (14%)\n    \n  \n\n\nTable 4 The complications of various 2-stage flap repair studies have been highlighted. a combined 2-stage technique with distal TIP and tubularized Byars flap, b - VC reassessed during the 2-stage with an artificial erection, c 37 were staged in 2 procedures, d 6 had bladder tube, buccal grafts etc, e 12 (out of 140) patients only were managed with two-stages preputial flaps, f 81 (out of 167) patients were managed with two-stages preputial flaps, TPIF=transverse preputial island flap;

They observed a disproportionate number of complications (35%) occurred in the boys with proximal hypospadias, with a proximal hypospadias complication rate of 39/86 (45%).51 This contrasted sharply with the 17% overall complication rate.51\n\nMost proximal hypospadias repair patients require a longer and closer follow-up for a detailed and honest reporting of complications. A hypospadias criple can be defined as a boy who often requires multiple, complex procedures to correct the sequelae of a failed initial repair.52 Due to the longer urethroplasty tube, there is a greater the risk for stricture or a profound effect of the failure of the reconstructed urethra to expand with voiding, increasing resistance to urine flow, ultimately resulting in fistula and/or urethral diverticulum formation as highlighted by Braga et al.53 Hence there has been underreporting of the complications for proximal hypospadias previously.\n\nTo improve the outcomes of repair of proximal hypospadias, Long and Canning51 pointed that a standardized system to systematically quantify the severity of the hypospadias phenotype so as to create a universal hypospadias language that would facilitate collaboration across institutions can be used. Presently, the scoring systems used are the HOSE, HOPE, and GMS13,54 which include various factors like the glans width, degree of penile curvature, and quality of urethral plate to for a given patient and calculate a particular score. This has to an extent simplified comparison for outcome analysis, barring a few patient related and inter-observer surgeon limitations.\n\nThey also highlighted the importance of the patient and family assessment being collated with surgeon analysis after surgical intervention51 as they may not always match. The penile perception score takes into account this limitation.55 Weber et al55 in their study evaluated 77 boys (6–17 years old) who had undergone hypospadias repair regarding their penile self-perception with regard to the meatus, glans, skin and general appearance. They found that the inter-correlation of these items “meatus,” “glans” and “skin” with “general appearance” was good among the boys, parents and urologists. Patients with hypospadias expressed high satisfaction with the penile appearance, which did not differ significantly from their age-matched controls. Interestingly, however, the parents and urologists were less satisfied with the penile appearance than were the patients themselves.55 This highlights the importance of self-assessment by the patient and the parents, apart from the operating surgeon.\n\nAnother method suggested by Long et al is by coaching and teamwork51 utilizing various opportunities like meetings, conference, workshops, critical analysis of recorded videos in a closed group, feedback and discussion. This would definitely increase exposure and advance understanding of this complex and rare disease of proximal hypospadias.\n\nReferences\n\n\nBaskin LS. Chapter 121 - Hypospadias.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nSecondary hypospadias is a term reserved for individuals with persistent anatomical and functional complications following multiple corrective hypospadias repairs. These include stricture formation, urethrocutaneous fistula, glans dehiscence, urethral dehiscence, persistent chordee and glans deformity. Hypospadias is defined by three main characteristics: a ventrally sited meatus, varying degree of chordee, and a 'hooded’ appearance of the foreskin due to the excess dorsal preputial skin, with each component exhibiting a broad spectrum of severity. Hence, in patients who present for a redo surgery following a primary repair, it is vital to recognize the combination of individual components which has failed to maximize the outcome in a redo surgery. There is also a higher rate of recurrent fistulation and strictures due to reduced tissue vascularity.\n\nAnother critical aspect to bear in mind is that the population of patients who require a secondary repair tend to be older, with studies highlighting a significant degree of psychological comorbidity and neurodevelopmental disorders.1,2 The majority of hypospadias ‘cripples’ would have had on average more than three failed attempts at urethroplasty, and failure tends to follow many years after achieving an initial satisfactory outcome.3 Anthony Mundy described the magnitude of this challenge in managing these cohorts of patients in his editorial review. He emphasised that it is almost impossible to write a good journal article on failed hypospadias repair.4 In recognizing the complications following a primary hypospadias repair, one cannot adopt a ‘one size fits all approach’ but requires an individually tailored approach. This chapter outlines the incidence and the predisposing factors and proposes a general management algorithm for children who need redo hypospadias surgery. In addition, the surgical technique preferably used in our institution will be described. This chapter will also review alternative strategies for each of the common individual complications that subsequently leads to the need for a redo procedure.\n\n\nFigure 1 Preputial skin graft with quilting sutures in a 1st stage hypospadias repair. Note the glan penis, which has been split and laid wide open.\n\n\nFigure 2 Rolled jelonet secured to provide moisture and immobilize the skin graft.\n\nIncidence\n\nRedo surgeries are primarily dependent on two critical factors: the institution’s case volume and the technical experience of the operating surgeon. Therefore, this incidence varies widely among centres. Barbagli et al reported in their retrospective analysis of a single cohort of adolescents that 50% of the patients with penile stricture had a history of a failed hypospadias repair. Of the cohort, 16.4% had undergone surgery for primary distal hypospadias, and most had more than one operation to repair the primary defect. Demographically, 21.2% of patients were 1 to 16 years old, and 38.4% were 17 to 20 years old.5 These findings highlighted the need for a long-term follow-up and emphasised the need for an effective transition of care.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nUrethroplasty complications increases two-fold in people undergoing a second hypospadias urethroplasty compared with those repaired primarily. These risks increase to 40% with three or more further re-operations.6 The aetiopathology of failed hypospadias repair is multifactorial. Postoperative infection, urine extravasation, residual scar tissues, haematoma, and poor surgical techniques contribute to the graft's impaired tissue healing and ischemia. The scarred ventral tissues combined with the lack of surrounding tissue in secondarily repaired hypospadias predispose patients to a poor outcome.7 Theoretically, the mismatch between the growth of the reconstructed neourethra and the growth spurt of the surrounding cavernosal tissue during the onset of puberty can potentially result in a short narrow tube and manifest as a stricture. In the paediatric population, it is recognized that older age at repair is associated with a higher risk of complications.8 Our opinion is that an experienced hypospadias surgeon should undertake a secondary repair in a high-volume centre. There is evidence that the surgical volume correlates positively with patient outcomes, especially in these group of patients.9\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThe clinical evaluation of patients does not differ widely from those who present primarily with hypospadias. Operative details of previous operations are imperative if the patients present from a different centre. When contemplating repair, one should document the meatal location, glans volume, penile length, recurrent chordee (if any), depth, and width of the urethral plate. Other equally critical considerations are the extent of the scarred tissue and the availability of sites for donor graft, should a two-stage approach be undertaken. A thorough physical examination is mandatory and documented in full detail, with additional radiological assessment rarely necessary. The patient characteristics and a surgeon's technical preference and experience will play a role in influencing the type of repair. Lastly, the potential risks and benefits of the secondary repair should be discussed together with the parents as a shared decision-making process.\n\nPerioperative Planning\n\nEmbarking on a redo surgery for hypospadias is technically challenging and associated with higher complication rates. The functional outcome will always be the priority over cosmesis, which should be communicated clearly. The \"normal\" meatal location is widely considered the glans' distal tip. However, significant variation of meatal location has been reported to preserve sexual and voiding function throughout adulthood in men with untreated hypospadias.10 Apart from just the meatal site, a survey found that men with untreated \"milder\" or distal hypospadias report difficulties with sexual intercourse, mostly associated with the penile curvature but with no significant urinary issues compared to normal men.10 Considering the survey result and when applied to the context of secondary repairs, chordee correction would be the prime consideration. If a two-stage surgical approach is contemplated, a minimum of 6-month interval is recommended between procedures to allow proper wound healing. Adjuncts to support tissue healing in redo hypospadias repairs have been reported in the literature, especially nitroglycerin injections and hyperbaric oxygen therapy to increase tissue vascularity and promote wound healing.11 However, these supportive treatment therapies are yet to gain wide acceptance. In children with a small penile glans’ and a short phallus, there is a continuing debate within the fraternity over the use of preoperative androgen stimulation. Some quarters advocate its use in severe hypospadias to increase phallus length, glans circumference, penile vascularity, and tissue robustness which are essential in any redo repair. However, conflicting evidence suggests that a preoperative hormonal stimulation is associated with increased complication rates in proximal hypospadias, though statistically not significant.12\n\nAntibiotics\n\nWe would advocate antibiotic cover in a redo hypospadias to minimize the risk of the surgical site and urinary tract infections. A preoperative urine culture should be taken, and the presence of bacteriuria to be treated based on the culture and sensitivity. Despite studies finding no significant difference in the surgical site and urinary tract infections with or without preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis,13,14 we use co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 30 mg/kg) intravenously as our first-choice antibiotic. It is then continued orally in the post-operative period for one week until the catheter and dressing is removed. Our practice is generally aligned with the study that reported 91% of paediatric urologists prescribe postoperative antibiotics when a urethral catheter is left in place.15 Even though debatable, a recent meta-analysis assessing the effects of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis after hypospadias repair found limited utility in preventing infections and wound healing complications, although the risk of bias was high in many of the studies.16,17 Supporting patients’ recovery with adequate analgesia is essential for as they would usually require a more extensive tissue dissection with a more complex reconstruction. A caudal block would be the most common choice for perioperative pain control. Alternatively, peripheral nerve blocks (dorsal nerve penile and pudendal nerve blocks) can also be utilised. Evidence remains inconclusive regarding the choice of analgesia and its relation to postoperative outcome in hypospadias repairs.18,19\n\n\nFigure 3 Appearance of the skin graft one week following surgery.

Good healing with no evidence of graft contracture. It is ready for the 2nd stage of the repair.\n\nSurgical Techniques\n\nDifferent approaches for salvage techniques have been reported in redo hypospadias, including tubularised incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty, the Mathieu repair, onlay tubularised island flaps (OIF), and free grafts, done in either as a single-stage or a two-stage approach. Regardless of the different techniques, one should always apply the general principles of surgery and repair. Minimal use of cautery, tension-free sutures, well-vascularised grafts or surrounding tissue, and multiple layers with watertight closure will minimise the usual potential complications. A TIP urethroplasty can be an option in a single-stage repair setting if the urethral plate is present and wide enough. Snodgrass and Lorenzo reported their initial experience of using TIP urethroplasty in redo hypospadias repair. They had 15 patients with a mean follow-up of 5 months. They achieved a cosmetically normal meatus in 13 of 15 patients, and complications comprised two fistulae and one glans dehiscence.6 Shanberg and colleagues reported TIP urethroplasty in 13 redo cases with a mean follow-up of 22 months. Cosmetic results were excellent, with two complications: one patient with glans dehiscence and a urethrocutaneous fistula, and a second patient who developed meatal stenosis.20 A grossly scarred urethral plate contributing to chordee should be excised and replaced with a buccal mucosa graft for a two-stage repair as advocated by Bracka.21\n\nBracka popularized the two-stage repair in hypospadias surgery as a potential solution to the high complication rates observed following a single-stage approach. He reported the most extensive series in the literature with six hundred cases (457 children and 143 adults), of which 34.8% were secondary repairs. In total, 3.7% required revision of the first stage. The urethrocutaneous fistula rate was 10.5% for salvage surgery, while the stricture formation rate was 7%.22 Hayes et al reported using buccal grafts in multistage repairs in 25 patients (both adults and children) with previously failed hypospadias repair. 22% required 1st stage revision, while only one patient (4%) developed a urethrocutaneous fistula.23 Barbagli et al studied 60 adults with secondary hypospadias, of whom 31 cases underwent multistage repairs. Buccal grafts resulted in 82% success in one-stage procedures and 82% in multistage procedures. The fistula rate for one-stage and two-stage operations was 10.3% and 6.5%, respectively.5 Kulkarni et al highlighted the higher incidence of buccal graft contracture in their series of patients undergoing a 2-stage repair with BMGs (Buccal mucosa graft), which prompted their change in technique to a hybrid approach.24\n\nAt Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH), our two-stage repair combines techniques historically described by Turner-Warwick, Duplay, and Cloutier.25 At the first-stage repair, the scarred urethra is opened ventrally in the midline back to healthy bleeding tissue. A circumcision incision is completed around the corona of the penis, often coinciding with the previous incision and leaving a cuff of mucosa proximal to the glans. The scarred area within the glans is then excised, and the glans is opened, laid open by a deep incision in the midline, and then lifting the glanular tissue off the apex. The urethra is extended to a healthy area with good calibre tissue before excision of distal neo-urethra and scar tissue. The failed neourethra is excised partially or entirely back to the healthy tissue. Chordee is identified by an artificial erection, using a tourniquet and saline injection, and is corrected by a combination of the ventral release of the scarred neo-urethra and additional dorsal tunica albuginea plications where indicated. A wide proximal urethral opening needs to be fashioned, and the shaft skin reapplied to the dorsum of the penis. This leaves a variable raw area on the ventral surface from the urethral opening to the tip of the glans distally and between the skin edges. If an excess of healthy preputial skin is available, we use this in preference to other grafts. It is however, usually necessary, to take alternatively sited grafts. These are commonly the posterior auricular skin (Wolfe) graft, inner cheek buccal mucosal graft, and composite grafts (buccal mucosal graft plus inner prepuce). The skin graft of choice is harvested and then de-fat before applying to the raw area on the ventral surface of the penis. The grafts are usually rectangular (at least 2 cm wide), sutured circumferentially with 6/0 monocryl, and we attach it onto the penile corpora with additional quilting sutures. Grafts are compressed onto the shaft of the penis using a rolled jelonet (paraffin gauze) and sutured in place by joining the shaft skin edges together over the top. We then cover the penis and apply additional pressure using a foam and an outer wrap of Elastoplast tape. A dripping stent or continuously draining catheter is used according to the patient's age (all patients under six years of age will have a dripping stent).\n\nAntibiotics and anticholinergics will be given for the first week The dressing is removed and graft is inspected under general anaesthetic. The parents are instructed to apply chloramphenicol ointment to the graft twice daily for ten days. After three months review in the outpatients’clinic, the second-stage procedure is planned if the graft is satisfactory. If not, a period of dihydrotestosterone ointment application will be used to further mature the graft and stimulate penile growth. Second-stage procedures are performed no earlier than six months, and most cases are repaired nearer to 1 year. The urethral strip and glans are closed around an 8-Fr catheter, using 6-0 monocryl sutures. A further foam dressing is applied with catheter drainage, antibiotics, and anticholinergics for one week. This is followed by dressing removal by our nursing staff on the ward (without any sedation). Patients are followed up at 3 and 12 months in the outpatients’ clinic.\n\nUrethrocutaneous Fistula\n\nUrethrocutaneous fistula is one of the most common complications of post-primary hypospadias repair, with the incidence quoted between 5% to 15%. Recognised risks include the age of repair, haematoma, graft necrosis, urinary extravasation, wound infection, and the operating surgeon’s experience. A multicentre retrospective review of 591 patients by Duarsa et al concluded that suprapubic drainage reduces the risk of urethrocutaneous fistula following hypospadias repair. The authors postulated that creating a temporary urinary diversion percutaneously reduces urinary drainage to the neourethra and minimises tissue reaction, stitch mobility, and risk of infection.10 It is also vital to exclude distal neo-meatal stenosis or ischemia of the ventral skin. The surgical management will depend on the size of the meatus, the number of fistulas, and if there are any concomitant neo-urethra strictures. Kulkarni et al have described their fistula repair techniques, whereby in cases of narrow meatus with a urethral stricture, the urethra is incised ventrally till a good calibre urethra is seen. If the urethral plate is more than 8 mm, then an Asopa single-stage dorsal inlay graft augmentation urethroplasty is performed. If the width is less than 8 mm, then a two-stage approach is employed to tubularise a neourethra. Finally, if the urethra is of a good calibre without distal obstruction, the urethrocutaneous fistula can be closed primarily.24\n\nRecurrent Ventral Chordee\n\nVentral chordee (VC) is observed more frequently in patients who have undergone a dorsal plication in contrast to a ventral penile lengthening procedure. Another contributing factor is the contracture of the scarred ventral skin and peri-urethral fibrous tissue. Flynn et al reported the late onset of recurrent penile chordee post hypospadias repair after puberty. Most of their patients reported that the penile curvature was associated with the growth of the phallus at puberty. They postulated that recurrent VC, especially in adolescents, is due to the corporal wall asymmetry, which may be secondary to disproportionate growth of the hypoplastic ventral corporal wall or the reconstructed urethra.26 A mismatch between a short ventral urethra and corporal tissues is crucial in recurrent ventral chordee.27 In the majority, a ‘mild’ (less than 30 degrees) chordee can be corrected by skin dissection or transecting the urethral plate. The majority in redo hypospadias will need an underlying corporal disproportion addressed with essentially two possible options: to make the long side short or to make the short side long. Among hypospadias patients where length is precious, it is probably best to avoid dorsal plication. Transverse ventral corporotomies are preferred in recurrent chordees, leading to a reasonable degree of correction. In cases of curvature more than 30 degrees, a staged repair starting with excision of the urethra and placement of a dermal graft to the corpora and coverage with dartos flap and local skin flap is an option that can be considered.24\n\n\nFigure 5 Final appearance following tubularization at the end of the 2nd stage repair. The catheter will be left for seven days, followed by a dressing removal in the ward.\n\n\nFigure 6 Presence of an isolated urethrocutaneous fistula following hypospadias repair. It is amenable to a simple fistula excision and closure\n\nPostoperative Care\n\nSecondary hypospadias repair at GOSH is performed as a one-day admission inpatient procedure with the child discharged the following day following an overnight observation. We catheterise all boys with a soft 8-French feeding tube and secure it to the glans with a 4-0 prolene stay suture, which stays in place for seven days. Occlusive wrapped around dressing optimises postoperative healing by promoting immobilization, surgical site protection, tissue adherence, and compression. Currently, there is no consensus on the most effective dressing type or whether applying a dressing is beneficial at all. A randomized trial found no significant difference in complication rates or clinical outcomes when patients with a dressing and without one were compared. Of note, there were significantly increased postoperative calls by parents in the non-dressing group.28 Following the dressing technique as described before, we place double nappies in children who are not yet toilet trained. The catheter and dressing are removed after seven days, under general anaesthesia for the first-stage repairs with graft and locally on the ward following the second stage repairs. A Foley catheter is connected to a drainage bag in older children. We prescribe oral antibiotics per our local microbiology policy and oxybutynin 0.2 g/kg once daily until the catheter is removed to prevent bladder spasms. The preoperative caudal nerve block helps ameliorate postoperative pain.29 Further pain control is achieved with low doses of NSAID (non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs) analgesics.\n\nConclusion\n\nRedo hypospadias is a surgically challenging entity to treat and manage among surgeons actively caring for children with hypospadias. Due to its low complication rate and reproducible techniques, the authors advocate a two-stage repair for a redo hypospadias surgery. Nevertheless, if all fails despite the best of attempts, perineal urethrostomy can also be considered an option to preserve the quality of life in these patients. There is limited high-quality evidence in the current literature examining the various aspects of the surgical management of redo hypospadias. Therefore, more effort into further research to improve patient outcomes should be encouraged. An outline of a simple algorithm for the surgical management of redo hypospadias is outlined below.\n\n\nFigure 7 Proposed management algorithm for reoperative or redo hypospadias.\n\nResources for Family\n\n\n  Hypospadias Resources, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia\n  Urology Information for parents and visitors, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Shukla AR, Patel RP, Canning DA.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThis chapter aims to discuss other penile conditions that may be encountered (apart from hypospadias) which may potentially warrant surgical intervention or correction. These include chordee, penile torsion, buried penis and congenital megaprepuce.\n\nChordee and penile torsion may be associated with hypospadias or other urological conditions; or may be an isolated entity. The term congenital chordee has been used interchangeably as chordee without hypospadias, congenital short urethra and congenital penile curvature throughout literature. Snodgrass proposed that ‘chordee without hypospadias’ be replaced by ‘congenital penile curvature’ and will be referred to as such throughout this chapter.1 There are varying degrees of congenital penile curvature. This can be ventral, dorsal, and lateral or a combination of the three.\n\nPenile torsion is an abnormal rotation of the penile shaft that occurs most frequently in the counterclockwise direction. Congenital penile curvature and penile torsion have also been reported to occur simultaneously.2\n\nThere are varied presentations of the buried penis or congenital megaprepuce. These conditions can vary in the spectrum they present and are commonly confused with micropenis, however, the size of the penis is usually normal. A presenting complaint may be difficulty with voiding as a result of urine entrapment in boys with a congenital megaprepuce. There are many terms and descriptors that have been used to describe the condition: hidden, concealed, inconspicuous, invisible, entrapped, and buried penis amongst others. These broad encompassing terms correlate to describing the appearance of the penis but may not be the defining the anatomical cause.3 As with its nomenclature, many approaches for its correction have been documented.\n\nEmbryology\n\nDuring its growth, the external genitalia develops swiftly which can result in large morphological variations.4 Between the 4th and 7th weeks of gestation, the genital tubercle is formed by migration of mesodermal mesenchyme to the cranial region of the cloacal membrane. The caudal region of the cloacal membrane forms the urogenital folds. The cloacal membrane is a dual-layered structure, having an endoderm and an ectoderm. From the 7th week of gestation, external genital differentiation in the male sex occurs. This is completed by 16–17 weeks of gestation. The SRY gene on the Y chromosome signals the development of the primitive sex cords to form testes. Leydig cells within the testes produce testosterone which is converted to dihydrotestosterone to promote development of external genitalia of males.5\n\nIn the male, androgens cause the mesoderm of the genital tubercle to form the corpora cavernosa and glans penis. The proximal penile urethra is a result of tubularization of the endoderm. This is in comparison to the distal penile urethra that occurs as a result of recanalisation.6 During the 8th week of gestation, the ectoderm develops into penile skin and prepuce. Bellinger and Kaplan demonstrated that penile curvature is a normal state of development, with resolution by the 16th week of gestation,7,8\n\nCongenital Penile Curvature\n\nHistory\n\nNesbit first described three cases of congenital penile curvature in 1965. He suggested that this condition was secondary to disproportionate fascial lengths surrounding the corporal bodies.9\n\nCongenital penile torsion was first described by Verneuil in 1857. At the time, operative intervention was advised against as attempts to mobilise skin were unsuccessful in correcting the spiral alignment of the corpora cavernosa. Fevre described a technique for repair of penile torsion in 1947, where he removed the crura from the pubis and reinserted them into a normal position.10,11\n\nEpidemiology\n\nEarly papers have noted that congenital penile curvature occurs in 4–10% of males.12,13 The incidence of dorsal curvature is low in the absence of hypospadias, with rates of ~5% being described.14\n\nThe incidence of congenital penile torsion ranges from 1.5–27%.15,16 Significant penile torsion of more than 90 degrees is less frequent, affecting 0.7% of newborn males.16\n\nPathogenesis\n\nIn 1937, Young theorised that penile curvature was secondary to a congenitally short urethra. Abnormal development of periurethral fascia was proposed by Devine and Horton as a cause.17 Kramer proposed that corporal body disproportion was the contributor to penile curvature.13 In their series, Donnahoo noted penile curvature secondary to tethering of skin and dartos as the most common cause (65%), corporeal body disproportion (28%), and a congenitally shortened urethra (7%). This study noted rates of ventral (84%), dorsal (11%), and lateral (5%) curvature.12 Histopathological study of the urethral plate demonstrated the absence of fibrosis and dysplasia in samples taken intraoperatively.18 This evidence however, refutes the theory of fibrous bands causing penile curvature. Arrest in penile development whilst the penis has a physiological curve has also been proposed as a cause to persistent penile curvature.7\n\nAcquired dorsal curvature may occur as a result of scar contraction or abnormal scarring following a circumcision.19\n\nThe exact aetiology of congenital penile torsion is unknown. Proposed theories include abnormal skin attachment, asymmetric development of corpora cavernosa, and rotational defect of either the corporal bodies or the glans.11,20\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nIn the male with hypospadias, the presence of congenital penile curvature and torsion is frequently assessed intra-operatively following an artificial erection test.\n\nIn children without hypospadias, it is often parental observation that raises the concern of penile curvature. During adolescence, penile curvature becomes evident following natural erections. Another instance that may lead to the detection of these conditions is as an incidental finding during a routine medical examination. Torsion may be suspected if the penile raphae deviates from the midline. The presence of these conditions, however, is less obvious in children with a physiological phimosis. Assessment in the clinic can also be limited by poor patient cooperation and body habitus.19 Intraoperative assessment of penile curvature is achieved by an artificial erection test.\n\nAn operative classification of congenital penile curvature was proposed by Devine and Horton into three categories. Group I, secondary to deficient corpus spongiosum, dartos, and Buck fascia; Group II due to deficient dartos and Buck fascia; and Group III involved only dartos fascia.17 This classification system was expanded upon to include Group IV which was representative of corporal body disproportion.13 An additional operative classification system by Donnahoo et al described three types of congenital penile curvature; Type I is curvature secondary to skin tethering (Figure 1) and (Figure 2) Type II is due to fascial chordee, and Type III is a result of corporal body disproportion.12\n\n\nFigure 1 Type 1 curvature with hooded foreskin and apical meatus.\n\n\nFigure 2 Erection test after degloving showing curvature corrected.\n\nTreatment Options\n\nIf diagnosed early, surgical correction of congenital penile curvature should ideally occur during the first year of life.21 The surgical options for managing penile curvature are dependent on the severity, preferably with the least invasive technique attempted initially.19 A survey of paediatric urologists run by AAP, found that penile curvature up to 10 degrees would frequently be left untreated. A penile curvature of more than 20 degrees to 30 degrees requires intervention, hence this severity was labelled as significant chordee.22,23 The survey found that any penile curvature less than 50 degrees was often managed by dorsal plication, whereas curvature greater than 50 degrees would commonly require a ventral lengthening procedure.22\n\nIn the presence of glans tilt, an initial frenular release is recommended as a first step. The penis is degloved to its base to address skin tethering. An artificial erection test is performed to demonstrate persistent penile curvature. Plication is suggested for residual penile curvature up to 30 degrees.1 The Nesbit technique was one of the earliest methods to correct penile curvature. This involved dissection of the dorsal neurovascular bundle off the corpora followed by plication of the tunica albuginea to correct the existent length disproportion with the ventral aspect. This technique was later modified after observing a recurrence and involved the excision of a diamond-shaped wedge at the site of maximal curvature and transverse apposition of the tunica edges.9 Neuroanatomical studies demonstrated that nerve branches to the penis are located at 11 and 1 o’clock and spread ventrally.5 Therefore, dorsal midline plication is performed in the 12 o’clock position avoiding the neurovascular bundle. This area is also the thickest and strongest region of the tunica.21,24 Whether a single plication suture or multiple plication sutures are used remains the choice of the surgeon.\n\nThere are various techniques to manage penile curvature that is greater than 30 degrees, including urethral plate transection and ventral corporotomy (with or without grafting the corporal defect) and staged urethroplasty.1,13 This provides ventral lengthening to address corporal disproportion. The initial dermal graft was described by Devine and Horton.17\n\nTo avoid urethral plate transection, Mollard and Castagnola proposed dissection of the urethra from underlying corpora cavernosa in addition to dorsal plication.25 Similarly, dissection of the urethra from corpora was performed and extended to the bulbar urethra.26\n\nCongenital penile curvature was managed by Donnahoo et al using complete mobilisation of the urethra with ventral dermal grafting.12 This was similar to the experience by Tang in up to a quarter of their patients.23\n\nOther techniques to manage complex presentations of chordee associated with hypospadias or epispadias include corporal body dissociation and penile disassembly and grafting with small intestinal submucosa,27,28,29,30\n\nModification of preceding Shaeer I and II techniques, involved rotation of the corpora with suture fixation without a corporotomy.31\n\nCorrection of penile torsion is argued to be a cosmetic procedure, as the penis remains functionally acceptable. Some authors have advocated for repair of penile torsion if the degree of torsion is more than 45 degrees. There are multiple surgical options for correction of penile torsion. A step-wise operative approach has been proposed which involves penile degloving, broad dartos-based rotation flap, mobilisation of urethral plate and spongiosum, mobilisation of proximal urethra, and mobilisation of urethral plate/hypoplastic urethra with spongiosum into the glans.32,33 An additional method described is lateral suturing of the tunica albuginea to the pubic periosteum.20 Some have described penile degloving and reattaching the skin, however these results have not always been successful.20\n\nComplications\n\nComplications after penile curvature repair vary from 5% up to 50% depending on the severity of curvature with an overall rate of 8% and include glans dehiscence, urethrocutaneous fistula, recurrent curvature and erectile dysfunction being the most common,23,12,34\n\nComplications of repair of penile torsion include haematoma, residual penile torsion, reduced parental or patient satisfaction.35\n\nSuggested Follow-Up and Outcomes\n\nInitial postoperative outpatient review can range from six to twelve weeks dependent on the surgeon’s preference. Regarding penile curvature, assessment is via parental and or patient observation of natural erections in addition to physical examination in the outpatient clinic. There are limited studies focussing on appropriate duration of post operative follow-up.23\n\nCongenital Megaprepuce\n\nHistory\n\nThe first published description of buried penis was by Keyes in 1919 where he described the condition arose because the penis lacked its proper ‘sheath of skin’ and remained ‘buried beneath the integument of the abdomen, thigh or scrotum’.36,37 Since 1919, there have been several documented case reports and discussions in this topic with its early contributors laying the platform for the greater work that has been done in the last twenty to thirty years. Campbell in 1951 described “concealed penis” as “a rudimentary organ hidden beneath the skin of the scrotum, perineum, lower abdomen or thigh in the fatty tissues which may be unusually thick”, Glanz in 1968 reported a case in an adult, Warkany in 1971 described a “micropenis or concealed penis”. Williams in 1974 described and illustrated with an example. In 1977, apart from describing his six cases, Crawford proposed the first classification for buried penis.38\n\nInterestingly, two early contributing landmark reports included radiological studies. In 1974 Gwinn and colleagues described in their “radiological case of the month” an 18-month-old boy who had an intravenous urogram done for Hodgkin lymphoma staging. During the voiding phase, they noted that “all of the contrast in his bladder descended into a striking bulbous distention of the prepuce”.\n\nAlthough not specifically named, their report probably gives the first description of a megaprepuce.39,40 Twenty years later, in 1994, O’Brien et al reported a case of an eleven-month-old boy who was noted to have a “large spheroidal swelling, about the size of an orange” and how his mother “demonstrated how the swelling could be readily deflated by manual compression”. At urethroscopy, they failed to find the meatus because of the redundant prepuce. A suprapubic catheter was placed and a micturating cystogram was performed. Apart from demonstrating a normal bladder and urethra, it was noted that contrast flowed into a large preputial bladder with a capacity as great as his urinary bladder”. They coined the term congenital megaprepuce to describe this which was the first documented use,40,41\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe exact incidence of inconspicuous penis is unknown. However, it has been proposed that this is an emerging condition.42 In a recent literature review, case numbers ranged from 1 to 134 patients, with ages ranging from 2 months to 33 years. On average, surgery was performed before 24 months of age.43\n\nPathogenesis\n\nInconspicuous penis may develop as a result of multiple factors rather than a single one. These may include deficiency of penile skin, abnormal attachment of the shaft skin at the base of the penis, penile skin being tethered forward because of dysgenetic dartos and prominent prepubic fat pad. Secondary causes result from complications of cicatricial scarring after circumcision or a large hernia or hydrocele.44\n\nThe exact etiology of congenital megaprepuce is not understood but the widely proposed theory is that it results from the tethering effects of abnormal dartos on the shaft of the penis. This is supported by early approaches to the correction of the buried penis, which noted that correction of the defect was successfully achieved by resection of the dartos tissue. A prospective study looking at the histology of dartos noted that almost 80% of patients had abnormal dartos tissue that either had poorly developed smooth muscle fibers or randomly distributed smooth muscle fibers. Interestingly patients with buried penis were more likely to have abnormal dartos compared to the hypospadias group (78% compared to 70%).45 Increased urine volume production after the neonatal period and an abnormal voiding stream due to a narrow preputial opening are what contributes to the ballooning effect of the condition.46\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nIt is important to distinguish between a normal sized penis that is hidden versus a micropenis. This is the first assessment necessary as the management path is quite different for the two. The former would need ongoing care and most likely operative intervention with the Urologist while the latter would require further evaluation and combined care with the Endocrine and Genetics team. This chapter will not be discussing the management of micropenis.\n\nCrawford first classified the buried penis into concealed, buried and penoscrotal web.38 Maizels et al described the different etiologies as: buried, webbed, trapped or micro/ diminutive. This classification has been the most widely used as it encompasses what groups the child may fall into based on clinical examination.47 While describing their surgical approach (Ventral V-plasty) for the correction of the congenital megaprepuce, Alexander and colleagues suggested a classification with more accurate anatomical description and the potential underlying cause (Figure 3), (Figure 4), (Figure 5), (Figure 6), and (Figure 7)3\n\n\nFigure 3 Classification of the causes of an inconspicuous penis (Alexander et al).\n\n\nFigure 4 Trapped penis post circumcision\n\n\nFigure 5 Congenital megaprepuce\n\n\nFigure 6 Concealed penis\n\n\nFigure 7 Penoscrotal fusion\n\nHadidi proposed dividing patients with buried penis into three groups according to their operative findings. Grade 1 – patients with an abnormally long inner prepuce (LIP), Grade 2 – LIP and abnormal distal attachments of the fundiform and suspensory ligaments into the midshaft of the penis, Grade 3 – Grade 1 and 2 plus excess suprapubic fat.37\n\nTreatment Options\n\nMultiple surgical approaches have been described for the exhumation and correction of this group of conditions. The exact timing for surgery has been a contentious issue and essentially influenced by the underlying cause. Advocates for early intervention state reasons that are similar for the timing of hypospadias repair – early intervention (6-12months of age) is advisable to avoid psychological consequences.44,48 Those that are symptomatic (urinary retention, recurrent balanitis, urine tract infections) will benefit from earlier surgery. Other authors recommend surgical correction as soon as the diagnosis is made to resolve both urinary and cosmetic aspects,49,50 On the other hand, correction of a concealed penis resulting from a prominent prepubic fat pad can be delayed as it can improve spontaneously with time, with Donahoe and Keating describing that an adequate skin coverage of the penile shaft was observed with erections.51\n\nThere is an array of literature and techniques that describe the correction of congenital megaprepuce.3,42,43,46,52 The main surgical steps are listed below with variations in how each step is performed leading to the diversity of techniques. They can be classified predominantly into either a single (majority of techniques) or a two-stage approach. In the latter a preputioplasty is initially performed with later reassessment of the anatomy after toilet training.\n\nThe surgical steps are:\n\n\n  Removal of the stenotic or phimotic ring\n  Unfurling of the prepuce\n  Resection or reduction of redundant inner prepuce\n  Excising the dysplastic dartos muscle\n  Recreation of the peno-pubic and penoscrotal angle by attaching shaft dermis to Buck’s fascia at 4 and 8 o’clock\n  Penile shaft coverage–most techniques differ in the tissue used to cover the penile shaft. This can be achieved by utilising penile skin, the redundant inner prepuce or a combination of the two.\n\n\nIt is our preference to use the anatomical approach as we have had good outcomes in our experience (Figure 8),52,53\n\n \nFigure 8 Inconspicuous penis secondary to penoscrotal fusion and poorly defined peno-pubic angle. (b) penis exposed on examination. (c) Surgical incisions marked. (d) Final result with the penile shaft covered by skin, pubic and scrotal angles created by securing dermis to Buck’s fascia at 4 and 8 o’clock.\n\nComplications\n\nShort term postoperative complications are hematoma, wound dehiscence and penile / scrotal oedema. Medium to long term complications include the need for redo surgery due to lymphoedema leading to excessive inner preputial skin, meatal stenosis and retraction of the penis,3,42,46,52,54\n\nSuggested Follow-Up and Outcomes\n\nGiven that some of the complications have been reported later in life, long term follow up for these patients is recommended. Shalaby and Cascio reported a median follow up of 17 to 61 months.40\n\nConclusions\n\nCongenital penile conditions are uncommon, therefore, referral to a pediatric urologist for a correct diagnosis and management is recommended.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Surgical correction is recommended for congenital penile curvature greater than 20 degrees\n  A step-wise approach with protection of neurovascular structures and preservation of urethral plate is preferred when repairing penile curvature (without hypospadias)\n  Consider correction of penile torsion greater than 45 degrees\n  Excision of the dysplastic dartos and skin fixation to Buck’s fascia are key steps when correcting a congenital megaprepuce\n  Limit skin excision until adequate coverage of the penile shaft is ensured\n  Initial nonoperative management is preferred for the concealed penis\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Mingin G, Baskin LS.

        "content": "Embryology\n\nThe embryology of the external male genitalia is a complex process. Before the ninth week of gestation, the development of the external genitalia is similar in both sexes. During the 9 to 13 weeks of gestation, testosterone production by Leydig cells, its conversion to Dihydrotestosterone (5α-reductase enzyme) and interaction with androgen receptors will result in the normal differentiation of the genital tubercle, folds and swelling.\n\nAndrogen stimulation causes elongation of the genital tubercle as well as fusion of the urethral folds creating the urethra from proximal to distal. The prepuce forms between the 13th and 18th week of gestation overlapping with the development of the urethra. The preputial folds move from the base of the shaft distally until its fusion with the glans creating the midline raphae. Normal subsequent desquamation of the epithelial fusion between the glans and the prepuce will allow foreskin separation and future retraction.1\n\nPhimosis\n\nPhimosis is the inability to retract the prepuce exposing the glans. Physiologic phimosis exists because of natural adhesions between the inner preputial skin and the glans and in some cases because of the presence of a constrictive ring (Figure 1). Normal separation is produced by the normal accumulation of epithelial debris called smegma and intermittent erections during the first years of life.\n\n\nFigure 1 Physiologic Phimosis in a 1-year-old boy.\n\nPhysiologic phimosis reduces with age: only 10% will remain with this condition by 3 years and less than 1% by 17 years of age. Primary phimosis commonly resolves spontaneously during childhood.1,2\n\nIt is important to differentiate phimosis from glandular adhesions (gland-preputial adhesions) which are attachments between the inner prepuce to the glans. They can also be secondary, traditionally after a circumcision, between the incision line and the glans. Physiologic adhesions will resolve spontaneously due to epithelial separation and erections during the childhood. In patients with asymptomatic preputial adhesions manual retraction should be avoided. Uncommonly, persistent adhesions in older patients can be lysed in the office after the application of topical analgesics.1,2\n\nSecondary phimosis may result from different causes like forced and traumatic retractions with secondary scar formation or the presence of balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) (Figure 2). Prevention of secondary phimosis by avoiding forceful retraction should be advocated during the consult.\n\n\nFigure 2 Balanitis Xeroticans obliterans.\n\nDifferent grading systems have been proposed to stratify the severity of the phimosis. One of them is the one proposed by Sookpotarom et al, which goes from a grade 0 with a complete and full retraction to a grade with no retraction (grade 5) (Figure 3).3\n\n\nFigure 3 Phimosis retraction grading scale by Sookpotarom et al.\n\nConditions related with the uncircumcised penis are shown next.\n\nBalanitis and Posthitis\n\nThese are inflammation process of the glans and foreskin, respectively, secondary to a poor hygiene in a phimotic patient. These conditions often occur simultaneously. A meticulous hygiene is the cornerstone of prevention. History of these episodes should encourage an enhanced preputial management.\n\nParaphimosis\n\nIt is the entrapment of the prepuce behind the glans, producing pain, swelling, edema and even necrosis of the foreskin if it is not reduced in time (See later paraphimosis).\n\nUTI\n\nPhimosis causes inner preputial skin and perimeatal colonization by uropathogens increasing the risk of UTI. Circumcision reduces this risk of UTI, with a relative risk of 4.5 in uncircumcised versus circumcised infants &lt; 1 month of age, and relative risk of 3.7 during the first year of life. Calculated number to treat is more than 100 to prevent one UTI, but this number reduces to 4 in boys with dilated vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (grade 3–5). Patients with more severe phimosis have also an increased prevalence of UTI compared with patients with mild grade of phimosis.4,5 Circumcision should be considered as an option in patients with VUR to reduce the risk of UTI by the American Urological Association.4\n\nCancer\n\nPhimosis has been described as a significant risk factor for penile carcinoma.1\n\nTreatment\n\nIn asymptomatic patients with physiologic phimosis active management should start after 2-3 years of age or according to the caregiver preference.2 Medical or surgical management of phimosis should be encouraged in some situations like: posthitis, balanitis, secondary phimosis, BXO or recurrent UTIs.\n\nMedical Treatment with Topical Corticosteroids\n\nCombined preputial management with the use of topical corticosteroid and manual retraction has shown high rate of success.2 Betamethasone cream (0.05%) is one of the most frequently used topical treatment in symptomatic or persistent primary phimosis with no pathologic changes of the prepuce. The physiologic mechanism is believed to be secondary to improvement in the preputial skin elasticity.\n\nThe European Urological Association recommends the use of topical corticosteroids in case of physiologic phimosis persistence with an 80% success rate and a 17% recurrence rate.2 The most common protocol is ointment administration twice a day for a minimum period of 4 to 8 weeks.\n\nNeonatal Circumcision\n\nElective circumcision during the neonatal period is a controversial topic of discussion. The American Academics of Pediatrics, in the Task Force published in 2012, emphasized that routine circumcision should not be recommended for all male newborn, but the benefits are sufficient to justify the access to this procedure for families who consider it.1\n\nOne of the most important points when this kind of circumcision is performed is the analgesia and local anesthesia. Different options are recommended like topical anesthetic, dorsal penile nerve block or a penile ring block. Several techniques and devices have been developed to facilitate this procedure like the Gomco Clamp, the Mogen Clamp and the Plastibell device.\n\nIt is imperative not to perform neonatal circumcision in patients with other urological conditions that will require an intact prepuce for their surgical correction in the future, as hypospadias. In order to exclude these kinds of anomalies, proper genital examination with a complete separation of the prepuce from the glans should be performed before the procedure.\n\nBalanitis Xerotica Obliterans\n\nBXO (also named as lichen sclerosus) is a chronic inflammatory disease which can affect the foreskin, glans and urethra. The name derives from the three components of the disease, which are balanitis (chronic inflammation of the glans penis), xerotic (abnormally dry appearance of the lesion) and obliterans (association of occasional endarteritis).6\n\nThe reported incidence is 0.4 cases/1000 boys per year and the published prevalence of BXO in phimotic patients varies between 9 and 50%. The average age at presentation has been reported to be 8.9 - 10.6 years with a peak incidence between 9 and 11 years of age.7,8,9\n\nIn a recent publication by Filho et al, BXO was diagnosed histologically in 32% of phimotic patients with no clinical suspected BXO after circumcision. The degree of phimosis was no correlated with the presence of BXO ^7,\\ 9^.\n\nThe diagnosis is mostly clinical. In mild cases with BXO, areas of greyish white discoloration on the glans or the inner layer of the foreskin can be found (Figure 2). As this condition progresses, the skin becomes inelastic with whitish discoloured plaques along with progressive fibrous phimosis. In more severe cases, ulceration and involvement of the meatus and urethra can be found.6,9\n\nMost pediatric patients are asymptomatic but some of them described dysuria or episodes of urinary retention and prepuce ballooning. The diagnosis is confirmed via histology revealing hyperkeratosis and atrophy of the basal layer of the epidermis with loss of elastic fibbers and collagen alterations with inflammatory infiltration.\n\nEtiology of this disease is still unknown. There is evidence that supports an underlying autoimmune mechanism. The lesions are histologically characterized by an abundance of infiltrating, auto reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes and impaired metabolism of extracellular matrix. Also, autoantibodies to extracellular matrix protein have been detected in serum of affected patients. Infectious causes, genetic predisposition, chronic irritation through urine exposure and hormonal influences are other postulated theories.6\n\nBXO Management\n\nThe most accepted and recommended treatment for BXO is circumcision which can be a definitive treatment in many cases (Figure 4). However, a significant number of centres are performing foreskin conservative surgery such as a preputioplasty, as a less aggressive surgical option. Wilkinson et al reported their results comparing boys with BXO treated with preputioplasty combined with injections of triamcinolone in the lesions intraoperatively against those ones treated with circumcision. During the follow up, 19% of circumcised boys required subsequent meatal surgery, compared to 6% of those who underwent preputioplasty. The success rate of the conservative surgery reported was 81%.10 Recently Green et al published a similar study comparing circumcision and preputioplasty in patients with BXO reporting no significant difference in meatal adjunct procedure rate, re-intervention rate postoperative infection or secondary haemorrhage between preputioplasty and circumcision group of patients. They conclude that preputioplasty with intralesional steroids may be a valid first-line operative treatment for BXO.11\n\n\nFigure 4 Surgical circumcision: (a) Skin incision is performed under the phimotic ring (b) Inner prepuce dissected from the outer prepuce (c) Excision of inner prepuce leaving a 5 mm mucosal collar (d) Suturing between the mucosal collar and skin with resorbable suture.\n\nA systematic review done by Folaranmi addressing the proposal of topical corticosteroid as an alternative to circumcision found that the average success rate of response was 35% for topical treatment in patients with BXO. The only prospective double blind randomized controlled trial that was included in this review demonstrated that no single patient with BXO responded to topical corticosteroids and all required circumcision.9\n\nUse of topic immunosuppressant such as tacrolimus has also been described. Ebert et al reported that application of tacrolimus 0.1% ointment after circumcision resulted in recurrence in 9%, which was successfully treated with a new cycle of the drug. They conclude that this therapy is an option after surgery if there is a risk of complicated outcome caused by meatal or glandular involvement.6\n\nWhen meatal involvement with BXO is detected, an endoscopy should be performed to determine the extension of the inflammatory process. A meatoplasty combined with topical corticoids or immunosuppressants is mandatory in these cases.\n\nIn some patients, especially with history of recurrent meatal stenosis or poor response with the local treatment, reconstructive surgeries using buccal mucosa graft should be considered.6\n\nComplications\n\nThe complication rate of circumcision has been reported between 0.2% to 5%. Complications can occur immediately after the procedure or many years later. The most frequent complication described is bleeding which is more common in older children. Although compression will be effective for control this complication in most of the cases, cauterization might be needed in a few of them (Figure 5).1\n\n\nFigure 5 Postoperative hematoma. Bleeding is the most common complication after circumcision.\n\nExcessive skin removal after circumcision can produced a trapped penis from a cicatricial scar. It can be treated with betamethasone in conjunction with manual retraction as a first option. In some cases, relaxation incisions or formal repair with skin flaps might be necessary.\n\nMeatal stenosis almost only occurs in patients after circumcision, and it is consequence of a local inflammatory reaction and cicatrix formation. Patients with a suspected meatal stenosis can complain of penile pain at the beginning of the micturition and/or a narrow urinary stream.\n\nParaphimosis\n\nParaphimosis is a urological emergency which affects uncircumcised males where the penile foreskin is retracted behind the coronal sulcus resulting in strangulation of the glans (Figure 6). If it is not reduced in time, the retracted foreskin can cause preputial and glans edema, venous congestion, and finally necrosis and gangrene of the glans. This condition may occur at any age, but it is more common among adolescents with a reported incidence of 0.7% in uncircumcised boys.12,13,14\n\n\nFigure 6 Paraphimosis.\n\nManagement consists in reducing penile and glans edema followed by retracting the foreskin back over the glans to its anatomical position. Before attempting any manoeuvre, it is very important to achieve adequate analgesia. Local anaesthetics commonly utilized are 2% lidocaine gel or EMLA cream (2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine). Oral or intravenous narcotics can be used in combination topical anaesthetics to achieve optimal pain control.\n\nSeveral non-invasive techniques have been described to reduce paraphimosis. When conservative measures fail, more invasive methods can be employed (Figure 7).\n\n\nFigure 7 Paraphimosis management algorithm.\n\nNon-invasive techniques:\n\n\n  Manual reduction: First, circumferential pressure is applied with a gloved hand to the distal part of the penis for several minutes to reduce swelling. After a few minutes of compression, both thumbs are placed compressing on the glans, while counter-traction is applied on the foreskin just proximal to the tight constrictive band. This technique can be facilitated by applying ice over the zone some minutes before the maneuver is started.\n  Compression wraps: a flexible self-adhering bandage is wrapped around the penis starting at the glans and removed after 5 to 20 min. The wrap generates constant gentle pressure pushing fluid proximally back underneath the tight constrictive band of tissue. If spontaneous reduction does not occur, gentle manual reduction can be employed.\n  Osmotic methods: a substance with a high solute concentration is used on the surface of the penis and foreskin reducing the edema of the tissues and facilitating the reduction. Soaked gauzes are wrapped around the edematous prepuce, with minimal intermittent hand compression for 1 to 2 hours. Several substances have been used for osmotic reduction of paraphimosis: glycerine magnesium sulphate, granulated sugar, 50% dextrose solution and 20% Mannitol solution.\n\n\nInvasive methods:\n\n\n  Puncture technique: A 26-gauge needle is used to make approximately 20 puncture holes in the prepuce reducing edema to permit reduction.15,16\n  Penile Aspiration: a tourniquet is applied in the shaft of the penis and then a 20-gauge needle is inserted parallel to the urethra to aspirate 3 to 12 ml of blood from the glans. This procedure reduces the volume of the glans to facilitate manual reduction.16\n  Hyaluronidase injections: 1 ml of 150 units/mL of hyaluronidase is injected through 2 or 3 sites into the prepuce. Hyaluronidase breaks down the viscous hyaluronic acid in the extracellular fluid and facilitates dissipation of oedema so the foreskin can then be gently retracted over the glans.\n  Preputioplasty: the constricting band is identified and a 1–2 cm dorsal longitudinal incision is performed. Release of the constricting band permits reduction of glandular edema so the foreskin can be reduced. The incision is then sutured in a transverse fashion with non-continuous reabsorbable sutures (Figure 8).15,17\n\n\n\nFigure 8 Preputioplasty.\n\nInconspicuous Penis\n\nIt is a penile anomaly where a penis with a normal length (from the tip of the glans to the pubis) and shaft diameter, appears smaller. Different entities are included in this definition as buried penis, trapped penis or webbed penis ^1,\\ 18^.\n\nBuried Penis\n\nIt is a normal penis hidden by the suprapubic fat pad. It is also called concealed or hidden penis\n\nSeveral different categories have been described according to the cause of concealing:\n\n\n  A congenital form with a lack of fixation between the skin and the base of the penis resulting in tenting. Its embryological origin is believed to be secondary from a failure of separation of the migrational planes during the development of the male external genitalia. This anomaly results in penile corporal tethered to the deep fascia and the scrotum located high in the groin (Figure 9).\n  Two different sub-categories can be easily identified based on the presence or not of megaprepuce which is an association of a phimotic ring with a major ballooning of the inner prepuce during micturition (Figure 10). This phenomenon can cause some degree of discomfort to the patient. The hemispheric tumefaction is also named as preputial bladder and it is usually diagnosed by the parents during the first months of life who need to compress it manually to allow the exit of the urine through the phimotic orifice.\n  An acquired form due to obesity (Figure 9). This one should be differentiated from the transient form in the early childhood that resolves with increased age and deambulation\n  A cicatrized form secondary to penile surgeries like circumcision.\n\n\n\nFigure 9 Different forms of buried penis: (a) Congenital with megaprepuce (b) Secondary to obesity\n\nAn important step in the physical examination is to differentiate this entity from a true micropenis which has an abnormal stretched penile length.\n\n\nFigure 10 Megaprepuce with ballooning of the inner prepuce during micturition.\n\nManagement\n\nIn patients with buried penis secondary to obesity, treatment should be first focused in losing weight with a diet and exercise program provided by the primary care provider.\n\nPhysiologic or secondary phimosis in symptomatic patients with this condition should be actively managed with topical corticosteroids and manual traction. In those patients where this treatment is ineffective, an elective repair should be planned by the age of 6 months or older.\n\nStandard circumcision should be avoided in this group of patients because of the poor cosmesis and the need of further procedures in the future.\n\nVarious surgical correction techniques of this malformation have been described, all of them with the same goals:\n\n\n  To remove the stenotic preputial ring relieving voiding symptoms\n  To restore the penopubic and penoscrotal angles\n\n\nThe main difference between these techniques results in how to cover the penile shaft skin deficiency which is a common feature in these patients.\n\nSurgical techniques using penile skin (Figure 11):\n\n\n  Dorsal neurovascular bundle infiltration or caudal blocking with bupivacaine is performed depending on the anesthesiologist and surgeon preference.\n  The first step is retraction of the skin which can be obtained with a limited circumferential incision at the narrow ring of the outer prepuce (Figure 11 b).\n  A traction suture is placed on the glans to facilitate the dissection.\n  The preputial skin and Dartos’s tunica are dissected off the Bucks’s fascia freeing the penile shaft from its abnormal attachments.\n  A vertical incision is made in the ventral part of the preputial skin allowing a better exposure and dissection at the base of the penis near to the pubic bones.\n  The inner prepuce is resected completely leaving only a 5 mm mucosal cuff under the glans (Figure 11 c-d).\n  One of the most important steps is to use at least 3 anchoring sutures (at 3, 9 and 12 o’clock positions) between the skin and the Buck’s fascia to create the penopubic angle. We prefer non absorbable sutures like Polypropylene 5-0.\n  A Ventral transverse incision at the level of the penoscrotal junction allows the scrotal skin to be mobilized caudally and reconfigure the penoscrotal angle after is closed in a vertical way (Figure 12 h-i).\n  A compression dressing is left for a week to prevent wound edema and bleeding.\n  In the anatomical approach described by Smeulders et al, a longitudinal ventral and a curved incision in the penoscrotal limit line are made. Then a deep dissection of the penis close to Buck’s fascia is carried out and the redundant inner prepuce is removed close to the sulcus. A dorsal quadrilateral skin flap is thinned and anchored to the Buck’s fascia and then wrapped around the penis and sutured to the mucosal cuff. The ventral incision is sutured in a transverse way creating the penoscrotal angle.18\n\n\n\nFigure 11 Surgical reconstruction technique of buried penis with megaprepuce using penile skin: (b) Outer prepuce skin incision and retraction of the phimotic prepuce (c-d) Excision of the inner prepuce (a V shaped ventral mucosa is left in place for an eventual skin defincency) (e-f) Anchoring non-absorbable sutures (at 3, 9 and 12 o’clock) creating penopubic angle (g) Dorsal skin Byars flap are used to wrap the penis shaft (h-i) Ventral incision is performed to create penoscrotal angle (j) Final appearance.\n\nSurgical Techniques Using the Inner Prepuce\n\nThe concept of covering the shaft with the inner prepuce was first described by Donahue and Keating in 1986. The unfurling techniques facilities the reconstruction without tension using the redundant inner prepuce which will acquire a foreskin appearance in the future.\n\nIn the publication by Ruiz et al, a simplified approach of this malformation was proposed. Using Donahue’s inner prepuce concept, a fixation of the outer prepuce to the Buck’s fascia is created and the unfurled and tailored inner prepuce is used to cover the penile shaft.19\n\nOn the other hand, Rod et al highlights the importance of reducing the inner prepuce in length and circumference to avoid an unesthetic appearance. They also described the importance of removing the subcutaneous tissue of the inner prepuce to reduce the probability of local lymphedema.20\n\nThe ventral V plasty is a combined technique where a V shaped incision is performed in the ventral inner preputial layer. This preputial layer will be leaved in place to be interposed and facilitate the skin closure in the ventral part of the shaft (Figure 12).21\n\n\nFigure 12 Ventral V plasty in an older patient with a severe ventral skin deficiency.\n\nA two staged approach was also proposed, where a first limited preputioplasty is performed to relieve the urinary flow obstruction. This approach preserves the preputial skin and allows physiologic remodeling while the patient grows. If a second procedure is needed, it will be scheduled after toilet training.\n\nWebbed Penis\n\nIt is a congenital condition where the scrotal skin extends to the ventral part of the penis. It is also called penoscrotal fusion. It is asymptomatic and produces an abnormal appearance of the ventral surface of the penis.\n\nThe surgical correction consists in a transversal skin incision on the web, creating a separation between the penis and the scrotum which is closed in a vertical fashion.1,21\n\n\n  \n  [Video 1](#video-1){:.video-link}.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nUrogynecologic complaints are commonly encountered in any pediatrician’s practice. Investigation of those complaints may uncover a variety of problems, ranging from benign to pathologic and from behavioral to congenital. Often, genital and urologic complaints in girls are inseparable, and some gynecologic concerns warrant evaluation of the urologic tract as well. In this chapter, we cover some of the more common urogynecologic problems that a clinician may encounter in his or her practice.\n\nSkene’s Gland Cysts\n\nSkene’s, or paraurethral glands are the female counterpart to the male prostate gland. Arising laterally in the distal urethra, they may become obstructed, resulting in a cyst. While more common in adults, they may occur in young girls as well.1 On physical exam, a thin-walled, tense cystic mass may be seen bulging from one side or the other of the urethral meatus. This may be differentiated from urethral prolapse, which results in circumferential bulge from the meatus, or prolapsed ureterocele, which is a cystic mass bulging from the lumen of the urethral meatus. Diagnosis may be made on physical exam alone, but in cases where urinary tract obstruction or ureterocele need to be ruled out, ultrasound may be obtained. Management is typically conservative, as most will spontaneously regress.2 Less commonly, surgical excision may be required.1,2\n\nBartholin Gland Cysts\n\nBartholin glands in females correspond to the bulbourethral glands in males and are found bilaterally in the labia minora at 4 and 8 o’clock.3 This is a mucus-secreting gland, aiding in vaginal lubrication. When obstructed, a cyst may form. Again, these are more common in adults, but they may be noted in children. Incidence increases with age until menopause.4 Exam will reveal a bulge or cystic structure on the lateral wall of the vulva, deep to the bulbospongiosus muscle. Again, the preferred management is conservative.2\n\n\nFigure 1 Bartholin gland cyst in young girl with cystic mass arising from left labial wall\n\nProlapsed Ureterocele\n\nA ureterocele is a saccular outpouching of the distal ureter through the muscular wall of the bladder. Many ureteroceles are found in the setting of duplicated renal collecting system. Hydronephrosis may result due to obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux. Indeed, about 50% of ureteroceles will have ipsilateral reflux and about 25% will be associated with reflux on the contralateral side. For that reason, voiding cystourethrogram is a crucial step in the workup of a ureterocele.2 With the advent of prenatal ultrasound screening, many ureteroceles are discovered in the workup for perinatal hydronephrosis. Depending on the size of the outpouching, the ureterocele may prolapse through the urethra, particularly in females, which will appear as a smooth, mucosal-covered mass bulging from the lumen of the urethra.5 Discovery should result in prompt referral for treatment, of which the mainstay is surgical incision and/or excision.6,7,8 In some more severe cases, bladder neck reconstruction and/or ureteral reimplantation may be required.2\n\n\nFigure 2 Prolapsed ureterocele with catheter in place\n\nImperforate Hymen\n\nIn normal neonatal development, the hymen, thin epithelial membrane, should spontaneously rupture. If it fails to do so, the result is an imperforate hymen, which commonly presents as a pubertal girl with amenorrhea and cyclic abdominal pain.9 Patients may also present as neonates due to ongoing circulation of maternal estrogen. This causes production of cervical mucus, whose buildup in the vagina and uterus results in hydrocolpos or hydrometrocolpos.2 Presentation can vary, including complaints of perineal mass, urinary retention,10 acute abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis,11 or chronic abdominal pain.12 Hydronephrosis has also been observed.13,14 On physical exam, the classic finding is a perineal bulge. Incision of the hymen is the definitive treatment, but clinicians should also be alert to the possibility of urinary retention, caused by mass effect on the bladder outlet with resulting obstruction, and place urethral catheter in that scenario.2,9 Clinicians should also avoid the temptation to simply aspirate or make a small incision for symptomatic relief, as pelvic inflammatory disease has been documented and recurrence is likely.5,9\n\n\nFigure 3 Imperforate hymen with bulging membrane\n\nLabial Adhesions\n\nLabial adhesions refer to the fusion of the labia minora. It typically starts at the posterior fourchette and progresses anteriorly to varying degrees. These are thought to occur due to low circulating estrogen levels in prepubertal girls.5 In many girls, the adhesions are asymptomatic, but they may also present with vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation, pain with wiping, or post-void dribbling, which occurs due to pooling of urine behind the adhesions. Asymptomatic adhesions can be managed conservatively, as 80% will resolve spontaneously within a year. Parents should be counseled on good perineal hygiene.2,5,15 The mainstay of medical treatment remains topical estrogen cream, which has been proven to be superior to topical emollients.5,16 Less commonly, mechanical separation under local or general anesthesia may be required. Parents should be informed that recurrence is common, up to 15%, and should be educated on the importance of regular separation of labia after successful treatment to prevent that recurrence..2,5,15 Of note, parents should avoid aggressive separation of the labia as gentle application of pressure when applying topical emollients is enough to prevent recurrence and not traumatic.\n\n\nFigure 4 Examples of labial adhesions\n\n\nFigure 5. Examples of labial adhesions\n\nUrethral Prolapse\n\nUrethral prolapse presents as a circumferential bulge from the urethral meatus. It is a rare condition that is seen more frequently in black girls, for unknown reasons, and post-menopausal women. The exact incidence is not well known, as many patients likely have little-to-no symptoms and never seek care. Estrogen deficiency has been proposed as a possible etiology. This can lead to atrophy of the distal urethra, and, with increased intra-abdominal pressure, the distal urethra may prolapse. It can also be seen after peri-urethral injections. The exposed urethral mucosa may become inflamed and friable, resulting in symptoms such as pain, dysuria, discharge, and bleeding or hematuria. Medical management with topical estrogen cream and sitz baths is preferred. Topical steroids have also been used. Excision of the prolapsed portion of the urethra is reserved for more extreme cases..2,5,17 In majority of the cases, ensuring good bowel habits to minimize severe straining is key to a more long-term success without any further recurrences.\n\n\nFigure 6 Circumferential prolapse of the urethra in a young girl\n\nLichen Sclerosus\n\nWhile lichen sclerosus stereotypically affects adults, particularly middle-aged women, it can also affect young girls, with a peak incidence noted at ages 4-6 that accounts for 7-15% of all cases.18 Presenting symptoms include pruritus, vulvar discomfort or discharge, bleeding, dysuria, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Physical exam reveals white, shiny skin plaques. The stereotypical configuration is “figure-of-8”, involving the vulva and perianal region. Treatment involves strong topical steroids, with the goal of preventing atrophy and introital narrowing in addition to symptomatic relief. While there is some association with malignancy in adults, this has not been observed in children. There is thus little role for biopsy in children. However, long-term, regular follow-up is important.2,18\n\nMüllerian Agenesis\n\nMüllerian agenesis is the failure of the Müllerian duct to develop into the fallopian tube, uterus, cervix and upper 1/3 of the vagina, resulting in varying absence of those structures. The most common presentation is amenorrhea. On physical exam, varying amounts of vaginal atresia may be observed. Differential diagnosis should include disorders of sexual development with 46,XY karyotype, such as complete androgen insensitivity or 5-alpha reductase deficiency. Therefore, workup should involve karyotype and pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for uterus, ovaries, and cervix.5 It may be associated with renal abnormalities, such as renal agenesis, so renal ultrasound should also be obtained. Once diagnosis is confirmed, surgical reconstruction can involve vaginal dilation, vaginoplasty, or even creation of a neovagina with bowel.2\n\nVulvovaginitis\n\nVulvovaginitis is a term used to cover a wide variety of presentations of inflammation of the vulva and vagina. Vulvovaginitis is one of the most common gynecological complaints in our pediatric female population.19 There is a wide range of etiologies for vulvovaginitis, and management depends on the underlying cause. Furthermore, as girls age and their physiologies change, the prevalence of certain etiologies changes. In young girls, a hypoestrogenic environment results in thin vaginal and vulvar epithelium with few lactobacillus species, resulting in a more neutral pH. With puberty, increasing estrogen stimulates a more protective environment, with more mature epithelium and a more acidic pH. Female anatomy is also important. The proximity of the vagina to anus can lead to fecal flora into the vagina, especially in young children and children with bowel and bladder dysfunction. As such, the clinician should pay attention to bowel and bladder habits, paying particular attention to signs of constipation. The clinician should remember that diarrhea may be evidence of encopresis and consider KUB to evaluate for constipation if any evidence of bowel or bladder dysfunction is present. Other contributing anatomic and behavioral features in the female child include lack of labial fat pad or pubic hair, small labia minora, and tendency to explore their bodies with transfer of respiratory bacteria to the perineum.20 Foreign bodies, local irritants such as tight underwear, bath soaps, laundry detergents, and atopic skin conditions, such as other allergies or eczema, should be considered in all age ranges. Sexual abuse and sexually transmitted diseases are more common etiologies in older, adolescent girls but should also be considered in all age ranges. Evaluation starts with a thorough history, but the mainstay of diagnosis is a good physical exam. Normally, pulling the labia majora forward and out, rather than simply spread apart, gives great visualization for the external genitalia, including the labia minora, urethra, and vaginal introitus. Management strategy is dependent on the potential causes. If yeast or bacterial infections or sexually transmitted infections are suspected, those should be treated appropriately with antimicrobials. However, majority of the cases are due to nonspecific etiology and good hygiene methods are recommended.19 Possible offending agents, such as tight underwear or irritating soap should be discontinued. Bowel and bladder dysfunction should be addressed, typically with relief of constipation by oral bowel regimen or bowel cleanout, as necessary.\n\nReferences\n\n\nFoster J, Lemack G, Zimmern P.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nBladder exstrophy (BE) is a devastating congenital abnormality of the urinary tract in which infants are born with the urinary bladder extruded through their abdominal wall, a urethra that is open dorsally, and significant secondary abnormalities of the genitalia. It is widely regarded as the most surgically challenging and complex congenital disorder of the urinary tract.1 BE varies in degree of severity and exists on a continuum described as the bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC).2 The incidence of the BEEC is ~1 in 10,000.2\n\nCloacal exstrophy (CE) is on the severe end of the BEEC spectrum. CE is a rare congenital disorder with an incidence of 1 in 200,000–400,000 live births.3,4 Common associated anomalies include omphalocele, bladder exstrophy, imperforate anus, and spinal dysraphism.4 Additional features include a midline plate of exstrophied cecum flanked by 2 bladder halves, a segment of ileum prolapsing from the cecal plate and a blind ending, rudimentary hindgut accompanied by an imperforate anus.4\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum lies epispadias. Epispadias is most commonly present as a component of BE and CE, but when epispadias occurs alone, in the absence of BE and CE it is regarded as the least severe variant of the BEEC. Epispadias is defined by an incomplete fusion of the dorsal urethra.5 This ranges from a mild glanular defect in a covered penis to the penopubic variety that extends proximally to the bladder neck and results in complete incontinence in males or females.5 Interestingly, the first described case of epispadias is attributed to the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (CE 610–641).6 Isolated male epispadias is a rare anomaly, with a reported incidence of 1 in 117,000 males.6 Isolated female epispadias is even more rare with an incidence of 1 in 484,000 female patients.6 In this chapter we will focus exclusively on female epispadias.\n\nIn 1928, Davis classified female epispadias into three categories based on severity. This classification system is still used today.7 In the lesser degree of epispadias the urethral orifice appears merely patulous. In intermediate epispadias the urethra is dorsally split along most of the urethra. In the most severe degree of epispadias the urethral cleft involves the entire length of the urethra and the sphincteric mechanism is rendered incompetent. Of note, the true prevalence of female epispadias may be higher than what is reported as in less severe cases the changes of the external genitalia may be minimal and if incontinence is not present patients go undiagnosed.8,9\n\nEmbryology\n\nOne of the leading theories of embryonic maldevelopment in exstrophy, proposed by Marshall and Muecke, is that the basic defect is an abnormal overdevelopment of the cloacal membrane during the fourth week of gestation, which prevents medial migration of the mesenchymal tissue and proper lower abdominal wall development. The timing of the rupture of this defective cloacal membrane is thought to determine the resulting variant.10 There is thought to be a failure of the cloacal membrane to be reinforced by ingrowth of mesoderm. The cloacal membrane is a bilaminar layer situated at the caudal end of the germinal disk that occupies the infraumbilical abdominal wall. Mesenchymal ingrowth between the ectodermal and endodermal layers of the cloacal membrane results in formation of the lower abdominal muscles and the pelvic bones. The cloacal membrane is subject to premature rupture, and if this results in a small infraumbilical defect, or the rupture occurs at a later stage in development then it is thought that epispadias will result, while in instances of larger defects or earlier rupture, BE or CE can result.10,11\n\nOther plausible theories concerning the cause of the exstrophy-epispadias complex exist. Abnormal development of the genital hillocks caudal to the normal position, with fusion in the midline\n\nbelow rather than above the cloacal membrane, has been embraced by other investigators.11,12 Another interesting hypothesis that remains controversial describes an abnormal caudal insertion of the body stalk, which results in a failure of interposition of the mesenchymal tissue in the midline.13 As a consequence of this failure, translocation of the cloaca into the depths of the abdominal cavity does not occur. A cloacal membrane that remains in a superficial infraumbilical position represents an unstable embryonic state with a strong tendency to disintegrate, which has been supported by the laboratory work of Thomalla et al.14,15 Another interesting theory is that maldevelopment of the bony pelvis, rather, is the inciting factor for the development of exstrophy. Beaudoin et al have suggested that lack of “rotation” of the pelvic ring primordium prevents structures attached to the pelvic ring from joining in the midline, allowing herniation of the bladder to occur.16\n\nEpidemiology\n\nComplete female epispadias is an extremely rare congenital defect, occurring in about 1/484,000 live births, much less frequently than BE, which is estimated to occur in 1/10,000 to 1/50,000.6 The male-to-female ratio of bladder exstrophy derived from multiple series is 2.3:1 and female epispadias is also less common than male epispadias which has a reported incidence of 1 in 117,000 males.17\n\nThe risk of recurrence of BE in a given family is approximately 1 in 100.18 Shapiro et al in a questionnaire identified the recurrence of BE and epispadias in only 9 of approximately 2,500 indexed cases.19 Shapiro et al determined that the risk of BE in the offspring of individuals with BE and epispadias is 1 in 70 live births, a 500-fold greater incidence than in the general population.17\n\nPathogenesis\n\nOur current understanding of the pathogenesis of epispadias is incomplete. Due to a scarcity of quality research, experts are still unsure of the embryologic origins and genetic mechanisms that give rise to epispadias. However, strides have been made in recent years with respect to identifying candidate genes in the BEEC, which would cover the development of isolated epispadias as well. von Lowtow et al assessed 169 individuals with BEEC (recruited largely from Europe, geo-ethnic genetic origin not reported).20 They identified several individuals with pathogenic copy number variants, including one with a previously reported duplication in 22q11. This region is also associated with 22q11 Deletion Syndrome (DiGeorge Syndrome), and CAKUT.21 A subsequent genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis combining 568 BEEC patients and 3,241 controls of European origin identified an association with a locus containing the transcriptional enhancer ISL1 (p = 2.22 × 10−08).22,23,24,25,26 Further functional and model studies reinforced a possible causal role for ISL1 in BEEC. For example, developmental biology models were used to clarify the location of ISL1 activity in the forming urinary tract.26 Genetic lineage analysis of ISL1-expressing cells by a lineage tracer mouse model showed ISL1-expressing cells in the urinary tract of mouse embryos.26\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nEven with modern ultrasound modalities, the prenatal diagnosis of BE is often difficult to delineate, and the prenatal diagnosis of isolated epispadias is nearly impossible.27 In 2012 Goyal et al. found that only 25% of cases of BEEC are diagnosed prenatally.27 Several groups have attempted to outline important criteria for the diagnosis of BE prenatally but there are no specific features for epispadias. They have found that for classic BE, the absence of a normal fluid-filled bladder on repeated examinations suggests the diagnosis, as does a mass of echogenic tissue on the lower abdominal wall.28,29 An umbilical cord insertion-to-genital tubercle length below the fifth percentile for gestational age also provides a quantitative measurement by which a BE diagnosis can be assessed.30 In a review of 25 prenatal ultrasound examinations with the subsequent birth of a newborn with BE, Gearhart et al made several observations:1 absence of bladder filling,2 a low-set umbilicus,3 widening pubis ramus,4 diminutive genitalia, and5 a lower abdominal mass that increased in size as the pregnancy progressed and as the intra-abdominal viscera increased in size.31 It is not hard to understand why the prenatal diagnosis of isolated epispadias is more difficult. Of those previously mentioned prenatal observations, only a low-set umbilicus, widened pubic ramus, and diminutive genitalia would potentially be present in the setting of isolated epispadias. All those findings would be less severe in the setting of isolated epispadias, and diminutive genitalia would not be applicable in the setting of isolated female epispadias.\n\nAs a result, the diagnosis of isolated female epispadias is generally made by physical exam postnatally. Changes to the external appearance of the genitalia may be minimal, particularly in cases of mild epispadias. Externally a genital defect marked by a bifid clitoris will be identified. The mons will be depressed in shape and coated by a smooth, glabrous area of skin. Beneath this area, there may be a moderate amount of subcutaneous tissue and fat, or the skin may be directly anterior and inferior to the surface of the symphysis pubis. The labia minora are usually poorly developed and terminate anteriorly at the corresponding half of the bifid clitoris, where there may be a rudiment of a preputial fold. The symphysis pubis is usually closed but may be separated by a narrow fibrous band. On separation of the labia, the urethral abnormality will be identified which can vary considerably depending on the degree of epispadias present. The urethral abnormality will range from a short distal defect to one that extends proximally to the bladder neck (Figure 1). The vagina and internal genitalia are usually normal. Because the external appearance changes may be minimal, some children are identified only because of persistent incontinence, and, in mild cases in which incontinence is not present, the diagnosis might never be made. That is the reason why the true prevalence of female epispadias may be higher than what is reported.8,9 Thus, isolated female epispadias always involves an anomaly of the urethra, but there can be coexisting abnormalities of the bladder neck that cannot be ignored when managing these patients. In more severe forms of female epispadias the bladder can be small and can be comparable to the bladders of patients with bladder exstrophy that has been closed, since there was no cycling of the bladder in utero. In fact, a third of all incontinent epispadias patients have a bladder capacity of less than 60 mL and the incidence of vesicoureteral reflux is 30% to 75%.32\n\n\nFigure 1 Severe cases of female epispadias. Penopubic epispadias in a newborn (A). Penopubic epispadias in a 4 year old (B).\n\nTreatment and Outcomes\n\nIn the female epispadias patient the goals of treatment are achievement of urinary continence, preservation of the upper urinary tracts, and reconstruction of functional and cosmetically acceptable external genitalia. In patients with mild epispadias who are dry and have only minimal changes to their external genitalia surgical reconstruction may not be necessary. For more severe forms of female epispadias surgical reconstruction is required to obtain continence and correct abnormalities of the external genitalia.\n\nHistorically, there were many operations reported to attempt to achieve continence in the epispadias group, but the results were disappointing. These procedures included transvaginal plication of the urethra and bladder neck, muscle transplantations, urethra twisting, cauterization of the urethra, bladder flap, and Marshall-Marchetti vesicourethral suspension.33,34,35,36 These procedures sought to increase urethral resistance, but did not correct incontinence as they did not attempt to normalize the anatomy of the urethra and bladder neck.\n\nAs previously mentioned, patients with distal epispadias without incontinence may not require any surgical intervention. In cases of proximal female epispadias we will often perform epispadias repair, and bladder neck reconstruction, with or without osteotomies at the same time (Figure 2). This is similar to the complete primary repair of exstrophy that we perform in BE cases and is generally performed between 3–6 months of life. We have found that the added resistance gained from epispadias repair and bladder neck reconstruction allows for bladder cycling and can often result in an increase in bladder capacity. These findings have been corroborated by other authors who have shown that primary closure of the epispadiac urethra in children with closed exstrophy was found to increase bladder capacity without causing hydronephrosis. This approach has been applied to male and female patients with epispadias.37,38,39\n\n\nFigure 2 Post-operative image of a patient with severe female epispadias status post epispadias repair and bladder neck reconstruction.\n\nContinence rates in females with isolated epispadias have been found to be between 67-87.5%.6,32,40 The mean interval after reconstruction until continence has been quoted to be between 18 and 30 months.6,41 There have also been rare reports of patients have delayed complete continence several years after reconstruction.32 The extended delay in achieving continence has been postulated to be secondary to increased pelvic muscular development over time and especially after the hormonal changes during puberty.32\n\nComplications\n\nThe surgical management of epispadias is notoriously challenging and, as a result, complications are not uncommon. Potential complications following the repair of the epispadiac urethra include urethrocutaneous fistula, meatal stenosis and urethral strictures. For patients who require a bladder neck procedure the importance of close follow up cannot be overstated. When the outlet resistance of the bladder is tightened, patients are at risk of developing a high-pressure bladder due to the bladder contracting to fight against the high resistance, that places their upper tracts as risk. It is thus critical for surgeons to follow patients very closely following reconstruction in order to identify new onset hydronephrosis or other signs of a high-pressure system early. This is especially important in patients who had small, non-compliant bladders pre-operatively, although this is very rare in epispadias. Additionally, following a bladder neck procedure, patients may still suffer from incontinence and may require additional procedures to achieve continence.\n\nIn patients with severe forms of proximal epispadias bilateral iliac osteotomies may be required at the time of urologic reconstruction to take tension off of the closure by decreasing the pubic diastasis. Risks associated with bilateral iliac osteotomies include blood loss decreased perfusion to the lower extremities, and in very severe cases decreased perfusion to the clitoris. The decreased perfusion to the clitoris may occur when the pubic bones are brought together too tightly following osteotomies. Vesicocutaneous fistulas are also possible in patients who require bladder neck reconstruction. Interestingly, when Suson et al compared 22 girls with complete epispadias with 23 girls with classic BE they did not find a difference in number of surgical procedures, development of continence with or without the need for bladder neck reconstruction, or eventual need for continent urinary diversion.5\n\nSuggested Follow Up\n\nPatients with distal epispadias who void normally and have healthy upper tracts can often simply be monitored and potentially discharged from care after being followed for a period of time. Alternatively, patients with more severe forms of epispadias who undergo reconstruction should be followed throughout childhood and into adulthood. It is critical to transfer their care in adulthood to a transitional urologist who has experience in treating patients with complex congenital urologic anomalies.\n\nAs mentioned previously, patients who undergo epispadias repair and bladder neck reconstruction require very close follow up post operatively. Studies have shown that patients who undergo isolated bladder neck procedures without concomitant augmentation are at risk of developing elevated bladder pressures and subsequent upper tract deterioration. This has been shown to occur even when extensive pre-operative work up is performed to ensure safe pre-operative bladder pressures and compliance. Despite preoperative selection, there are significant changes in bladder dynamics and 40% of neurogenic bladder patients required subsequent augmentation.42 Thus, annual follow up with renal bladder ultrasounds is absolutely critical in these patients.\n\nConclusions\n\nIsolated female epispadias is an exceedingly rare condition and is regarded as the least severe variant of the BEEC. It varies from a mild distal defect that does not affect continence, to a complete phenotype which extends proximally to the bladder neck and results in complete incontinence.5 Similar to BE, proximal epispadias is widely regarded as one the most surgically challenging and complex congenital disorder of the urinary tract.1 Epispadias repair, bladder neck reconstruction, and even osteotomies may be required in the most severe forms. Many epispadias patients will require lifelong follow up with a urologist who has experience in caring for patients with complex urologic anomalies.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Epispadias is the least severe variant of the BEEC and is defined by an incomplete fusion of the dorsal urethra.\n  Complete female epispadias is an extremely rare congenital defect, occurring in about 1/484,000 live births, much less frequently than BE, which is estimated to occur in 1/10,000 to 1/50,000.\n  The diagnosis of isolated female epispadias is generally made by physical exam postnatally as diagnosis via prenatal imaging is not reliable.\n  The urethral abnormality can range from a short distal defect to one that extends proximally to the bladder neck\n  In the female epispadias patient the goals of treatment are achievement of urinary continence, preservation of the upper urinary tracts, and reconstruction of functional and cosmetically acceptable external genitalia.\n  In patients with mild epispadias who are dry and have only minimal changes to their external genitalia surgical reconstruction may not be necessary.\n  For more severe forms of female epispadias surgical reconstruction is required to obtain continence and correct abnormalities of the external genitalia.\n  Continence rates in females with isolated epispadias have been found to be between 67-87.5%.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWeiss DA, Shukla AR, Borer JG, Sack BS, Kryger JV, Roth EB, et al..

        "title": "Cloacal Anomaly",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nAnorectal anomalies comprise a spectrum of congenital malformations involving the rectum and anus. Children with anorectal malformations (ARM) are often diagnosed with “imperforate anus” because there is no opening where the normal anal opening should be. This oversimplifies the underlying pathology which frequently involves the urogenital system, spine, and pelvic floor musculature. At one end of the spectrum are minor anomalies in which the anal canal is present, but the anus is anteriorly displaced or covered by perineal skin. With more severe malformations, the rectum fails to reach the perineum and instead connects to the genitourinary tract.\n\nThe most severe manifestation of anorectal malformation in girls is a cloacal malformation in which the rectum, urethra, and vagina join to form a single confluent channel which opens onto the perineum. Classically, the perineal opening in a cloaca will be anterior on the perineum, at the site where the urethra would normally open. Posterior cloacal anomalies are a rare variant in which the opening is posteriorly deviated, with the urogenital sinus inserting into or just anterior to an orthotopic rectum.1,2\n\nEmbryology and Epidemiology\n\nCloacal malformation occurs in approximately 1 in 25,000–50,000 live births. The embryological cause is incompletely understood, but involves failed division of the primitive cloaca by the urorectal septum and Rathke’s folds during early gestation.3 Anomalous cloacal septation is associated with abnormal development of other organ systems that form in close temporal and spatial proximity including vertebrae, ureters, kidneys, and Müllerian duct derivatives. When one child is born with an ARM, there is a 1% risk that future siblings will have an ARM.4\n\nIn cloacal malformation, the vagina, rectum, and urethra are combined into a single common channel. Hydrocolpos can develop when the vagina fills with urine and mucus, and the distended vaginal cavity can cause urinary tract obstruction via external compression of the ureters or bladder outlet. Patients with a long common channel (&gt; 3 cm) are more likely to have sacral dysplasia and additional congenital anomalies, poor rectal and urinary sphincter musculature, and are more likely to require more complex surgical reconstruction including vaginal reconstruction.\n\nPathogenesis and Associated Anomalies\n\nUrologic anomalies in patients with anorectal malformations are common and are broadly underappreciated. They are particularly prevalent in girls with cloacal malformation. Pediatricians, pediatric surgeons, and urologists must be aware of the high incidence of urologic comorbidity in these patients, and all patients should be screened for genitourinary anomalies. Reported rates of associated genitourinary anomalies in ARM patients vary widely from 18 to 85%.5 This variability can largely be attributed to differences in completeness of screening. Most series with active screening protocols report a prevalence of around 50% across all ARM types, with increasing rates of urologic anomalies in more severe ARM subtypes.6 Cloacal malformations are the most severe subtype of female anorectal malformation, and the vast majority of these patients will have genitourinary comorbidities (Table 1). This underscores the importance of including urologists as core member of the multidisciplinary team needed to care for patients with anorectal malformations.5,7\n\nTable 1 Prevalence of urologic anomalies in 712 children with anorectal malformations treated at the Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. The prevalence of most reported urologic anomalies increases with increasing severity of the ARM. In brackets, prevalence ranges are reported ranging from minor ARM (perineal) to severe ARM (long-channel cloaca in female, bladder neck fistula in male). Anomalies without differences across ARM type are denoted with an asterisk, and no range is reported. Lower urinary tract dysfunction and Müllerian anomalies were not included in this analysis.

Commonly seen anomalies include hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux, renal dysplasia, agenesis, duplication, and ectopic variants including simple renal ectopia, cross-fused ectopia, horseshoe kidneys, and ureteral ectopia. The pattern of upper urinary tract anomalies (along with male genital anomalies) from one recent robust single series study is summarized in Table 1.6\n\nIn addition to structural anomalies, it has been reported nearly 50% of girls with cloacal anomalies develop severe renal impairment. Consequently, early detection of renal impairment is critical, as is proactive monitoring and management of the lower urinary tract.8\n\nLower Urinary Tract Dysfunction\n\nBladder dysfunction is common among all patients with ARM. This is usually associated with a coexisting spinal anomaly, however some children will have innate bladder dysfunction with a normal bony sacrum and spinal cord.9,10 Particularly in cloacal malformation, acquired bladder dysfunction may result from neuromuscular damage during surgical repair of the anorectal malformation.11,12 While meticulous surgical technique and minimization of monopolar electrocautery is prudent, some neuromuscular damage may be unavoidable due to the more midline location of pelvic autonomic plexus in patients with ARM.13 While screening with uroflowmetry is likely adequate for patients with minor ARM and normal spinal imaging, we advocate all girls with cloacal anomalies undergo urodynamic evaluation.\n\nGenital Anomalies\n\nAnomalies of the female genital tract are less readily apparent on external examination, yet Müllerian abnormalities are very common among girls with ARM.14 Cloacal malformations are associated with a very high rates of anomalous internal genitalia, with reports ranging from 53 to 67%.15 Some degree of Müllerian duplication is commonly seen, ranging from vaginal septae to complete uterine and vaginal duplication. Müllerian structures may also be underdeveloped, and asymmetry in duplicated reproductive tracts in common. Delineating the Müllerian anatomy in girls with ARM is critical. Hydrocolpos is common and can lead to pain, obstructive uropathy, infection, and infertility. Clinicians must assess and treat hydrocolpos in newborns, in whom the vaginal fluid is primarily urine collecting in the reproductive tract, and again in pubertal patients after menarche, in whom menstrual products can collect in the vagina(s). Rates of menstrual obstruction are reported around 40%.8 In these patients, vaginal obstruction can be congenital or due to vaginal stricture, which is common following posterior sagittal anorectovaginourethroplasty (PSARVUP).14,16\n\nSpinal Anomalies\n\nApproximately one quarter to one third of patient with ARM will have associated vertebral or spinal cord pathology.17,18,19 Among patients with cloacal malformation specifically, small series suggest much higher rates of spinal anomalies (over 70%), though a recent large retrospective review reports 42% of these patients have spinal pathology.20,21 Common anomalies include spinal cord tethering, sacral hypoplasia, hemisacrum (which is associated with a presacral mass. Spinal pathologies can lead to urologic, neurologic, and orthopedic complications.17 Routine spinal imaging is standard of care, and children with spinal pathologies need to be monitored for neurogenic bladder.\n\nVACTERL Association\n\nMultiple syndromes and genetic disorders have been described which include anorectal malformations as a feature. The most significant of these is the VACTERL association, though many others have been described. VACTERL is an acronym for vertebral anomalies, anorectal anomalies, cardiac anomalies, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies. Most cases are sporadic rather than hereditary. Not all components of the VACTERL association are expressed in every patient. The most common are vertebral, anorectal, and renal abnormalities. To diagnose VACTERL/VACTER Syndrome, at least 3 of defects must be present.22 Other syndromes that may be commonly associated with ARMs include MURCS (Müllerian duct aplasia, renal aplasia, and cervicothoracic somite dysplasia), OEIS (omphalocele, exstrophy, imperforate anus, and spinal defects).23\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nPrenatal\n\nCloacal malformation can be diagnosed prenatally due to the increased incidence of concurrent anomalies and hydrocolpos. The advantage of prenatal diagnosis is two-fold; parents can be counseled, and arrangements can be made to deliver at a center familiar with neonatal management of anorectal malformations. Clues on prenatal ultrasound include dilated bowel, calcified meconium, lack of meconium in the rectum, hydrocolpos (usually identified as a pelvic cystic structure and a poorly visualized bladder), renal anomalies, neural tube defects, and absent radius, among others. Abnormalities of multiple systems may strengthen suspicion for VACTERL or another syndrome with anorectal anomalies. Some centers have pursued prenatal MRI in hopes of confirming the diagnosis, though this too is imperfect and is not the current standard of care.24,25\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nWhile prenatal diagnosis of cloacal malformation can be suspected on prenatal imaging, confirmation of the diagnosis is based on physical exam postnatally. When approaching the perineal and genital exam, urologists should evaluate the number and location of perineal openings as well as the gluteal cleft. In girls, there should be three separate perineal openings (urethra, vagina, anus), with the anal orifice centered within the anal sphincter complex and separated from the vagina by the perineal body. A single perineal orifice in a girl is pathognomonic for a cloaca and is typically found in the expected location of the urethra. There can be wide variations of the appearance of the perineum, but the single orifice is the critical finding on exam (Figure 1). A less common variant of cloacal malformation, called a posterior cloacal variant has a perineal opening more posterior where the vagina or anus would be located (Figure 2). Occasionally, prominent preputial skin will give the appearance clitoromegaly. In the absence of palpably enlarged corporal bodies, this should not prompt routine endocrinologic evaluation for intersex disorders.26\n\n\nFigure 1 Perineal photographs of girls with cloacal malformation. The anal opening is absent, and the single perineal opening located posterior to the clitoris, near the expected location of the urethra. Redundant preputial tissue is common.\n\n\nFigure 2 Posterior cloacal anomaly, with the single perineal opening posteriorly displaced toward the expected location of the anus.\n\nLabs and Imaging\n\nSubsequent workup focuses on evaluating potential associated anomalies.\n\nEchocardiogram\n\nThis is needed to evaluate structural cardiac anomalies, particularly prior to anesthesia.\n\nComplete Abdominal Ultrasound\n\nAssess for renal anomalies, urinary tract obstruction, hydrocolpos, and Müllerian duplication.\n\nSpinal Imaging\n\nA spinal ultrasound should be obtained, primarily to assess for tethered cord. Plan radiography is useful for assessing the sacrum following ossification of the coccyx. Anterior-posterior and lateral sacral x-rays may demonstrate sacral anomalies such as a hemisacrum and sacral hemivertebrae and allow for assessment of the degree of sacral hypoplasia. In general, more severe hypoplasia portends poorer continence outcomes.27 Measurement of the “sacral ratio” has been proposed as a prognostic indicator for bowel continence, but has not proven reliable as a predictor of urinary continence, development of neurogenic bladder, or need for intermittent catheterization.28\n\nFor patients with spinal anomalies, neurosurgical evaluation and spinal MRI should follow, and these patients need ongoing urologic monitoring for neurogenic bladder. Children who present after 3–4 months of age will need a spinal MRI, as ossification of the vertebral arches obscures the sonographic window.\n\nRenal Function Testing\n\nObtain serum creatinine to assess baseline renal function. Note that renal function assessment in children is imperfect, and renal immaturity in neonates may underestimate renal function, particularly in premature babies. Cystatin C is increasingly being used as a corollary to serum creatinine.\n\nAdditional imaging is commonly pursued as clinically indicated. In the setting of hydronephrosis due to hydrocolpos or bladder distension, a repeat renal ultrasound after hydrocolpos drainage should be obtained to confirm improvement of hydronephrosis. Renal scintigraphy or MR urography may be pursued if there is concern for poor renal drainage or to establish relative renal function. VCUG can screen for vesicoureteral reflux, though the role of routine preoperative voiding cystourethrogram is debatable and it may be difficult to blindly catheterize the bladder. Lastly, although there is a high incidence of abnormal urodynamic findings, urodynamics need not be pursued until after surgical reconstruction.\n\nPreoperative Planning\n\nThe remainder of the workup is spent defining the anatomy in preparation for surgical reconstruction.\n\nColostogram\n\nA high-pressure distal colostogram will define the level of the rectal fistula, evaluate the length of distal colon available for pull-through, and define the relationship of the rectum to the sacrum and coccyx. Following colostomy creation, a Foley catheter is inserted into the mucus fistula and the balloon is gently inflated to prevent leakage. Contrast is then instilled through the catheter to opacify the distal colon. The pressure of the instilled contrast must be adequate to overcome the tone of the levator muscles, and contrast must be water-soluble and isosmotic due to the rare risk of colon perforation. Alternatively, “invertogram” may be used to investigate the extent of the defect in anal or rectal atresia. The anus is marked with radioopaque marker, the baby is inverted such that air in the rectum rises to the highest point, and a lateral radiograph is taken. The distance between the air and the radioopaque marker indicates the distance from the rectum to the perineal skin.\n\nEndoscopy\n\nCystoscopy and vaginoscopy is essential to the preoperative planning for repair of a cloaca or urogenital sinus. This may be coordinated with diverting colostomy or another procedure to avoid unnecessary anesthesia. Endoscopy will define the length of the common channel and distance from the bladder neck to the confluence, characterize the bladder neck and sphincter complex, and assess the bladder and ureters. Absence of orthotopic ureteral orifices should raise suspicion for an ectopic ureter. Vaginoscopy will reveal the presence of a vaginal septum, vaginal duplication, and size of the vagina(s) for future reconstruction.\n\nIt is particularly important to establish the location of the vaginal confluence relative to the bladder neck.29 This distance represents the urethral length, and has implications for surgical repair and continence outcomes.30 Shorter uretheral length indicates a more severe malformation.29\n\nGenitography\n\nFluoroscopic genitograms are commonly used to delineate the urologic, gynecologic, and rectal structures. A Foley catheter is inserted into the perineal opening and contrast is instilled. Conventional two-dimensional fluoroscopic studies are subject to overlap of opacified structures and are thus limited in their ability to define three-dimensional relationships and obtain accurate measurements, highlighting the need for endoscopic evaluation. Many centers now employ three-dimensional computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to delineate anatomy in complex malformations (Figure 3).31,32\n\n\nFigure 3 Example of a three-dimensional cloacogram showing a long common channel with a high vaginal confluence and a short urethra.\n\nA three-dimensional cloacogram (or standard pelvic magnetic resonance imaging) is also useful for delineating Müllerian anatomy and ureteral ectopy. Urologists should be aware of a condition known as obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA), in which one hemivagina is obstructed thus vaginoscopy will demonstrate a single vagina and cervix. Suggestion of Müllerian anomalies on ultrasound that are discordant with endoscopy should be further investigated, and the internal genitalia should be directly inspected when there is opportunity such as at the time of initial diverting colostomy.16\n\nTreatment Options, Outcomes, and Complications\n\nNewborn Period\n\nIt is critical in the newborn period to ensure adequate resuscitation of the infant and decompression of the obstructed organ systems. Initial management must include a colostomy and mucous fistula in the neonatal period, typically within the first 24–48 hrs of life. This allows for decompression of the colon and separation of the fecal stream from the urinary tract.\n\nHydrocolpos Management\n\nHydrocolpos and a distended bladder with fluid and it is common in girls with cloacal malformation and develops as urine refluxes up the vagina as a result of distal urinary obstruction. The vaginal dilation can be severe enough to cause upper tract urinary obstruction and urine can reflux out the fallopian tubes causing urinary ascites. There is no consensus on management of hydrocolpos in the newborn period, but it does require drainage if there is obstructive uropathy. Traditionally drainage has been achieved with surgical decompression by means of a vaginostomy, percutaneous vaginostomy tube, or vesicostomy. More recently, the less invasive option of clean intermittent catheterization of the common channel has been utilized.33 When the common channel is catheterized, the catheter typically will preferentially enter the vagina rather than the bladder. In a comparison of the two methods of decompression, surgical and CIC, there was no difference in creatinine trend providing good evidence that CIC is a good, non-invasive, initial option for decompression of hydrocolpos.33 If a vaginal septum is present and vaginostomy may only drain one side of the vagina and inadequately decompress the system. In this case, a vaginostomy on the other side of the vagina or incision of the vaginal septum can allow for better drainage.\n\nAn important principle of all methods of hydrocolpos decompression is follow up to confirm successful drainage. After starting CIC for hydrocolpos, ultrasound should confirm decompression of the vagina and resolution of urinary tract dilation. If it is unsuccessful, a more invasive option should be considered. If hydronephrosis persists despite decompression of the vagina, workup for other causes of hydroureteronephrosis should be completed and neurogenic bladder should be suspected.\n\nBladder Management\n\nMany girls with cloacal malformation will not need any intervention for bladder emptying. If a hostile or high-pressure bladder with incomplete emptying is identified, a cutaneous vesicostomy can be created to allow for adequate decompression of the urinary tract. Clean intermittent catheterization is typically not possible because, as mentioned above, the catheter preferentially enters the vagina because the urethral takeoff is commonly anterior. Vesicostomy may also be indicated in girls with high grade vesicoureteral reflux or recurrent infections. Again, drainage and decompression of the urinary tract needs to be confirmed with ultrasound.\n\nSurgical Repair of Cloacal Malformation\n\nTiming of Repair\n\nWith the obstructed organ systems decompressed, primary surgical repair of the cloacal malformation does not need to occur immediately. This delay allows for adequate bonding period between the family and the child but also provides time to assemble the multi-disciplinary team involved in the child’s care. This period also allows for optimized nutrition and strength. There is no consensus on the optimal age of repair but repair &lt; 6 months after birth has been shown to have greater rate of post-operative complications, specifically wound dehiscence and most agree that 6–12 months of age seems to be the ideal age for primary repair.34\n\nSurgical Techniques\n\nSurgical approach is dictated by the anatomy on cloacogram and cystovaginoscopy. There are two surgical techniques used for the repair: total urogenital mobilization and urogenital separation. The principles of surgical repair are to mobilize the urethra, vagina and rectum down to the perineum so there are three separate orifices. This is done through a posterior sagittal incision and may be performed in combination with a laparotomy if needed. The posterior sagittal approach with the baby in the prone position is the initial approach. This positioning allows for improved visualization of the anatomy compared to lithotomy. First, the rectum is identified entering the common channel and mobilized superiorly to the peritoneal reflection. At this point in the operation, a total urogenital mobilization or a urogenital separation is performed.\n\nUrogenital Separation\n\nUrogenital separation was the initial technique described for repair of cloacal malformation and was the standard approach popularized by Hendren (Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10).35 It remains the approach of choice for girls with a common channel &gt; 3 cm in length. In the urogenital separation, the rectum, vagina, and urethra are separated, and individually brought to the perineum. After the rectum is mobilized off the common channel, the vagina is then carefully dissected free from the posterior wall of the urethra, bladder neck and bladder. The defect in the urethra where the vagina was mobilized away is then closed primarily over a catheter. This dissection can be challenging, and care should be taken not to devascularize or denervate the urinary tract. The vagina should be mobilized superiorly as much as possible to allow for it to reach the perineal skin without tension. If the vagina does not reach, an abdominal approach may be needed to maximize mobilization. Once the vagina reaches the skin, the vagina is brought down to the perineal skin, secured posterior to the urethra and then around laterally to create the neo-introitus. The perineal body is then recreated, and the rectum placed within the muscle complex. If the vagina still does not reach after mobilization, there are additional vaginoplasty techniques that have been described such as vaginal switch technique, a bowel interposition graft or even bringing the native vagina down on tension with the expectation that it may scar down and require introitoplasty or buccal vaginoplasty at the onset of puberty. The decision about vaginoplasty technique is a multi-disciplinary discussion between gynecology, colorectal and urologic surgery and should involve discussion pre-operatively with the family.\n\n\nFigure 4 Illustration of a urogenital separation. The patient is in the prone position, and a posterior sagittal incision has been made, exposing the posterior surfaces of the rectum, vagina, and common channel. (continued to Figure 5)\n\n\nFigure 5 The rectum has been dissected off the vaginal confluence, leaving an openin in the vagina. (continued from Figure 4, continued to Figure 6)\n\n\nFigure 6 The vagina has been dissected off the common channel at its confluence with the urethra. The opening through which the catheter is seen is the urethrovaginal fistula.

A posterior sagittal incision has been made. A catheter is in the common channel. The vagina is held with traction sutures. The confluence of the vagina and urethra is labels as urethrovaginal fistula, which will be closed after separating the vagina from the urethra. (continued to Figure 10)\n\n\nFigure 10 Intraoperative photographs of a urogenital separation. The vagina as been opened and separated from the urethra. The vagina will then be mobilized proximally to gain length to reach the perineum. The urethrovaginal fistula is again labeled and will be closed in layers primarily over a catheter. (continued from Figure 9)\n\nTotal Urogenital Mobilization\n\nA total urogenital mobilization was first introduced for cloacal repair by Peña in 1997 and was considered an “easier approach to cloaca” because it does not require separating the vagina from the urinary tract (Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13).36 Rather, this is a pull-through technique in which the urogenital sinus is mobilized until the confluence reaches the perineum, where the urethra and vagina are separated and anastomosed to the perineum. Peña proposed that this technique would reduce urethrovaginal fistula and devascularization of the urinary tract. Because the urinary tract cannot be mobilized as extensively as the vagina, there are limitations to how far the common channel can be mobilized with this technique, it is best utilized in short common channel (&lt; 3 cm) cloacal malformation. Once the rectum is mobilized off the common channel, the common channel is circumferentially dissected from the perineum and the common channel opened up until the confluence of the urethra and the vagina reaches the perineal skin without tension. The common channel is split open and used for a labioplasty. The urethra anastomosed to the anterior edge of the introitus, just posterior to the clitoral tissue. The urethra and vaginal introitus is anastomosed to the skin without tension. The perineal body is recreated and the rectum brought to the skin within the sphincter muscle complex.\n\n\nFigure 11 Intraoperative photographs of a total urogenital mobilization (TUM) cloacal repair. A posterior sagittal incision has been made, and the common channel and vaginas have been mobilized together toward the perineum. In this photograph, the rectum has already been separated.\n\n\nFigure 12 Illustration of a total urogenital mobilization (TUM) cloacal repair. The mobilization is complete once the confluence reaches the perineum and the urethra, vagina, and rectum can be separately anastomosed to the perineum. The common channel is split, and redundant tissue is rotated to line the introital opening.

The common channel is split, and redundant tissue is rotated to line the introital opening. (continued from Figure 12)\n\nDetermining Surgical Technique\n\nHistorical Perspective\n\nThe urogenital separation was the primary technique for cloacal repair and often required a posterior sagittal incision along with a laparotomy. This technique is technically demanding and time consuming. Early reports of a high-volume surgeon reported reasonable results reporting 58.8% voiding spontaneously, 28.4% who perform CIC and 2.8% who have urinary diversion.35 This study reports “urinary control” but no details about urinary accidents, emptying or renal function are reported. Peña’s description of the total urogenital mobilization introduced a simpler approach to cloacal malformation. After a large number of TUM procedures, he reported shorter operative times, hospitalization and improved urinary continence (74%) and voluntary bowel movements.37 However, he did report that in those with long common channels (&gt; 3 cm) cloaca, there was a high complexity of intra-operative decision making and often, after the common channel was completely mobilized and it would not reach, the vagina was then separated off the mobilized common channel leaving the urethra and bladder neck circumferentially mobilized with compromised vascularity and likely denervation. This puts the urethra at risk of devascularization and necrosis.\n\nThese two important experiences in the late 1990s resulted in a surgical algorithm based on measurement of the common channel. Short common channel (&lt; 3 cm) would be best served with a total urogenital mobilization, while a long common channel (&gt; 3 cm) would be recommended to have a urogenital separation with or without laparotomy or laparoscopy and bowel interposition graft if the vagina did not reach the skin. This algorithm relies greatly upon accurate measurement of the common channel. Measurement can be done endoscopically under visualization, or on 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional reconstructed cloacogram (Figure 14). However, 3-dimentional reconstructed cloacogram has been shown to be the most accurate measurement of the common channel and allows less experienced surgeons and trainees comprehend this complex anatomy at the same level as senior surgeons enhancing preparedness for the surgical procedure.38,39\n\n\nFigure 14 Sagittal T2 MRI images of the cloacal malformation delineating the urethra and the common channel lengths.\n\nDevelopment of Current Surgical Algorithm\n\nFor nearly 2 decades, surgical decision making based solely on common channel length was the standard of care. However, as multi-disciplinary care became more prevalent and urologists were more closely involved in the care of these patients along with pediatric surgery, it was observed that while most girls with short common channels had longer urethras, there is an unusual subtype of girls with short common channels who have very short urethras. In this subset of patients, if a TUM were to be performed, it would result in a very short urethra and the bladder neck being positioned right at the perineum and very poor continence potential. As a result of this observation an updated algorithm was developed incorporating both common channel length and urethral length in determining the surgical approach Figure 15.13 In this algorithm if a common channel is &gt; 3 cm, regardless of urethral length, a UG separation is performed. If a common channel is &lt; 3 cm and the urethra is &gt; 1.5 cm, then a TUM is the operative approach of choice. The unusual variant that has a common channel &lt; 3 cm and a urethra &lt; 1.5 cm, this new algorithm would dictate that the child should have a UG separation, thereby maintaining the anatomic position of the bladder and bladder neck within the pelvis and avoiding mobilizing it down and under the pelvic diaphragm. This surgical algorithm was the first time in over 20 years since Peña’s description of the TUM that a new surgical technique had been proposed and it has been well accepted across high volume centers. Results of this algorithm have been excellent with regards to reduced complexity of decision making and change of plan intra-operatively. With accurate pre-operative assessment of urethral and common channel measurements, significant urologic comorbidity can be avoided and results in a patent and catheterizable urethra in 97% of patients.40\n\n\nFigure 15 Suggested surgical algorithm for cloacal malformation.13\n\nPost Operative Management\n\nWound management and catheter drainage is paramount after posterior sagittal cloacal repair. There is no consensus about the length of time for urethral catheterization after cloacal repair but this typically ranges from 1–2 weeks in TUM and up to 4 weeks in UG separation. Some advocate for vesicostomy drainage of the bladder but this is not required. The posterior sagittal and introital incisions are at risk of dehiscence so avoiding any straddling or splits is critical during healing. It is also advised that perineal pressure is avoided, and children not be held by their perineum or be sitting in jumpers or straddle toys. Postoperative anatomy is commonly evaluated with a thorough clinic exam or cystoscopy and exam under anesthesia in the operating room.\n\nBladder Management Post-Operatively\n\nAfter surgical repair of the cloacal malformation, it is important to ensure adequate bladder emptying. Surgical mobilization and underlying bladder dysfunction can lead to urinary retention or incomplete emptying. This can be managed by having all children perform intermittent catheterization after catheter removal and adjust schedule of catheterization based on urine volumes. Others use pre-operative urodynamic assessment to aid in decision making about CIC. There is no consensus about post-operative bladder management with catheterization. In a recent report of 18 girls who underwent cloacal repair, 44.4% required assisted bladder emptying (CIC or vesicostomy) while the remainder were diapered.41 Factors associated with need for CIC after repair were long common channel length, UG separation and need for assisted bladder emptying prior to surgical repair. Importantly, diaper management pre-operatively did not guarantee that assisted bladder emptying could be avoided post-operatively.\n\nVaginal Management Post-Operatively\n\nPost-operative patency of the vaginal introitus is commonly assessed with a thorough office exam or exam under anesthesia. If the vaginal introitus becomes stenotic early in childhood, this can be observed until she is older and begins puberty. If the stenosis is severe enough to prevent outflow of menses, this should be managed prior to menarche. Ultrasound surveillance of the reproductive tract is recommended beginning 6–9 months after breast bud development and continuing every 6–9 months through menarche, assessing endometrial thickness in each uterine body.15 If obstructed menstrual flow is detected, gynecology or endocrinology should be consulted to initiate hormonal suppression to temporize until surgical intervention. Preferred operative techniques for introital or vaginal stenosis include simple introitoplasty or buccal mucosal vaginoplasty.42 Many centers have pediatric and adolescent gynecology specialists who monitor for this, though urologists may assume this care where pediatric gynecologists are unavailable.\n\nLong-Term Outcomes\n\nBladder Function\n\nUrinary continence is challenging to assess due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the population. Hendren reported ~60% spontaneous voiding with “urinary control” and Peña similarly reported 54% continence and 46% requiring clean intermittent catheterization. However, neither of these studies report definitions of continence or report rates of bladder reconstruction.35,36 More recently, there was a review of long-term outcomes for 50 patients older than 3 years with repaired cloacal malformation. This group reports 80% of girls achieving “social continence”, of whom 22% void spontaneously while the remainder perform CIC.43 This same group had 46% who required a mean number of 4.7 surgical procedures to achieve continence. Again, definition of continence is not well defined and many who are “socially continent” had reconstructive surgery. There is a great need for long-term follow up in this population to determine factors associated with achieving continence and reliable continence rates.\n\nRenal Function\n\nRenal insufficiency is a constant concern in girls with cloacal malformation. The largest series of 64 patients reports greater than 50% have GFR &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 with 17% having end stage renal disease, 6% requiring transplant and 6% deceased from renal failure.44 This same group stresses that, renal impairment appears to be acquired over time as 66% of girls who progressed to chronic renal insufficiency had normal serum nadir creatinine. Other smaller series report far more favorable results ranging from 66–100% of girls with normal renal function at 5–9 year follow up.45,46,47 Interestingly, these series are more recent and are all institutions with multi-disciplinary teams caring for these girls. Again, long-term follow up from high volume centers evaluating renal function in these patients is greatly needed.\n\nKey Points\n\n  Cloacal malformation represents the most severe female anorectal malformation\n  Urologic and systemic comorbidities are common including upper tract anomalies, and Müllerian anomalies, and bladder dysfunction. Comprehensive urologic evaluation multidisciplinary care is paramount.\n  Initial management prioritizes early drainage of hydrocolpos and diverting colostomy\n  Surgery to repair cloacal malformation is calls a posterior sagittal anorectovaginorectoplasty (PSARVUP). There are two primary surgical approaches: total urogenital mobilization (for less severe malformations) and urogenital separation (for more severe anomalies)\n  Many girls with require bladder catheterization. Long term data on continence outcomes and renal function is lacking\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n  Levitt MA, Peña A. Pitfalls in the management of newborn cloacas. Pediatr Surg Int 2005; 21: 264–269.

        "content": "Introduction and Terminology\n\nDisorders/differences of sex development (DSD, also referred to as intersex) are congenital conditions in which chromosomal, gonadal or phenotypic sex are different from what is seen as typically male or female. A new, broad DSD classification was introduced in 2006 via the “Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders.”1 This newer classification incorporates a wide range of conditions, including congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), ovotesticular DSD, androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). The 2006 consensus definition is more expansive than what were previously referred to as intersex conditions, also including anatomic anomalies such as cloacal and bladder exstrophy and vaginal agenesis, and chromosomal abnormalities that do not cause atypical genitalia (e.g., Klinefelter Syndrome [47, XXY]). Table 1 provides an overview of previous nomenclature, and recommended terminology updates proposed in the 2006 consensus statement. Give the wide range of conditions under the DSD ‘umbrella’, an individualized, multidisciplinary approach to care is paramount.\n\nTable 1 Revised DSD Nomenclature. Source: Lee PA, Houk CP, Ahmed SF.

Among individuals affected by DSD conditions, variability of terminology preferences exist, and there is a lack of consensus about exactly which conditions should be considered a DSD.2,3,4 In particular, some members of the CAH community identify as having an endocrine disorder, not a DSD/intersex condition.5 It is also unclear which individuals with proximal hypospadias should be considered to have “a DSD”.6 Clinicians who care for DSD conditions should be aware of the nomenclature evolution and controversies, and use the terms that their patients prefer during individual medical encounters. For the purposes of this chapter, the current, medically accepted terminology will be utilized.\n\nEmbryology\n\nTypical Development of Internal/External Genitalia\n\nAll developing fetuses begin the same. Anatomical resources for either male or female development and variations are present in the early weeks of gestation (Table 2) gonadal ridge, Wolffian (mesonephric) and Müllerian (paramesonephric) ducts, cloaca and subsequent urogenital sinus, genital tubercle and labioscrotal swellings. Figure 1 shows genes responsible for development of the undifferentiated gonad to either a testis or an ovary.\n\nTable 2 Embryologic Precursors and Typical Male/Female Structures.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Embryologic Structure\n      Female-Typical Structure\n      Male-Typical Structure\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Gonadal Ridge\n      Ovary\n      Testicle\n    \n    \n      Wolffian (mesonephric) duct\n      Paroophoron, epoophoron, Gartner’s duct cyst\n      Vas defrens, epididymis, seminal vesicles\n    \n    \n      Müllerian (paramesonephric) duct\n      Fallopian tubes, uterus, proximal vagina\n      Appendix testis, prostatic utricle\n    \n    \n      Cloaca and subsequent urogenital sinus\n      Bladder, distal vagina, urethra\n      Bladder, prostate, urethra\n    \n    \n      Genital tubercle\n      Clitoris\n      Penis\n    \n    \n      Labioscrotal swellings\n      Labial complex\n      Scrotum\n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 1 Development of undifferentiated gonads. All gonads begin the same. Primordial germ cells migrate to the gonadal ridge prior to 6 weeks and the infrastructure to support gonad development is further influenced by various genes. SF-1 and WT-1 have influence over gonadal development and subsequent endocrine communication to the Wolffian (mesonephric-blue) and Müllerian (paramesonephric-orange) ducts. Note the relationship between the mesonephros (pink), mesonephric duct and undifferentiated gonad (tan). WNT4 is the ovary determining gene. DAX-1 is considered the “anti-testis gene.” Duplication of DAX-1 results in XY sex reversal. SRY on the Y chromosome is the testis determining gene. SOX-9 supports Sertoli development but also has homology to participate in testis development in absence of SRY.\n\nTypical male development (Figure 2) is initiated very early in gestation by the Y chromosome, specifically SRY, determining testicular development. WT-1, SF-1 are involved in development of testis and ovary, and SOX-9 is involved in Sertoli cell differentiation. The Leydig cells of the testis subsequently begin testosterone production at approximately 8 weeks gestation and the Sertoli cells produce anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), inhibiting maturation of the Müllerian ducts into uterus, Fallopian tubes and upper vagina. Testosterone dictates early growth of the genital tubercle and development of the Wolffian duct into vas deferens, epididymis and seminal vesicle. Development or lack thereof in the Wolffian and Müllerian systems occurs as a paracrine rather than systemic action, explaining asymmetric development of ductal structures when the gonad composition is asymmetric. Conversion of testosterone to the more potent dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5α-reductase-2 occurs in various tissues and is responsible for further maturation of the penis, tubularization of the urogenital sinus and urethral plate, and closure of the scrotum by 14 weeks gestation. Subsequent growth of the phallic structure occurs because of waning fetal androgen and somatic growth.\n\n\nFigure 2 Typical early development of male external and internal genital tract, as influenced by fetal testis. Testosterone and AMH production by the fetal testis result in early masculinization of the genital tubercle and regression of Müllerian ducts. Subsequent development of the external genitalia and urethra is influenced by conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. (not depicted here, see Figure 4).\n\nTypical female development (Figure 3) is often viewed as occurring by default since it is not overseen by hormones produced by the testes. Ovarian determination does not figure prominently in embryologic development of the genitalia. Low levels of androgen and AMH allow female typical development of the genital tubercle as clitoris, labioscrotal folds as labial complex, and distal urogenital sinus as urethra and vagina. The paired Müllerian bodies migrate and fuse to form the uterus. Together they stimulate the sinovaginal bulb on the urogenital sinus to begin development of the lower vagina.\n\n\nFigure 3 Typical early development of female external and internal genital tract, as influenced by fetal ovary. Low level AMH and androgen by the ovary results in development of typical female anatomy: uterus and fallopian tubes, upper vagina. Fetal estrogen production has less impact on female line development than environment with minimal androgen and AMH levels. The labia will be affected by maternal estrogens. Note also the ultimate “water under the bridge” relationship of ureter (branched off mesonephric duct) and fallopian tube. Note mesonephric duct remnants associated with fallopian tube.\n\nDifferent Pathways that Can Cause DSD\n\nDevelopmental differences can occur through atypical:\n\n\n  Genetic determination of the gonads (e.g., mixed gonadal dysgenesis, ovotesticular DSD)\n  Hormone production (e.g., 5α-reductase deficiency, 3-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, 21-hydroxylase deficiency CAH, or Luteinizing Hormone [LH] receptor mutations)\n  Hormone action (e.g., complete or partial AIS)\n  Variations in precursor tissue development/separation of the cloaca (e.g., Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser [MRKH] syndrome, cloacal exstrophy, cloacal anomalies)\n\n\nEven with a 46,XX or 46,XY karyotype, there is no certainty that development will be along the typical female or male line. In 46,XY alone, numerous differences occur due to Y chromosome mutations that alter testis determination or function, somatic mutations that lead to dysgenesis of the developing testicle, variations in testosterone biosynthesis or conversion, and X-linked mutations that impact androgen receptor function. External phenotype, internal development, potential for spontaneous puberty or fertility, and identification along the gender spectrum can all be affected. In considering the features of the various DSD conditions described below, is important to note that hormone production and action occur on a spectrum. Therefore, deficiencies in receptor function or hormone and converting enzyme production are not necessarily complete deficits. Phenotype can vary widely, even among individuals with the same diagnosis.\n\nPathophysiology\n\nVariations in development of the internal and external genitalia are directed by sex chromosome and somatic mutations, resultant gonadal function, and tissue response. When receptor function or presence of a pertinent enzyme is atypical due to a known or yet to be identified genetic mutation, the effect on the target organs can be complete (no evident function) or partial. The phenotype varies accordingly. As one example, various phenotypes of androgen insensitivity (complete CAIS, partial PAIS and mild MAIS: spectrum of genital phenotype from typical female—ambiguous—typical male) occur via numerous distinct mutations of the Androgen Receptor gene on the X Chromosome (X-linked recessive condition). Table 3 shows a DSD classification system, divided by karyotype.\n\nTable 3 An Example of a DSD Classification\n\n\n  \n    \n      Sex Chromosome DSD\n      46,XY DSD\n      46,XX DSD\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      45,X (Turner syndrome and variants)\n      Disorders of gonadal (testicular) development: (1) complete gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome); (2) partial gonadal dysgenesis; (3) gonadal regression; and (4) ovotesticular DSD\n      Disorders of gonadal (ovarian) development: (1) ovotesticular DSD; (2) testicular DSD (eg, SRY+, duplicate SOX9); and (3) gonadal dysgenesis\n    \n    \n      47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome and variants)\n      Disorders in androgen synthesis or action:(1) androgen biosynthesis defect (e.g., 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, 5RD2 deficiency, StAR mutations); (2) defect in androgen action (e.g., CAIS, PAIS); (3) luteinizing hormone receptor defects (e.g., Leydig cell hypoplasia, aplasia);  and (4)disorders of anti-Müllerian hormone and anti-Müllerian hormone receptor (persistent Müllerian duct syndrome)\n      Androgen excess:(1) fetal (eg, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-hydroxylase deficiency); (2) fetoplacental (aromatase deficiency, POR [P450 Oxidoreductase]); and (3) maternal (luteoma, exogenous, etc)\n    \n    \n      45,X/46,XY (MGD, ovotesticular DSD)\n       \n      Other (eg, cloacal exstrophy, vaginal atresia, MURCS [Müllerian, renal, cervicothoracic somite abnormalities], other syndromes)\n    \n    \n      46,XX/46,XY (chimeric, ovotesticular DSD)\n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\n46,XX DSD\n\nThe most common form of 46,XX DSD is CAH, in which adrenal enzymatic function is impaired. Figure 4 shows the typical adrenal steroid cascade, which begins with cholesterol. End products are aldosterone, cortisol, and sex steroids. The sex steroid arm of the cascade ends with androstenedione which is converted to a small amount of testosterone. Production of testosterone in the Leydig cells of the testis likewise begins with cholesterol. In CAH, reduced enzyme function causes reduced mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) and glucocorticoids (cortisol), and shunting toward sex steroid production. The result is masculinization of a fetus with 46,XX karyotype. Although a complete absence of enzymatic function and downstream adrenal steroid products is easiest to remember, the function may be only partially impaired and feedback in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis affected accordingly.\n\n\nFigure 4 Steroid cascade and spectrum of CAH diagnoses. Any degree of defect in production of an enzyme results in decreased downstream product and shunting of the cascade toward the sex steroids. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is stimulated to compensate. Increased ACTH results in adrenal cortex hyperplasia and further increased production of precursors.\n\nTypical anatomy of a patient with 46,XX CAH includes varying degrees of clitoral enlargement and urogenital sinus formation. Gonads are ovaries and are not palpable. There are several mutations that lead to different characteristic textbook adrenal steroid milieus and physical and physiological phenotypes. The most common form is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Infants with 46,XX CAH can experience life-threatening salt wasting at about 1 week of life, so this diagnosis must considered for all infants with ambiguous genitalia. An elevated 17-OH-progesterone is diagnostic. Female gender identity and sex of rearing is most frequent, though not universal.\n\n46,XY DSD\n\nWithin the category of 46,XY DSD, a range of disorders of gonadal development and androgen synthesis and action exist, as detailed in Table 3. Along with the spectrum of AIS conditions detailed above, complete or partial gonadal dysgenesis can result in similar anatomic variations: an infant with 46,XY chromosomes and either typical female or ambiguous phenotype (e.g., proximal hypospadias with penoscrotal transposition, and one or both gonads undescended). Individuals with complete AIS and complete gonadal dysgenesis are typically raised female, and identify as female; those with partial forms of either condition have more variability in sex of rearing and gender identity.\n\nAnother 46,XY DSD, 5α-reductase deficiency, causes reduced conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), resulting in variable genital phenotype. Figure 5 and Figure 6 compare the typical testicular development pathway to the pathway that occurs in patients with 5α-reductase deficiency.\n\n\nFigure 5 Typical 46XY prenatal genital development Development can deviate from “typical” at several different steps. Striped arrows signify paracrine type function. Dashed lines indicate regression of Müllerian ducts early in development.\n\n\nFigure 6 46XY prenatal genital development in patients with vs 5-α-reductase deficiency. Testes are determined and have normal testosterone and AMH production. There is no uterus. Due to impaired 5-α-reductase function, the ratio of T /DHT is notably increased. In the setting of lower DHT, there is variability in phenotype from typical female to typical male to ambiguous genital anatomy. With severe deficiency, phallus and urogenital sinus development are arrested at early stage of masculinization, with a single urogenital orifice in the perineal region and no fusion of the labioscrotal folds.\n\nFigure 7 shows the resultant adrenal cascade in the rare example of a patient with 46,XY CAH who presents clinically with ambiguous genitalia: 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [HSD] deficiency. The enzyme blockage occurs before conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to androstenedione in the adrenal steroid cascade, so infants experience reduced mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids along with a difference in genital development. Like babies with 46,XX CAH and 21-hydroxylase or 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, infants with 3-β-HSD deficiency can experience life threatening salt wasting. Diagnosis is made through elevated 17-OH pregnenolone and DHEA.\n\n\nFigure 7 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency steroid pathway. This relatively proximal defect in the adrenal cholesterol cascade results in severe corticosteroid and mineralocorticoid deficiency. It is unique, in that 46,XY babies with CAH have under-masculinized genital appearance while 46,XX babies have genital appearance of typical (or nearly typical) female. When a newborn with prenatally detected Y chromosome is born with ambiguous appearance of the genitalia, this is the one CAH diagnosis to rule out. Elevated 17-OH-pregnenolone and DHEA help make the diagnosis.\n\nSex Chromosome DSD\n\nOf the sex chromosome DSD diagnoses listed in Table 3, the conditions with a 45,X/46,XY (or similar) mosaic karyotype warrant particular mention. Patients with this karyotype can have female-typical external genitalia (Tuner Syndrome with Y chromosome material [TS+Y]), ambiguous genitalia (mixed gonadal dysgenesis [MGD]), or male-typical external genitalia. Patients with TS+Y have increased risk of gonadal tumors, differing from patients with 45,X Turner syndrome. Phenotype and sex of rearing/gender identity is variable in MGD, though result is frequently gonadal and labioscrotal asymmetry, as detailed in Figure 8. Any patient with 45,X/46,XY karyotype can have manifestations of TS (e.g., aortic coarctation, renal anomalies), so should undergo the same systemic screening tests as classic TS patients.7,8\n\n\nFigure 8 45,X/46,XY Mixed gonadal dysgenesis. Multiple phenotypes occur with this mosaic karyotype. This diagram represents internal and external development in the setting of one testis (determined by Y chromosome) and one streak gonad (default development, ovarian-type stroma). The classic phenotype, when a degree of ambiguity is observed, is one nonpalpable gonad, one descended testis, and proximal hypospadias. As T and AMH have paracrine function, the streak gonad is associated with hemiuterus and fallopian tube with no Wolffian structures. Due to Y material, there is risk of gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma. The testis has variable dysgenetic development impacting early and future function and tumor risk. Primary masculinization occurs but further development of the urethra and scrotum is variably impacted by testis function.\n\nOvotesticular DSD\n\nOvotesticular DSD occurs when there is both ovarian and testicular tissue present in the same individual (former name – true hermaphroditism). Typically, the ovarian tissue is more well developed, and the testicular tissue is dysgenetic. Phenotype, sex of rearing/gender identity, and fertility potential are all variable. Importantly, patients with ovotesticular DSD can have any karyotype (though 46, XX is most common), so this diagnosis must be considered for any patient who presents with ambiguous genitalia.\n\nMultidisciplinary Evaluation\n\nBeyond proposing less pejorative nomenclature, other cornerstones of the 2006 consensus statement are paradigm are counseling by a multidisciplinary team and longitudinal psychosocial support of patients and parents.1\n\nThe Multidisciplinary Team\n\nThe team who works with a family as a newborn inpatient consultation is preferably the same who will work with patients and families longitudinally. The team is responsible for educating the family on the condition and all potential management options; it provides support and engages the family in shared decision making where decisions are required (e.g., sex of rearing, disclosure, surgery). The team ideally includes the following members:\n\n\n  Endocrinology\n  Mental Health (Psychologist, Social Worker)\n  Urology / Pediatric Surgery / Gynecology\n  Genetic Counselor / Geneticist\n  Nursing\n  Patient advocate / Patient educator\n  Neonatologist (inpatient consultation)\n\n\nEach specialist brings different perspectives, relevant clinical expertise, and interpersonal skills to the multidisciplinary team. Surgeons are an important part of the team despite early or urgent surgical needs being uncommon. All are exposed to team discussions and contribute to the patient and family experience. Ideally, mutual respect and willingness to consider all perspectives enhances team functioning and allows the team to provide even higher-level care over time, particularly as standards of care evolve.\n\nEach individual living with a DSD condition may not have access to a functional multidisciplinary team. Some may not embrace work with the team or may find longitudinal follow-up burdensome. Each early opportunity for education about the diagnosis and potential long-term concerns or medical needs is therefore very important. In situations where long-term follow-up is feasible and acceptable, this can be accomplished in the context of more regular single specialty care, as appropriate for the patient. For example, some of the patients with CAH at the authors’ institution follow with their endocrinologist quarterly and participate a full multidisciplinary team visit yearly.\n\nActively working together, learning from each other and from patients/families, facilitates team functioning and advances care. The team draws upon prior experiences and assimilates new knowledge, particularly in the realms of patient experience and next generation genetic testing. The team also identifies gaps in knowledge and within the care paradigm that can be addressed through collaborations and intentional research. Periodic case- or topic-based multidisciplinary conference helps build fluency in the various conditions for team members and learners and allows opportunity to understand differences in philosophy.\n\nInitial Approach to the Patient with a Suspected DSD\n\nPatients with suspected DSD classically present in infancy with ambiguous genitalia, or in adolescence with primary amenorrhea. DSD conditions can also come to medical attention due to incidental imaging or intraoperative findings, an inguinal hernia in a girl, or if girl experiences masculinization at the time of puberty Increasingly, DSD conditions are suspected prenatally due to cell free DNA-ultrasound discordance, or concern for a difference in genital development seen on ultrasound.\n\nWhen an infant with a suspected DSD is born, consultation with a multidisciplinary team (described above) is recommended whenever feasible. Remember to congratulate the family on their new baby (a step that is often overlooked, especially when there is surprise about, or of lack of familiarity with, DSD). Utilize gender-neutral terms, (“your baby”, not “it”) when referring to the infant if there is any question about sex assignment. Figure 9 shows recommendations for describing the newborn genital exam, including gender neutral terms to use. Along with a detailed prenatal history, family history, and physical exam, recommendations for initial evaluation of a patient with suspected DSD include:\n\n\n  Karyotype\n  Endocrine testing (17-OH-progesterone, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, electrolytes)\n  Pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for gonadal position and type, and for presence of Mϋllerian structures\n\n\n\nFigure 9 Describing the newborn exam with gender-neutral anatomical terms. When examining a newborn with an ambiguous appearance of the genitals, gender-neutral terminology should be utilized until sufficient data permits shared decision-making with the parents for determination of sex of rearing. The exam should document the following reflections of androgen exposure: 1) Length of clitorophallic structure, 2) Width of glans, 3) Number and position of perineal orifices, 4) Degree of fusion of labioscrotal folds, 5) Hyper-pigmentation and rugation of labioscrotal folds, 6) Anogenital distance, 7) Location of any palpable gonads\n\nAn algorithmic approach based on the number of palpable gonads and results of endocrine, genetic, and imaging as above can efficiently help to narrow the differential diagnosis. Most medically critical in the newborn is to rule out life-threatening salt-wasting CAH. The entire multidisciplinary team described above plays a role during this critical diagnostic period to help the family integrate new pieces of information, and to make decisions about sex of rearing, disclosure, and surgery.\n\nSurgical Management Options\n\nSurgical options for patients with DSD are highly individualized, and decisions about surgical treatment should ideally be made in the context of a multidisciplinary team. Depending on the patient’s needs and goals, procedures can be diagnostic, reconstructive, or extirpative.\n\nDiagnostic Procedures\n\nDiagnostic procedures are often pursed when the anatomy or diagnosis remain unclear after endocrine and genetic evaluation, and detailed radiologic imaging.\n\nEndoscopy provides for detailed visualization and measurements of the urogenital tract. For example, the length and configuration of a urogenital sinus can be characterized. Vaginal structures can be evaluated for depth, number, and presence or absence of a cervix.\n\nDiagnostic laparoscopy assists with visualization of gonads and Müllerian structures. This visualization can aid in diagnosis, and provide information for future reconstructive surgical planning. Gonadal biopsy can be performed via laparoscopic or open approach to determine tissue type (for example, if ovotesticular DSD is suspected), or sent for karyotype if Y chromosome material is suspected but has not been identified on peripheral blood karyotyping. Figure 10 shows laparoscopic still images from a patient with MGD: the MGD diagnosis was suspected clinically, and confirmed with the gross and histological gonadal appearance provided by diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsy.\n\n\nFigure 10 Diagnostic laparoscopic images of the pelvis in a 1-year-old patient with mixed gonadal dysgenesis. A. *Left streak gonad. B. *Right dysgenetic testis. **Uterus.\n\nMasculinizing Genitoplasty\n\nFor patients with DSD, masculinizing genitoplasty most frequently involves a proximal hypospadias repair, often with scrotoplasty to correct penoscrotal transposition and/or a bifid configuration. The technical details of hypospadias repair are similar to patients without a defined DSD condition. Hypospadias repair in patients with DSD typically requires a two-stage procedure to achieve correction of chordee and a terminal urethral meatus. There is controversy in the literature about whether patients with a known DSD diagnosis have poorer hypospadias surgical outcomes as compared to patients with proximal hypospadias who do not have a specific DSD.9,10,11\n\nFeminizing Genitoplasty\n\nComponents include clitoroplasty (with labioplasty), and vaginoplasty. A variety of approaches exist, which can be tailored based on patient anatomy and goals. Example preoperative surgical markings for a patient with CAH who underwent a partial urogenital mobilization (PUM) and labioplasty without clitoroplasty is illustrated in Figure 11.\n\nClitoroplasty and Labiaplasty\n\nThe most frequently reported modern clitoroplasty procedures involve a nerve sparing clitoral reduction.12 The clitoris is degloved and corporal (erectile) tissue removed, avoiding the dorsal neurovascular bundles. The tunica albuginea sparing approach to reduction clitoroplasty was introduced further preserve glandular blood supply and sensation, and involves ventral corporal incisions, and excision of erectile tissue, while preserving the surrounding tunica. The glans of the clitoris is frequently preserved, recessed proximally, and secured beneath the pubis. Glans reduction can be performed by excising a ventral wedge of tissue and reapproximating the ventral edges to one another. However, this approach carries a risk of reduced glandular sensation. A concealed clitoris can often be achieved with clitoroplasty along with labioplasty such that glans reduction is becoming less frequent.\n\nSeveral corporal sparing techniques have emerged as alternatives to the clitoral reduction procedure described above. As one example, Pippi Salle described a corporal disassembly procedure.13 For this procedure, the corporal bodies are completely separated from the glans and neurovascular bundle, and from one another. The corporal bodies are then individually tunneled into their respective ipsilateral labia majora, and the glans repositioned proximally, similar to the clitoral reduction procedures. This ‘Pippi Salle procedure’ has the theoretical advantage of reversibility, as no tissue is removed, though attempts at reversal, and other long-term outcomes, have not yet been reported.\n\nLabioplasty is typically the final step of a clitoroplasty (with or without vaginoplasty) procedure. The goals are to reconfigure the clitoral hood and shaft tissue over the clitoris to conceal the glans, and to advance the skin edges posteriorly, lateral to the vestibule/vaginal opening.\n\nVaginoplasty\n\nThe approach to vaginoplasty involves an assessment of whether the patient has a urogenital sinus with a low confluence (short common channel with separation of vagina and urethra close to perineum) or high confluence (longer common channel and higher separation.14\n\nA perineal skin flap vaginoplasty (Fortunoff technique) can be sufficient for patients with a low confluence urogenital sinus. For this technique, a posterior U-shaped flap is created (as in Figure 11) The posterior wall of the vagina is then incised proximal to the dysplastic confluence, and the flap positioned and secured within this vaginal incision to increase the vaginal caliber.\n\n\nFigure 11 Preoperative surgical marking for a patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who is to undergo a partial urogenital mobilization and labioplasty without clitoroplasty. A catheter is noted within the urogenital sinus opening. The midline marking (dashed red) extends through the fused labioscrotal folds, and the omega shaped mark (solid blue) will form the posterior skin flap for vaginoplasty.\n\nIn total urogenital mobilization (TUM) or partial urogenital mobilization (PUM), the urethra and vagina are be mobilized toward the perineum as a unit.15 The distinction between the two is whether anterior dissection behind the pubis takes the pubourethral ligament, as shown in Figure 12. There is the potential concern for urinary incontinence with more extensive mobilization but that has not been definitively demonstrated, and is likely more of a concern if the distance from confluence to bladder neck is foreshortened. If applied to low confluence cases, PUM generally brings vagina to a range where it can be exteriorized or bridged with a posterior based perineal flap (see above). High confluence signifies a more complex anatomy including a longer distance to reach the perineum, a closer relationship between vagina and bladder neck, and often a shorter vagina. Direct pull-through may not be advantageous in the long run. In the high confluence cases, even with urogenital mobilization, the vagina will need to be separated from the urogenital sinus and pulled through to the perineum. In this scenario, the urogenital sinus becomes the urethra. The vagina reaches the perineum with the assistance of perineal skin flaps or use of excess mobilized urogenital sinus tissue as a flap.\n\n\nFigure 12 Sagittal cross-sectional images of partial vs total urogenital mobilization. A. Partial urogenital mobilization: urethra and vagina are advanced towards the perineum as a unit. Pubourethral ligament (blue dashed line box) is left intact. B. Total urogenital mobilization: urethra and vagina are advanced towards the perineum as a unit. Pubourethral ligament (blue dashed line box) is divided. Adapted From: Rink RC, Cain MP. Urogenital mobilization for urogenital sinus repair. BJU Int 2008; 102 (9): 1182–1197. DOI: 10.1111/j.1464-410x.2008.08091.x. (permission granted 2/1/2022)\n\nFor patients who are born with absent or poorly developed Müllerian structures, vaginoplasty involves blunt creation of a neovagina in the retrovesical space between the bladder and rectum, and then lining the new potential space with either autologous tissue (e.g., skin graft, buccal mucosa graft, peritoneal flap) or other biologic grafts (e.g., small intestinal submucosa [SIS]). These techniques can also be used as an adjunct to the procedures described above, or in the reoperative setting.\n\nVaginal Dilations\n\nSome patients with DSD (e.g., complete AIS) can achieve a vagina that will permit comfortable, pleasurable sexual activity with regular vaginal dilations, without needing a surgical vaginoplasty. All patients who undergo a surgical vaginoplasty also require vaginal dilations while healing from surgery, and until they are having vaginal intercourse on a consistent basis.\n\nGonadectomy and Gonadal Management\n\nThe paradigm for gonadal management in patients with DSD has evolved over time. Traditionally, patients with DSD conditions where there is an increased risk for tumor formation were counseled to undergo gonadectomy. Infertility was assumed. Over time, it has become evident that there is a wide range of tumor risk, and that the tumors that form are frequently gonadoblastoma (not malignant).16,17 Dysgerminomas (malignant germ cell tumors) are possible, but exceedingly rare before puberty. There also may be non-traditional fertility potential for some who were previously considered to be infertile.18 Thus, gonadal management recommendations are becoming more individualized, considering patient diagnosis (and thus predicted tumor risk), age, and potential for endogenous gonadal function (both hormonal and reproductive). For patients who elect for gonadectomy, gonadal tissue cryopreservation is an emerging option that may allow for biology fertility, assuming expected future advances in assisted reproductive technologies occur.19 No evidence-based surveillance protocols are yet available for patients who elect to retain their gonads; the authors’ institution typically recommends pelvic ultrasound every 6–12 months. (Table 4) shows gonadal recommendation strategies for several DSD diagnoses.\n\nTable 4 Gonadal Management Options by Diagnosis. * consider experimental gonadal tissue cryopreservation.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Diagnosis\n      Estimated Tumor Risk\n      Germ Cells Expected?\n      Puberty Expected?\n      Gonad Management Options\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      46, XY Complete Gonadal Dysgenesis (Swyer Syndrome)\n      High – Up to 35%\n      No (maybe precursor germ cells)\n      No\n      -Gonadectomy*\n    \n    \n      Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome\n      High –Up to 50% depending on gonad location\n      Yes Sperm possible\n      Yes, variable\n      -Orchidopexy, consider biopsy-Observation w/ ultrasounds-Gonadectomy*\n    \n    \n      Turner Syndrome + Y Chromosome\n      Medium – ~10-30%\n      Maybe – Eggs possible\n      Possible\n      -Observation w/ultrasounds-Gonadectomy* (standard, low level of evidence)\n    \n    \n      Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome\n      Low –~2-10%\n      Yes – Sperm precursors\n      Yes – due to aromatization of testosterone to estrogen\n      -Postpubertal gonadectomy*-Observation w/ultrasounds, MRI\n    \n  \n\n\nManagement of Mϋllerian Structures\n\nFor patients who are being raised male and have persistent Mϋllerian structures (i.e., a large utricle), are typically left in place unless they become symptomatic. Excision risks potential damage to vasal structures (and possibly or pelvic nerves), and patients are frequently asymptomatic. Hypospadias repair is safe, and excision of even large utricular structures is not mandatory before hypospadias repair. If symptoms such as infections or bothersome cyclic hematuria occur, then surgical excision can be pursued through an open, laparoscopic or robotic approach. Hormonal management with menstrual suppression can also be considered for patients who experience cyclic pain to due to an obstructed Mϋllerian remnant, or bothersome cyclic hematuria.\n\nConclusions\n\nDSDs encompass a wide range of conditions that result from abnormal chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic development. A wide range of phenotype exists, even within specific DSD diagnoses and categories. A multidisciplinary approach to evaluation and long-term follow up is recommended, whenever possible.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Medically accepted DSD terminology is not preferred by all affected individuals and their families. In individual clinical encounters, ask patients and families which terms they prefer to use when referring to diagnosis and anatomy.\n  DSD conditions occur due to atypical chromosomes, gonads, or hormone action. Thinking through the level of abnormality, and determining whether the defect identified is complete or partial, can help predict patient phenotype.\n  The number of palpable gonads sets the foundation for a DSD differential diagnosis. The differential is further refined through karyotype, endocrine labs, and pelvic ultrasound.\n  Remember to congratulate new parents who have an infant with a suspected DSD—this critical step is often forgotten.\n  CAH is the most common form of 46, XX DSD. Clinical features include masculinized external genitalia with non-palpable gonads. Life threatening salt wasting can occur at 1 week of life.\n  Ovotesticular DSD can occur in a patient with any karyotype.\n  A patient with a 45, X/46, XY karyotype can have female-typical, ambiguous, or male-typical external genitalia. Any patient with this karyotype can have systemic manifestations of Turner Syndrome.\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Lee PA, Houk CP, Ahmed SF. Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders.

        "title": "Social and Medicolegal Issues with DSD",
        "content": "Australasian Perspective\n\nBy Kiarash Taghavi, Nathalie Webb, Chloe A. Hanna, &amp; Jacqueline K. Hewitt\n\nIntroduction: The Child’s Wellbeing is at the Centre of Care and Ethical Concern\n\nMaking shared-decisions about the well-being of infants, children and adolescents with differences or disorders of sex development (DSD) involves the integration of a complex range of medical, psychosocial, ethical, human rights, and legal considerations.1 The established pillars of multi-disciplinary care of children with DSD within our clinical network include,2,3\n\n\n  minimising physical risk to the child;\n  minimising psychosocial risk to the child;\n  preserving the potential for fertility;\n  preserving or promoting the capacity to have satisfying sexual relations;\n  leaving options open for the future,\n  respecting the parents’ wishes and beliefs.\n\n\nThe balance and translation of these principles are individualised to the specific context of each child, family, diagnosis and sociocultural environment.4 It is recognised within this shared decision-making that considerations of “doing something” and “doing nothing” are both active decisions that will have consequences. While the cognitive predisposition may assume that “doing nothing” is more benign, less likely to cause harm and should be the natural default position, all decisions need to be cast upon the background of the growing person at the centre of care and ethical concern. Given the social and medico-legal complexities, sensitive, open and robust communication is of paramount importance so that the patient, family and team are not paralysed by this complexity.\n\nOver time, the Australasian approach to interventions for DSD have evolved for such reasons as:5\n\n\n  Cessation of the practice of removing gonads solely to align with sex of rearing.6\n  Developments in genetics and immunohistochemistry that have allowed for more sophisticated risk stratification of oncogenic potential.7\n  Acknowledgement of patient groups advocating for deferral of surgery as well as a lack of universal definition of ‘medically necessary surgery.’\n\n\nThis is in the context of a lack of longitudinal studies articulating the impact of surgery or deferral of surgery.\n\nWithout robust evidence to clearly guide optimal management, consideration of surgery for infants with a DSD seeks to strike a balance among known and potential benefits and risks. Benefits may include:8\n\n\n  Minimising physical risks—e.g., removing gonads with significant oncogenic potential, and inability for adequate surveillance3 due to gonadal position\n  Function—e.g., promotion of fertility potential with orchidopexy\n\n\nThe potential for reduction of negative psychosocial impacts on the growing person remains a consideration which is contended. This is because though negative psychosocial impacts can exist, they arise predominantly from external societal stigma.\n\nRisks may include:\n\n\n  Infants and young children have not yet developed gender identity or had opportunity to express it.\n  The young person may experience psychological injury from imposition of gender and/or sex-aligning surgery.\n  Fertility options may be reduced.\n  The generic and procedure-specific complications of surgery; both short- and long-term.\n  Early surgery excludes the young person from participation in decision-making about their body and health.\n\n\nHistorically, surgery was performed in infancy to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections and create a genital appearance that more closely aligned with the sex of rearing. However, although psychological benefits to the child and family are often cited, they remain unproven.9 Conversely, there is evidence that surgery performed during childhood has been associated with poor cosmetic outcome (41%) and requirement for further major surgery (89%).10 Concerns regarding poor clinical outcomes from surgery in infancy have been replicated.11\n\nIn 2017 a joint consensus statement by Australian and Aotearoa/New Zealand intersex organisations and independent advocates set out the priorities and calls by the intersex human rights movement in our region.12 This stated that irreversible surgical procedures that are not medically urgent should only be performed at an age when the individual themself can make informed decisions about surgical options. In 2021 the Australian Human Rights Commission published a detailed analysis of the rights of the child to participate in decision making regarding medically unnecessary surgery, recommending independent oversight of the multidisciplinary team with criminal penalties where surgery is performed without medical necessity.13\n\n\n\nCase 1\n\n\n  A 6 year old 46XX female with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) presents to the multidisciplinary clinic with Prader 5 virilization on physical exam. She is well controlled on mineralocorticoid therapy. The patient is not aware of her diagnosis, but parents are very insistent on surgery to “make her look like a girl.”\n\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, this case would be formally presented for discussion at a multi-institution DSD multi-disciplinary team meeting. Members of the team include: endocrinologists, urologists, gynaecologists, allied health, ethicists, geneticists, nurses, researchers, and patient care managers. At this age, decisions should be deferred until adolescence when the young person can be the central decision-maker.14,15\n\nFrom a practical perspective, it is clear the parents’ wishes for intervention will need careful management in this scenario. Opportunity must be given for the parents to express their concerns, and time taken to explain the rationale for awaiting the child’s agency in the decision. Psychological support is often crucial and also providing an opportunity for the family to connect with peer support. Throughout this journey, the emphasis is on the child’s wellbeing and right to autonomy as the centre of care and concern.\n\n\n\nCase 2\n\n\n  A 13 year old female-appearing patient presented for workup of amenorrhea was found to have a 46XY karyotype and was diagnosed with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). Her parents were informed of the diagnosis and they do not want the provider team to tell the patient about the diagnosis.\n\n\nEthics of Disclosure\n\nThe parental instinct to “protect” a child from the psychological impact of this diagnosis is understandable’ however, there are a myriad of reasons why it is important to tell truth about the diagnosis of CAIS, in an age-appropriate manner.\n\nAccording to The Royal Australasian College of Physicians; “consideration must be given to the rights of all children and adolescents to be involved in decision-making about their own health. In particular, cognitively mature adolescents have the right to make decisions relating to their own health and to maintain their privacy, including in respect to their parents/carers”.16\n\nTelling truth to young people with respect to their health promotes an age-appropriate contribution to decision-making, encourages their involvement in the therapeutic relationship, avoids restriction of future autonomy, demonstrates respect for the child as a person, improves well-being, instantiates truthfulness and fidelity.17 When these compelling reasons are presented to the parents, with time and space to comprehend them, agreement to an open conversation is nearly always achieved.\n\nSurgical Aspects of Care\n\nManagement of the intra-abdominal testis:\n\n\n  The risk of malignant change in CAIS is very low (&lt;1%).18 However the risk of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) with intra-abdominal gonads is much higher (up to 50%). It would therefore be important to confirm clinically and via mutational analysis that the diagnosis is CAIS.\n  Leaving the testes in-situ has become common practice in confirmed CAIS19 as this facilitates spontaneous breast development and bone mass accrual through endogenous oestradiol created from peripheral aromatisation of high circulating levels of testosterone.18\n  The optimal strategy for surveillance14 remains ill-defined. For impalpable gonads, ultrasound assessment, biopsy to stratify or detect malignant change,20 and surveillance for germ cell tumour markers in the serum or semen18 may have a role.\n\n\nPromoting capacity for satisfying sexual relations.\n\nIndividuals with AIS can have satisfying sexual relationships, whether or not they decide to use their vagina. For those who do, most individuals have adequate vaginal capacity for intercourse. A minority will have a degree of vaginal hypoplasia which may make penetrative intercourse challenging.21,22 In selected cases, serial self-dilatation may be helpful if the person wishes to increase vaginal length. Only rarely is surgery required.23,24 Psychosocial supports such as counseling, peer support and gynaecology involvement may assist with this process.\n\nSouth American Perspective\n\nBy Francisca Yankovic, MD, MSc\n\nSocial and medico-legal issues are perhaps some of the most important challenges to adequate management of children with variations of sex development (VSD). Latin America, and in particular Chile, has not been exempt from the controversies that have arisen worldwide regarding the question of performing irreversible surgeries that seek to \"normalize\" the appearance of the external genitalia in children with VSD.\n\nIn line with international human rights groups, in our country, there is a milestone that marks a change in urological/medical practice for patients with VSD. In 2015, a report by the International Convention on the Rights of the Child of the United Nations stated that “The State Party (Chile) expedites the development and implementation of a rights-based health-care protocol for intersex children that sets the procedures and steps to be followed by health teams in order to ensure that no one is subjected to unnecessary surgery or treatment during infancy or childhood, protect the rights of the children concerned to physical and mental integrity, autonomy and self-determination, provide intersex children and their families with adequate counseling and support, including from peers, and ensure effective remedy for victims, including redress and compensation”.25 This recommendation generated a wave of reactions, and the Ministry of Health, in hand with human rights groups, has instructed health care providers to stop all irreversible surgical procedures for intersex children.26 However, in this discussion, the medical community and many patients and their families felt marginalized. After an interdisciplinary roundtable was held, this prohibition was amended, and new recommendations for the surgical treatment of children with VSD were set3. As medical professionals, we must recognize that the UN report was very useful in guiding thinking and in trying to optimize the management of children born with VSD in Chile. By focusing on the interdisciplinary management of such cases at specialized centers, by respecting the individuality of each case, and by analyzing the family and social environment before drawing a plan of management, this new approach is widening the management options, avoiding irreversible procedures, and generating greater awareness and acceptance of diversity among Chilean health providers.\n\n\n\nCase 1\n\n\n  A 6-year-old 46 XX female with congenital adrenal hyperplasia presented to the multidisciplinary clinic with Prader 5 virilization on physical exam. She was well controlled on mineralocorticoid therapy. The patient was not aware of her diagnosis, but her parents were very insistent on surgery to “make her look like a girl.”\n\n\nIn Chile, the surgical treatment for patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a matter of debate. From the legal framework, neither public nor private medical practitioners are formally prohibited from performing genital surgeries in children with VSD2.27 However, the growing concern of different social actors about performing irreversible genital surgeries in children without their consent implies that the surgical option always requires consent after a detailed explanation of the risks/benefits of the surgery and in agreement with the health team and the family. In Chile, many parents and girls with CAH continue to support early surgery in infancy for the correction of urogenital sinus and clitoral reduction. This opinion is also shared by most pediatric urologists in Chile, who argue that the incidence of gender dysphoria in patients with CAH is low.27 From a social point of view, as Chile is a country that is strongly linked to the Catholic Church and that has a rather conservative profile, the Chilean community is just beginning to open up to diversity. On the other hand, growing immigration, mainly from Haiti and Venezuela, poses new challenges related to the integration of sociocultural differences.\n\nIn the proposed clinical scenario, the benefits of postponing the surgery until the patient could consent were discussed in detail with the family. It is likely that after presenting this case to the VSD interdisciplinary team, if the identity of the patient is female and there is good adherence to treatment, the surgical alternative will also be offered.\n\n\n\nCase 2\n\n\n  A 13-year-old female-appearing patient who presented for workup of amenorrhea was found to have a 46 XY karyotype and was diagnosed with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Her parents were informed of the diagnosis, and they did not want the provider team to tell the patient about the diagnosis.\n\n\nThis clinical scenario is a challenge that perhaps all clinicians who take care of patients with VSD have faced. From a legal point of view, the Law of Rights and Duties for Medical Care in Chile establishes that “Everyone has the right to be informed, in a timely and understandable manner, by the doctor or other treating professional (…), according to their age and personal and emotional condition”.28 Although the minimum age to consent to medical treatment is not defined, since there may be variations regarding mental and emotional development in children, Chilean law establishes the presumption that adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age have the necessary intellectual and volitional aptitude to give consent by themselves.29 In patients under 14 years of age, such as the one presented in this case, it is recommended to consider the opinion of minors, but from a legal point of view, the child’s opinion is nonbinding. The physician-patient relationship in Chile has evolved from very marked paternalism toward a progressive respect for the patient's autonomy. However, the tendency to hide “high impact” diagnoses persists not only in children but also in the adult population. The social factors mentioned in the previous case are also valid for this clinical scenario, where lack of awareness about VSD in the general population and the low acceptance of diversity plays a predominant role when parents face this diagnosis. However, health providers are conscious of the importance of early disclosure of diagnosis to patients with VSD. For this reason, in the presented case, the recommendation to the family would be to visit the mental health team to help them find tools to facilitate the process. On the other hand, the positive aspects of early disclosure should be emphasized, not only from the legal and ethical framework but also from the experience of patients with VSD who have reached adulthood without knowing their diagnosis. For that reason, a joint plan should be executed, delineating a timetable for the family to gradually tell their daughter about her diagnosis. The medical team must be available at all times, providing emotional support and empowering the patient to learn more about their condition.\n\nReferences\n\n\nHealth &amp; Human Services VD of.

        "content": "Tumors of the Adrenal Gland: Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma\n\nIntroduction\n\nPheochromocytoma (PCC) is a catecholamine secreting tumor. There are limited data available concerning management of this rare tumor in children and adolescents. Management is usually extrapolated from a combination of the adult guidelines and case reports/series. In the pediatric population, surgery is the mainstay of treatment, but there are recent advances in new treatments and management of metastatic disease.1,2\n\nEmbryology\n\nPCC arises from the adrenal medulla, specifically the chromaffin cells.3 If PCC arises outside the adrenal gland, it is called a paraganglioma (PG).\n\nEpidemiology\n\nOverall, PCC has an annual incidence of 3 in 1 million individuals. Of all PCC diagnoses, 20% occur in children.3 Although patients can be diagnosed at any age, in children, the mean age is 11–13 years.4,5 Patients classically present with symptoms attributable to catecholamine excess: hypertension, headache, palpations, tremor, excessive sweating and facial pallor.6 These symptoms can be episodic, but in children, they are more likely to be sustained.6 Up to 2% of children with hypertension may have catecholamine secreting tumors compared to this being a rare cause (&lt;1%) in adults.6\n\nPathogenesis\n\nDiscussion of PCC centers around genetic predisposition. Despite the classic “rule of 10s” for PCC, about 40% of pediatric PCCs have a hereditary disposition. (Table 1) describes the known genetic syndromes associated with PCC.3,7 The genetic link is so strong that up to 70–80% of pediatric patients with PCC or PG have an associated germline mutation. These germline mutations may or may not be a genetic syndrome or hereditary in nature.4,8,9 In one study of 49 patients age &lt;20y with PCC or PG, almost 80% had a germline mutation involving Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH), von Hippel Lindau (VHL), or Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1).8 When tested for RET (rearranged during transfection), VHL, and SDH mutations, 70% of patients &lt;10y, 51% of patients 10–20y and 16% of patients &gt;20y had an identifiable germline mutation.9 Considering this strong association, all children, adolescents and young adults with PCC or PG should undergo genetic testing.10 Similarly, for patients with either a family history or known genetic disposition (ex. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and VHL) should undergo regular screening, usually biochemical testing annually beginning at age 5y.11\n\nMEN2 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an activating mutation in the RET oncogene. There is a &gt;50% risk of developing PCC.3,5 About 20% of patients with MEN2B develop PCC, and all were associated with the classic M918T RET mutation.12 The majority are diagnosed with screening and few experience clinical symptoms, illustrating the importance of screening for early diagnosis.\n\nApproximately 10–20% of patients with VHL will develop PCC or PG.3 Children with VHL may present with PCC as the event that triggers a VHL diagnosis. These presentations may be atypical, including weight loss,13 metastatic disease without symptoms after screening started,14 and bilateral PCC.15\n\nAlthough less common, patients with NF1 have an increased risk of developing PCC.16 Usually this is diagnosed at an older age and rarely in children.11 As such, for patients with NF1 biochemical screening should begin at age 10y.16\n\nGermline mutations of SDH complex genes and their association with PCC is a more recent discovery. It seems that a SDHA or B mutation is associated with a higher prevalence of aggressive and metastatic disease.8 As such, asymptomatic carriers are often identified through genetic testing of family members with related diseases.17 PCC associated with SDH mutations are generally biochemically silent, which necessitates serial imaging. In general, abdominal MRI every 18 months and MRI of the neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis every 3 years is recommended.17\n\nRecently, there have been cases suggesting some type of a relationship between PCC/PG and cyanotic congenital heart disease.18 The theory is that there may be a link between hypoxia-induced cellular pathways and tumorigensis.19\n\nTable 1 Characteristics and screening recommendations of syndromes associated with PCC (Peard, Cost, Saltzman Curr Opin Urol 2019)\n\n\n  \n    \n      Disease\n      Genetic mutation\n      Stigmata of Disease\n      Rate of PCC or PG\n      Surveillance\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      VHL\n      VHL  tumor suppressor (Colvin)\n      Central nervous system and retinal hemangiomas, renal cell carcinoma, PCC, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, cysts (Dias Pereira)\n      10% (PDQ)\n      Plasma or urine metanephrines annually starting at age 5y (Jain)\n    \n    \n      MEN2A\n      RET oncogene activation (Bholah)\n      Medullary thyroid carcinoma, PCC, primary hyperparathyroidism (Dias Pereira)\n      68% (Dias Pereira)\n      Plasma or urine metanephrines annually starting at age 5y (Jain)\n    \n    \n      MEN2B\n      RET oncogene activation (Makri)\n      Medullary thyroid carcinoma, PCC, multiple neuromas, marfanoid habitus (Bholah)\n      50% (Makri)\n      Plasma or urine metanephrines annually starting at age 5y (Jain)\n    \n    \n      NF-1\n      NF1 gene mutation (Gruber)\n      Café au lait lesions, axillary/inguinal freckling, neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, osseous lesions, PCC, GIST, melanoma, breast, lung, colorectal carcinomas (Dias pereira)\n      8% (Dias Pereira)\n      Plasma or urine metanephrines every 3 years starting at age 10y (Gruber)\n    \n    \n      SDH\n      SDH respiratory complex tumor suppressor (Jha)\n      PCC, PG, renal cell carcinoma, GIST (settas)\n      Not yet defined (Chen)\n      SDHB: MRI abdomen q18mos, MRI neck, thorax, pelvis q3y (Tufton) /// SDHA, SDHC, SDHD: require less frequent screening (Tufton)\n    \n    \n      Carney Triad\n      N/A\n      PG, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pulmonary chondromas (PDQ)\n      50% (PDQ)\n      No defined screening\n    \n  \n\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nWhile the majority of PCCs are benign, the systemic effects of catecholamine excess can have significant morbidity and mortality.7 Classically described is the “rule of 10s” (Table 2) To distinguish benign from malignant PCC, metastases must be identified.\n\nTable 2 “Rule of 10s”\n\n\n  \n    \n      10%\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Extra adrenal\n    \n    \n      Bilateral or multiple\n    \n    \n      Genetic predisposition (actually 25%)\n    \n    \n      Pediatric\n    \n    \n      Malignant/metastasize (up to 36%)\n    \n    \n      Associated with MEN syndromes\n    \n    \n      Present with stroke\n    \n    \n      Calcified\n    \n    \n      Present without hypertension\n    \n    \n      Recur\n    \n    \n      Found incidentally\n    \n    \n      Discussed 10× more common than actually seen\n    \n  \n\n\nSuggested methods of diagnosis are extrapolated from adult studies, but there is an ongoing debate about preference considering the goal of minimizing radiation exposure in children.\n\nOnce an adrenal mass is discovered, laboratory testing to evaluate for catecholamine excess is necessary. Plasma-free metanephrines or 24-hour urine metanephrines are superior to measurement of plasma catecholamines (i.e., norepinephrine, epinephrine) or urine vanillylmandelic acid, since the latter substances are only episodically released, while the metanephrines are constantly present as degradation products.20\n\nSeveral common medications may cause a false positive result, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic amines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and sympathomimetics including amphetamines, decongestants, caffeine or nicotine.11 Prior to lab testing, these medications should be stopped. Additionally, patients should be fasting and supine for at least 30 minutes prior to lab draw.6,21 Blood draws in the seated position can cause a 5–7 fold increase in the rate of false positive results.22\n\nPediatric-specific reference ranges are nebulous and false-positives are high. In general, a false positive should be considered if levels are &lt;3-4 times normal and testing should be repeated.\n\nPatients with laboratory confirmed catecholamine excess need cross sectional imaging. This should be either CT or MRI of the abdomen, with &gt;90% sensitivity for adrenal PCC detection.5 On T2 MRI, PCC is very bright, called the lightbulb sign. For patients with a high suspicion for PCC but inconclusive biochemical testing, and to assess for metastasis, multifocal disease, or regional extension, functional imaging is indicated. This includes 123I- or 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and positron emission tomography (PET).5 Both PET and 123I-MIBG are sensitive tests for tumor localization but PET is preferred for identifying metastatic disease.23 Head-to-head comparisons of various types of cross-sectional imaging with or without radiopharmaceuticals have shown the superiority of Ga-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)-octreotate (Ga-DOTATATE) PET scans for localizing metastatic PCC and other paragangliomas.\n\nTreatment Options and Their Outcomes\n\nSurgical resection is the gold standard treatment for PCC.5 The key to surgical management is the appropriate pre- and perioperative management to preventing sequelae from hypertensive crisis.\n\nWith tumor manipulation by the surgeon, catecholamines may be released in large quantities and cause hypertensive crisis with cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, pulmonary edema, and stroke.11 Various preoperative regimens have been described, but again management of pediatric patients is largely extrapolated from the adult literature.24 In PCC, there is a high level of catecholamines. These cause vasoconstriction of the peripheral vasculature. As such, the patient is hypovolemic. To counteract this, the alpha receptors are blocked, which dilates the peripheral vasculature. To counteract this drop in blood pressure due to hypovolemia, high salt intake and hydration help to increase intravascular volume.5 Options for alpha blockade include phenoxybenzamine, doxazosin, prazosin, or terazosin.6 Alternative regimens include a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitors or calcium channel blockers.25 Following alpha blockade, when hypovolemia is present and the vascular resistance is decreased, tachycardia develops. This may require beta blockade. Patients may be admitted preoperatively for this medical optimization and fluid management if there are concerns about doing this on an outpatient basis.26 Of critical importance to intraoperative safety is pre-surgical optimization, involving endocrinology and/or nephrology and anesthesiology. Postoperatively, patients will need to be monitored for blood pressure control and rebound hypoglycemia, potentially requiring an intensive care unit.\n\nWhen feasible, minimally invasive surgical techniques are preferable for tumor resection.27 However, open resection may be considered for large, locally invasive tumors due to risk of tumor spillage. The approach may be transperitoneal or retroperitoneal depending on surgeon experience.27,28 There is very little literature available evaluating safety of the laparoscopic approach in pediatric patients with PCC, but the few reports appear to yield favorable results and low intraoperative complications.28\n\nCortical sparing surgery (partial adrenalectomy) is recommended for patients with known bilateral disease or patients at high risk of disease recurrence. These would include patients with known hereditary syndromes. To preserve function, about 15% of the adrenal needs to remain.29 However, these patients are at a 10% risk of local recurrence, so need to be followed postoperatively.30\n\nMalignant PCC is defined by distant spread.31 This is significantly higher in children, up to 50% of cases.32,33 Typical sites of metastases are regional lymph nodes, bone, lung and liver. As expected, survival is significantly lower in malignant PCC (31% vs. 100% in benign disease).32 Despite the high rate of metastases, surgical resection of lesions remains the mainstay of treatment mainly because there are no highly successful alternative therapies. There are therapies to control malignant disease if surgical resection is not possible, but pediatric data are limited. In this scenario, despite extrapolation from the adult literature elsewhere, the inherent differences between tumors in adults and children as well as the impact of toxic therapies in the pediatric population must be considered.\n\nHigh dose 131I-MIBG administration can be therapeutic in patients with a positive MIBG and malignant disease.34 The radioactive compound is taken up by the active norepinephrine transporter of PCC cells, targeting radiation directly to the cancer cells. In general, tumor volume remains stable with about half of patients having a partial hormone response without progression of disease. However, studies are limited to it is unclear if this is reflective of natural disease progression or a true response to therapy.34 131I-MIBG therapy carries a risk of secondary malignancy in children, well documented after neuroblastoma treatment, so this risk must be considered.35\n\nRadiotherapy can be used, mainly for palliation. External beam radiation therapy has been used alone or with 131I-MIBG therapy. The goal here is usually maintaining disease stability and less for regression or cure.2\n\nMultiple chemotherapy regimens have been reported. Generally, these include gemcitabine, docetaxel, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine. There are several studies now evaluating guadecitabine, a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but there are limited data supporting its use.\n\nSuggested Follow Up\n\nIn addition to genetic counseling and germline testing, follow up is recommended at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year postoperatively, followed by annual biochemical screening and intermingled abdominal imaging. Follow up involves an inquiry into catecholamine excess symptoms, blood pressure monitoring, and biochemical testing. This follow up is for a lifetime, particularly for recurrent or metastatic disease.6\n\nConclusions\n\nPediatric PCC is rare and most recommendations are extrapolated from adult PCC/PG data. Children with PCC/PG have a high likelihood of an underlying germline mutation, unlike adults, so genetic counseling should be offered. Diagnosis centers on biochemical testing and cross-sectional imaging, followed by surgical resection. Pre-operative optimization and complete surgical resection are essential.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Measure plasma metanephrines and get cross-sectional imaging, ± MIBG or Dotatate PET\n  Alpha blockade, hydration and NaCl replacement, then beta blockade if necessary pre-operatively\n  Resection of lesions is the mainstay of treatment, ideally with minimally invasive methods\n  All pediatric patients with PCC should be referred for genetic counseling/testing\n\n\nWilms’ Tumor\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe vast majority of renal masses found in children are Wilms’ tumor (WT), but several other rare and important diagnoses can be found. These are summarized in (Table 3)\n\nTable 3 Incidence of pediatric renal tumors36\n\n\n  \n    \n      Histology\n      Frequency (%)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Favorable Histology Wilms tumor (WT)\n      75\n    \n    \n      Anaplastic WT\n      5\n    \n    \n      Congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN)\n      2\n    \n    \n      Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK)\n      3\n    \n    \n      Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)\n      4\n    \n    \n      Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK)\n      4\n    \n    \n      Cystic Nephroma\n      2\n    \n    \n      Other\n      5\n    \n  \n\n\nThere exist competing diagnosis and treatment strategies among two international cooperative working groups. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), responsible for treatment guidelines, tumor registries and clinical trials for renal masses in North America, advocate upfront renal mass excision with the interpretation of primary unaltered pathology and staging guiding further treatment. The Société Internationale d’Oncologie Pédiatrique (SIOP), the European equivalent to COG, alternatively advocates for combination vincristine and actinomycin (VA) neoadjuvant chemotherapy for all patients ≥6 months old with a solid renal mass followed by surgery and then histologic evaluation to guide subsequent therapy.37 Regardless of approach, survival appears to be similar, but there are nuances and advantages and disadvantages with both approaches. This chapter will focus on the COG guidelines since the authors practice in North America. It is essential to establish early multidisciplinary care with medical oncologists familiar with local ongoing protocols.\n\nIn general, it is important to keep a wide differential diagnosis for children with renal masses, as surgical decisions can alter staging, treatment decisions and outcomes. Most renal tumors in children are managed with upfront surgery, usually radical nephrectomy and lymph node (LN) sampling. Then once pathology is determined, more nuanced decisions for adjuvant treatment are made. An important exception is for bilateral renal tumors, patients with a solitary kidney, history of a known WT predisposition syndrome, advanced/locally invasive disease, or inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus. These cases are assumed to be WT and are managed by upfront chemotherapy followed by attempts at partial nephrectomy to preserve as much renal tissue as possible.\n\nEmbryology\n\nWT develops from dysregulated growth of primitive renal tissue and shows a triphasic pattern of stromal, blastemal and epithelial components. Histology is then further described as favorable or unfavorable (anaplastic), and this guides treatment and prognosis.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThere are about 500 cases with WT in the USA annually.36 Patients with WT are usually 3–5 years old and most cases are diagnosed before age &lt;10y. African-American children seem to be at higher risk of developing WT, and patients of Asian decent have the lowest risk of WT.\n\nPathogenesis\n\nWhile there are several well described syndromes associated with an increased chance of developing WT, this is seen in the minority of patients with WT. The WT1 gene is critically involved with the development of WT. This is found on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p13). WT1 is a tumor suppressor gene that codes for a transcription factor that is linked to embryologic genitourinary development. Homozygous mutations of WT1, or nearby coding regions, very often results in the patient developing WT.\n\nMultiple genetic syndromes may predispose children to WT, as listed in table 1.37 Patients with predisposition syndromes and bilateral tumors typically present at earlier ages than those without. Screening protocols are often used for these patients to attempt to diagnose tumors at an earlier stage, but whether these impact overall outcomes is unclear. In general, screening protocols involve an abdominal ultrasound every 3–6 months until age 7–10 years.37\n\nTable 4 WT Predisposition Syndromes37\n\n\n  \n    \n      Syndrome\n      Genetics\n      Associated Features\n      Risk of WT (%)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      WAGR\n      11p13, WT1, PAX13\n      WT, Aniridia, Genital abnormalities, Mental delay\n      98\n    \n    \n      Denys Drash\n      WT1\n      WT, Genital abnormalities, Renal failure/nephropathy (mesangial sclerosis)\n      74\n    \n    \n      Beckwith-Weideman\n      11p15.5, WT2\n      Pre-and post-natal overgrowth, Hemihypertrophy (growth asymmetry), Macroglossia, Anterior abdominal wall defects (omphalocele), Ear creases/pits\n      7\n    \n    \n      Frasier syndrome\n      WT1\n      WT, Nephropathy (FSGS), Genital abnormalities, Gonadoblastoma/GCNIS\n      6\n    \n  \n\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nPatients with any renal mass typical present with a palpable abdominal mass. Hematuria, hypertension, abdominal pain may also be present. It is important to ask about hematuria specifically, as if this is present, the surgeon may consider cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography at the beginning of the case to rule out ureteral tumor extension, which is seen in 2-5% of patients.37 This may have implications of the level at which the ureter is amputated to avoid intraoperative tumor spillage.\n\nLaboratory studies should include complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel and urinalysis. Coagulation studies are critical as an acquired von Willebrand disease is seen in 4–8% of patients with WT.37\n\nThe initial imaging modality of choice for a patient with any suspected intra-abdominal mass should be an abdominal ultrasound which then guides further cross-sectional imaging.37 When a solid renal mass is found, a single CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with iv contrast should be done for staging. For patients with bilateral renal masses, or for patients with another contraindication for CT scan, an abdominal and pelvic MRI with IV contrast is appropriate. Importantly for these patients, CT of the chest is still necessary to complete staging.37 On preoperative imaging, it is important to look for signs of preoperative rupture, enlarged LNs, tumor thrombus in the renal vein or IVC, and for any renal masses in the contralateral kidney. It is critical to note findings in the contralateral kidney as this changes the approach entirely, to chemotherapy first followed by surgery. Venous tumor thrombus presence will affect surgical planning, and if this extends into the IVC and especially near the level of the hepatic veins, consideration for chemotherapy prior to surgery is encouraged to avoid cardiac bypass. While imaging findings suspicious for preoperative rupture have low sensitivity (CT 76% and MRI 53%) and are not used for final staging, they can provide guidance as to what the surgeon may encounter in the operating room.38 Assessment of the involvement of other organs is also important, but keep in mind that WT rarely invades surrounding structures, but rather displaces them.\n\nTreatment Options and Their Outcomes\n\nPre-operative clinical staging and decisions have significant impact on treatment strategies, as outlined in (Table 5)\n\nThe standard of care according to COG surgical protocols for the initial treatment of unilateral, non-syndromic WT is open radical nephrectomy with regional LN sampling. Notably, pre-operative renal mass biopsy is considered spillage of tumor, and results in clinical upstaging to stage III. Biopsy is rarely used in COG protocols due to the intensification of chemotherapy and radiation with upstaging, both of which have significant side effects. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be considered in locally advanced, unresectable tumors, and always with bilateral tumors. Those with venous tumor thrombus into the IVC at or above the hepatic venous confluence or those with overwhelming liver or lung metastases that compromise normal function, based on surgeon and/or anesthesia judgement, may also benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nIn countries were the SIOP UMBRELLA protocol is being followed, dual agent Vincristine and Actinomycin-D neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients older than 6 months of age with localized tumors is the standard of care. The goal of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is to down-stage the tumor as well as aid in the ease of surgical resection. Patients with metastatic disease receive additional Doxorubicin neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Nephrectomy is planned between weeks 5 and 8 depending on tumor stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy is based on the final tumor stage and histology.\n\nRadical nephrectomy, with sparing of the adrenal gland if feasible, should be performed via an open transperitoneal abdominal approach. It is important to palpate the surface of the liver and peritoneal surfaces, biopsying any nodules that are felt. Inspect the peritoneal fluid and if bloody, consider declaring pre-operative rupture vs. sending to pathology for cytology to identify any malignant cells. Carefully document any surrounding structures invasion and palpate the renal vein and IVC to identify any venous tumor thrombus. Routine exploration of the contralateral kidney is unnecessary with modern use of preoperative cross-sectional imaging. Although LN sampling is mandated as part of COG surgical protocols, under sampling or omission of LN sampling is the most common protocol violation. In general, at least 6-10 LNs need to be examined in order to achieve an acceptable false negative rate.39 Additionally, LN positivity is one of the most common criteria for Stage III disease and has been shown to be an independent predictor of survival when compared to other Stage III variables.40\n\nSpecial Treatment Scenarios\n\nIn general, nephron-sparring surgery (NSS, partial nephrectomy) is reserved for patients with solitary kidneys, bilateral (stage V) or syndromic tumors and is often preceded by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in an attempt to improve feasibility of NSS. Importantly, biopsy before chemotherapy when WT is the overwhelming likely diagnosis (i.e., age 1–7y), is NOT advocated, as this will result in adjuvant therapy intensification as well. If there is not at least a partial response in tumor size (partial response is ≥30% total tumor size reduction) after 6 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy, consider open renal biopsy to identify either anaplasia or other histology that would change management. LN sampling on both sides is also important in NSS for the treatment of bilateral tumors.\n\nAnother important group of patients eligible for treatment modification includes children classified as having very low-risk WT (VLRWT). To meet the criteria for VLRWT, the patient must be &lt;2y at the time of diagnosis and have a Stage I favorable histology WT that weighs &lt;550g. These patients have been shown to have equivalent event free and overall survival (90% and 100% at 4 years) with nephrectomy alone, thus avoiding some of the potential long-term side effects of chemoradiation therapy. Future COG studies will likely expand on the criteria for surgery alone, but these protocols have not been fully developed yet.\n\nStaging is finalized using several factors, described both by the pathologist and the surgeon at the time of surgery. Surgeon findings are emphasized over imaging findings due to poor sensitivity of cross-sectional imaging to estimate things like spillage, lymphadenopathy, surrounding tissue invasion, etc. As with pre-operative renal mass biopsy, intraabdominal tumor implants or pre-operative rupture/intra-operative spill confers clinical stage III disease, all of which are independently associated with poor survival.37\n\nThe most important factor affecting prognosis and treatment is anaplasia, or unfavorable histology.37 Additionally, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for both chromosomes 1p and 16q is associated with increased risk of relapse and cancer-specific mortality37 and leads to adjuvant chemotherapy intensification. Gain of chromosome 1q has also been shown to be predictive of worse event-free and overall survival and is a more common alteration than the combined LOH abnormalities at 1p and 16q (1q Gain 28% vs combined LOH 11%). Currently, no treatment or staging alterations are based on gain of 1q, but this gene target may be incorporated into future treatment algorithms and study protocols.\n\nTable 5 Therapy and clinical outcomes by Wilms’ tumor stage.37 VA = vincristine + actinomycin, VAD = vincristine + actinomycin + doxorubicin, XRT = external beam radiation, FH = favorable histology, UH = unfavorable histology, ° - Chemotherapeutic agent only, not regimen.

Because of the excellent outcomes, COG study now focuses on decreasing long term morbidity from treatment. The important complications seen by patients treated with WT are CKD, secondary malignancies from both chemotherapy and radiation, cardiac toxicity from doxorubicin and infertility due to chemoradiation exposure.37\n\nSuggested Follow Up\n\nVarious follow-up recommendations exist for surveillance imaging after treatment for WT, with most protocols highlighting the need for more intense surveillance during the first 2 years after treatment. Surveillance imaging options include abdominal ultrasound and chest X-ray screening every 3–6 months for the first 3–4 years followed by yearly imaging after that. Alternatively, cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI may also be used in surveillance protocols, particularly in high-risk patients or those with indeterminant findings on US or X-ray.\n\nOutside of the standard post-operative clinic visits to assess for immediate and long-term surgical complications or disease recurrence, COG has also published long-term follow-up guidelines that cover treatment and organ specific follow-up recommendations aimed at identifying patients at a high risk for long-term complications ranging from non-target organ dysfunction to mental health and infertility issues.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Evaluation for a suspected intra-abdominal mass should always begin with ultrasound\n  Open surgery is the standard of care for removal of a pediatric renal tumor\n  Avoid biopsy unless absolutely necessary and subsequent results will likely alter management\n  Always remember to perform LN sampling at the time of surgery\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Saltzman AF, Cost NG.

RCC is similar in appearance to WT on standard CT or MRI and should be taken into consideration during the evaluation of a suspected renal malignancy, especially in adolescent children and young adults. Unlike their adult counterparts, pediatric RCC tends to follow a more aggressive clinical course in large part due to differences in the molecular biology of these tumors.\n\nEmbryology\n\nMultiple genetic mutations have been associated with predisposition syndromes for sub-types of RCC (Table 6)\n\nTable 6 Genetic syndromes associated with RCC.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Genetic  Predisposition Syndrome\n      Gene\n      Presentation\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Von Hippel Lindau\n      VHL (3p)\n      Clear cell RCC, Retinal and CNS hemangioblastomasm pheochromocytomas, pancreatic cysts/tumors, epididymal cystadenomas\n    \n    \n      Tuberous Sclerosis\n      TSC1 or TSC2\n      AMLs, clear cell RCC, seizures, mental  retardation, facial angiofibromas, hamartomas\n    \n    \n      Hereditary Papillary RCC\n      MET\n      Low grade type 1 papillary RCC\n    \n    \n      Birt-Hogg-Dubé\n      FLCN\n      Chromophobe RCC, fibrofolliculomas, lung  cysts and blebs\n    \n    \n      Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and RCC\n      FH\n      High grade type 2 papillary RCC, uterine  fibroids at young age, cutaneous leiomyomas\n    \n    \n      Succinate  Dehydrogenase RCC\n      SDH\n      Different RCCs, paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas\n    \n    \n      Sickle hemoglobinopathy\n      Hemoglobin-Beta (11p)\n      Renal Medullary Carcinoma\n    \n  \n\n\nEpidemiology\n\nRCC is the second most common renal tumor in children, accounting for about 4% of cases. The median age at presentation is 12.9 years, and after age 12y, it is the most common pathology found.37,41 No significant gender or racial predilection has been described.\n\nPathogenesis\n\nUnlike adult tumors where clear cell RCC is the most common RCC subtype (75–88%), the most common histology in children and young adults is translocation RCC (tRCC, 50%). These tumors have activating mutations of TFE3 on Xp11.2. This causes continuous tyrosine kinase activity and downstream mTOR pathway activation which results in cellular proliferation. This is a common pathway for RCC development. Despite these tumors often being smaller than their WT counterparts, they are aggressive and associated with locally advanced or metastatic disease in 63% of children.37\n\nThis type of tumor is unique in that patients who have received chemotherapeutic drugs during treatment of other malignancies are at higher risk of later developing TFE+RCC. There are several case reports detailing the development of translocation RCC after treatment for neuroblastoma, among others.\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nWhile most adult tumors are identified incidentally, pediatric RCCs commonly present with symptom, namely a palpable mass or gross hematuria. Laboratory work up is the same as for WT (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel and urinalysis). Like for WT, abdominal US should be the first imaging modality, followed by complete staging with CT chest and either CT or MRI with intravenous contrast of the abdomen and pelvis. Staging and grading systems are the same as those used for adult RCC (Table 7)\n\nWhile NSS and minimally invasive approaches for adult RCC are considered standard of care, their role in pediatric RCC is less clear. The reason for this is likely multifactorial. This disease is rare, and the pathology is not known preoperatively. WT COG surgical protocols emphasize open, radical nephrectomy for the initial treatment of a suspected renal malignancy, which limits the widespread use of laparoscopy and NSS in general for pediatric RCC, despite the familiarity with urologists with this technique.\n\nTable 7 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM Staging for Renal Cell Carcinoma (7th Edition)\n\n\n  \n    \n      Stage\n      Definitiion\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      T1a\n      Tumor confined to kidney, &lt;4 cm\n    \n    \n      T1b\n      Tumor confined to kidney, ≥4 cm but &lt;7 cm\n    \n    \n      T2a\n      Tumor  confined to kidney, ≥7 cm but &lt;10  cm\n    \n    \n      T2b\n      Tumor  confined to kidney, ≥10 cm\n    \n    \n      T3a\n      Tumor extends grossly into renal vein or its segmental branches, or tumor invades perirenal and/or renal sinus fat but not beyond Gerota’s fascia\n    \n    \n      T3b\n      Spread to infra-diaphragmatic IVC\n    \n    \n      T3c\n      Spread to supra-diaphragmatic IVC or IVC wall invasion\n    \n    \n      T4\n      Involvement  of ipsilateral adrenal gland or invades beyond Gerota’s fascia\n    \n    \n      Nodal Stage\n       \n    \n    \n      N0\n      No nodal involvement\n    \n    \n      N1\n      Metastatic  involvement of regional LN\n    \n    \n      Metastasis Stage\n       \n    \n    \n      M0\n      No distant metastases\n    \n    \n      M1\n      Distant  metastases\n    \n    \n      Stage  Groupings\n       \n    \n    \n      Stage I\n      T1 N0 M0\n    \n    \n      Stage  II\n      T2 N0 M0\n    \n    \n      Stage III\n      T3 or N1 with M0\n    \n    \n      Stage  IV\n      T4 or M1\n    \n  \n\n\nTreatment Options and Outcomes\n\nAs mentioned previously, surgery is the mainstay of treatment. It is critical that a multi-disciplinary discussion be had between the surgeon and the oncologist to ensure that any possible surgical decisions made (nephron sparing surgery (NSS) vs. radical nephrectomy (RN), laparoscopy vs. open) or necessitated by the pathology that results from surgery (i.e., positive margin) are considered preoperatively. The downstream consequences of decisions should always be considered up front, as this may change the subsequent treatment, eligibility for research studies, or outcomes.\n\nSurgical treatment revolves around radical nephrectomy versus NSS, and consideration for laparoscopy should be careful and conservative. LN sampling is again imperative for translocation RCC in children, and unlike adult RCC where LNs are rarely involved if not clinically suspicious preoperatively, pre-operative staging imaging has low sensitivity (57%) for identifying the high rate (48%) of LN involvement for cT1 tumors. Extending beyond just children, LN sampling should be strongly encouraged, for both diagnostic and therapeutic reasons, in patients &lt;40 years of age with a suspicious renal mass.37 More recent COG data from AREN0321 suggest that complete surgical resection of disease, including all metastatic sites, and therefore presumably any involved LNs, confers a significant survival advantage, highlighting the importance of careful surgical planning and adherence to current protocols.\n\n5-year overall survival is 71–100% for patients with pT1–3 disease, 55% for patients with LN metastases and just 8% for patients with distant disease. Overall survival trends are lower in children stage-for-stage when compared to adult patients with RCC, a direct correlate to the increased prevalence of tRCC in the younger patient cohort. Traditional adjuvant therapy for adults, such as tyrosine kinase and mammalian target of Rapamycin inhibitors, may be used with advanced disease or adverse pathology, but data are limited in children. The only reported cases of survival in widely metastatic translocation RCC involve complete surgical resection (primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, and metastatic lesions). AREN 1721, a current COG study, is currently examining the benefit of immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced translocation-RCC, which hopefully will add another treatment option for patients with more widespread disease.\n\nComplications\n\nComplications of treatment for RCC are similar to those for WT, namely CKD and surgical complications such as bowel obstruction, bleeding, adjacent organ injury, urine leak, etc. Since chemotherapy and radiation are rarely used for this type of tumor, there are not associated side effects from these treatments.\n\nConclusions\n\nPediatric RCC, although not as common as WT, is a very important entity that every pediatric surgeon and urologist should be aware of when treating pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with renal tumors. Since these tumors are often indistinguishable from other histologic variants of renal malignancies, RCC should be kept in the differential diagnosis, especially when treating children older than 12 years of age. Because surgery is the mainstay of treatment, careful adherence to surgical protocols with the careful use of NSS approaches only after thorough multi-disciplinary discussions is vital.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Begin work up with abdominal US, single arterial phase CT chest, abdomen, pelvis with IV contrast; MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is an acceptable alternative to abdominopelvic imaging\n  Initial treatment is surgical\n  Multi-disciplinary discussion of radical nephrectomy vs. NSS and open vs. laparoscopy is important with the treating oncology team\n  Always sample regional LNs, regardless of preoperative imaging appearance as this has low sensitivity\n  Small masses often have involved LNs, regardless of preoperative imaging appearance\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Saltzman AF, Cost NG.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nUrothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) in the pediatric population is very rare with an incidence of roughly 0.1%-0.4%. A 2019 review found only 243 documented cases of UCC in patients &lt;18y of age, with the mean age being 12.5y, and there is a male predominance (3:1). Overall, recurrence of UCC in the pediatric population is thought to be low (8.6%), and death very uncommon, &lt;4%. Given its rarity, there are no published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of UCC in the pediatric population. This chapter aims to outline etiology and pathogenesis, evaluation and diagnosis, management, and follow up of pediatric UCC currently published literature.\n\nEtiology/Pathogenesis\n\nThere are well-defined risk factors for UCC development in adults including smoking, exposures to various workplace chemicals such as aniline dyes and textile plant chemicals, phenacetin, and exposures to chemotherapy or radiation. Genetic conditions have also been linked to the development of bladder UCC in adults, namely Lynch syndrome, Cowden disease, and presence of UCC in first-degree relative. In children, genetic and environmental risk factors are not well studied, but extrapolated from adults. Early tobacco exposure, cancer-predisposition syndromes (e.g. Costello syndrome), abnormal bladder development, radiation exposure, cyclophosphamide exposure, and parasitic infections have been attributable risk factors for the development of UCC in children. Despite these however, no obvious known risk factors may be present in nearly 87% of pediatric patients with UCC.\n\nRisk factors for recurrence and bladder cancer-related death in the pediatric population include family history of UCC, high-grade histology, and larger tumors at diagnosis. Recurrence and death are rare, so again, these factors are generally extrapolated from the adult literature.\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nPatient Presentation\n\nSimilar to adults, pediatric patients often present with painless gross hematuria (90%) although irritative voiding symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency may also be common. Delay in diagnosis by at least 1 year has been reported in up to 26% of patients given the rarity of this diagnosis in children and the generally benign differential diagnoses for gross hematuria in a child (e.g. benign urethrorrhagia, trauma, urinary tract infections, congenital urologic anomalies, intrinsic renal disease, voiding dysfunction, etc.).\n\nUCC typically presents as a solitary bladder tumor in children compared to multifocality in adults (94% vs. 6%). 93.4% of tumors are low-grade (pTa or pT1), and there is usually no evidence of nodal involvement or metastasis. (Table 1) outlines the American Join Committee on Cancer (AJCC) bladder cancer staging.\n\nTable 1 AJCC Urothelial cell carcinoma staging\n\n\n  \n    \n      T stage\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Ta\n      Noninvasive papillary carcinoma\n    \n    \n      Tis\n      Carcinoma in situ (CIS)\n    \n    \n      T1\n      Tumor invades lamina propria\n    \n    \n      T2\n      Tumor invades muscularis propria\n    \n    \n      T2a\n      Tumor invades superficial muscularis propria (inner half)\n    \n    \n      T2b\n      Tumor invades deep muscularis propria (outer half)\n    \n    \n      T3\n      Tumor invades perivesical tissue/fat\n    \n    \n      T3a\n      Tumor invades perivesical tissue/fat microscopically\n    \n    \n      T3b\n      Tumor invades perivesical tissue fat macroscopically (extravesical mass)\n    \n    \n      T4\n      Tumor invades prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, or abdominal wall\n    \n    \n      T4a\n      Tumor invades adjacent organs (uterus, ovaries, prostate stroma)\n    \n    \n      T4b\n      Tumor invades pelvic wall and/or abdominal wall\n    \n  \n\n\nInitial Evaluation\n\nThe 2020 AUA guidelines on non-muscle invasive UCC stipulate clear recommendations on evaluation of adult patients with gross hematuria including cystoscopy, upper tract imaging with CT or MR urography, and occasionally the use of urine cytology. Given the natural progression of UCC in pediatric patients, i.e. generally low grade tumors that do not recur, the initial workup of a pediatric patient with gross hematuria is often approached less aggressively.\n\nEvaluation should begin with a history and physical exam. Additional investigative modalities at the first visit include urinalysis (with particular attention given to presence/quantity of red blood cells and indicators of infection such as leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and bacteria), urine culture, and bladder/renal ultrasound.\n\nUrinalysis can confirm ongoing microscopic hematuria and help to rule out other potential causes of hematuria, including medical renal disease or infection. The urine culture would confirm no infection is present. Bladder/renal ultrasound can determine upper and lower tract anatomy and evaluate potential causes of gross hematuria. Given the smaller body habitus of children, this modality can be very sensitive in detecting small luminal tumors.\n\nImaging, Cystoscopy and Cytology\n\nIn the adult population, cystoscopy is the gold standard for the detection of bladder tumors and upper tract imaging in the form of CT or MR urography is standard to image the upper tracts. In the pediatric population there are considerations that must be weighed, including the requirement for general anesthesia for cystoscopy, sedation for imaging with CT or MRI, and radiation exposure with CT.\n\nThere have been a few studies evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in evaluation of both upper and lower urinary tracts for detection of masses in children. Bladder ultrasound has been found to have sensitivity of 83-93% in detecting bladder tumors with 93-100% specificity and has detected bladder lesions as small as 5mm. When considering the cumulative radiation dose a pediatric patient may acquire for UCC surveillance over many years, ultrasound becomes an attractive modality both for an initial screening test upon presentation with gross hematuria but also for surveillance of mass recurrence following resection.\n\nCystoscopy is indicated for patients for whom a bladder lesion was detected on ultrasound or for those with persistent hematuria without any other explanation. In pediatric patients, tumors are usually solitary, non-invasive, and approximately 52% of them are found on the lateral walls (Figure 1) Cystoscopy in children requires anesthesia, thus cystoscopy is often performed with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) as an expected part of the procedure. Tissue is required to establish a diagnosis and depth of invasion (T stage). This is also the initial treatment to remove the entire tumor.\n\n \nFigure 1 Examples of bladder tumors. Bladder tumors are often solitary and papillary (a, b) and can be harder to identify in patients who have undergone bladder augmentation (c, d).\n\nThere is minimal role for urine cytology in pediatric patients as these bladder tumors are typically low-grade and the sensitivity of cytology for low-grade tumors is quite low.\n\nManagement\n\nBladder cancer recurrence in the pediatric population is low and 5-year survival rates are favorable at 97.3%. Because of these differences, management differs significantly from adults. There are, however, some similarities between both populations and thus there are some shared aspects to management.\n\nTransurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)\n\nAs with adults, transurethral resection is both diagnostic and therapeutic. This requires resection of all grossly evident tumor, with depth sufficient to obtain sampling of the underlying detrusor muscle. This is necessary to reduce the risk of recurrence but also for adequate staging. TURBTs that require a resectoscope may be prohibitive in small patients as resectoscope loops can be very challenging to work with on smaller scopes. Some children may require cold cup biopsy and fulguration of the tumor base, although care must be taken to obtain deep tissue biopsies for detrusor sampling. Bimanual exam of the bladder should also be performed at time of TURBT to complete staging.\n\nIntravesical therapy\n\nIn general, perioperative chemotherapy instillation is not used for pediatric patients. Pediatric patients who are found to have higher grade and stage tumors are likely to behave more similarly to adult UCC and thus may be best treated as such, although prospective studies of this rare scenario do not exist. These patients may require intravesical chemotherapy and surveillance protocols as those for adults outlined by the AUA and NCCN organizations. There are some reports of post-TURBT use of intravesical instillation BCG, mitomycin, or epirubicin in pediatric patients with bladder cancer. Generally, doses and regimens have been that which is described in adults, with few severe adverse events. Intravesical therapy is typically reserved for patients with high-grade or recurrent disease, but data are limited to case reports, so there are no clear data to establish a well-defined role at this time.\n\nFollow up and Surveillance\n\nAdult guidelines have aggressive, clear, and established regimens for surveillance and management of recurrences as this is commonplace. For children however, there are no clear recommendations due to the rarity of this tumor and the even more rare recurrence. A 2019 review reported just an 8.6% recurrence rate, a significant difference from adults.\n\nGenerally, the type and timing of surveillance should be tailored based on the child’s risk of relapse. The number of lesions, pathologic stage and grade, tumor size, history of recurrence, and age should all be considered. Regular screening with ultrasound is a reasonable option for children with diagnosed bladder cancer due to its high sensitivity and non-invasive nature. Cystoscopy can subsequently be performed if a lesion is detected. Routine surveillance cystoscopy despite normal ultrasounds may be required in higher risk pediatric patients (e.g. multiple lesions, high-grade lesions, recurrence, older age, etc.). Similar to at the time of diagnosis, urine cytology is unlikely to yield much benefit given that children typically have low-grade well-differentiated tumors.\n\nUnlike adult protocols, there are no data to guide the length of surveillance for children with UCC. One large literature review found that if a recurrence or death related to low-grade/stage UCC were to occur, it is likely to occur in the first year of initial diagnosis. The average time to recurrence or death was found to be 8.6 months.\n\nTable 2 Surveillance schedule for low-grade, low-stage bladder UCC in pediatric patients (adapted by Rezaee et al)1\n\n\n  \n    \n       \n      0-12 months\n      18-24 months\n      36-48 months\n      &gt;60 months\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Ultrasound\n      Every 3 mos\n      Every 6 mos\n      Annually\n      At discretion of provider\n    \n    \n      Urinalysis\n      Every 3 mos\n      Every 6 mos\n      Annually\n      At discretion of provider\n    \n    \n      Cystoscopy\n      Every 3 mos\n      Every 6 mos\n      +/- Annually\n      At discretion of provider\n    \n    \n      Cytology\n      —\n      —\n      —\n      —\n    \n  \n\n\nAdditionally, it is very unlikely that a recurrence or death event would occur beyond three years after initial diagnosis and treatment. The most remote recurrence published is at 32 months after initial diagnosis. A potential surveillance schedule for low grade, low stage UCC was outlined by Rezaee et al. based on a 2019 literature review cohort, and this is summarized in (Table 2) It is important to note that this surveillance schedule has not been rigorously studied by a prospective randomized study proving its safety and is outlined as a starting point for low grade/stage disease only.\n\nBladder Tumors in the Neurogenic Bladder Population\n\nLong-term follow up of patients with a congenital neurogenic bladder (i.e. spina bifida, bladder exstrophy, etc.) have identified this population to be uniquely at higher risk for the development of bladder cancer (estimated incidence about 4%). Unlike bladder cancer in the non-neurogenic bladder population, this cohort is usually diagnosed incidentally and has a higher incidence of adenocarcinoma (50%). The vast majority of patients present with locally advanced or widespread disease (&gt;70%) and survival is poor. Diagnosis is often made with late stage disease and outcomes are poor.\n\nInitial postulation for this increased risk of bladder cancer centered around augmentation cystoplasty being a risk factor. While gastric segments certainly increase the subsequent risk of malignancy, augmentation with other bowel segments do not appear to increase the risk of malignancy. Through various retrospective studies, it now appears that the risk of malignancy is due to the congenital bladder itself rather than due to augmentation.\n\nWhen early descriptions of advanced, deadly malignancies in this population were first published, a variety of measures were suggested and then studied with an aim of earlier detection of these tumors. Unfortunately, none have proven beneficial. Annual cystoscopy is of low yield and even in patients with normal screening, advanced bladder cancer did develop. It was suggested that if cystoscopy could detect every malignancy, 980 would need to be performed to diagnose a single case of cancer over 10y of follow up. Urine cytology is of little value in this population due to chronic pyuria, intermittent catheterizations, and expected enteric cell shedding and it also has a high false positive rate. When then including effectiveness of the above screening measures, is appears that the increase in life expectancy was only 2.3 months and lifetime cost was &gt;$55,000 per capita. This is mainly driven by the low rates of malignancy and the large number of screening tests needed to detect a single case of malignancy, independent of stage at diagnosis.\n\nThe Husmann protocol has been widely adopted to guide follow up for patients with neurogenic bladder, both for malignancy detection as well as routine assessment for patients with or without bladder reconstruction (Figure 2) This involves an annual assessment of urinary tract infections, hematuria, bladder/pelvic/flank pain and new incontinence. If there are any abnormalities or changes from baseline, urine culture, cystoscopy, CT scan ± urodynamics should be considered. All patients should have annual creatinine/cystatin C, electrolytes, serum B12 level and urinalysis. Similarly, if there are &lt;50 RBCs/hpf, renal/bladder US should be ordered. If the US is abnormal, if there is gross hematuria or ≥50 RBCs/hpf, then urine culture, cystoscopy, CT scan ± urodynamics should be considered.  For patients with colonic segments, routine cystoscopy for colon cancer screening should begin at age 50y.\n\n\nFigure 2 Husmann protocol for surveillance of bladder cancer in patients with bladder augmentations.2\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Bladder cancer in pediatric patients is rare\n  There are currently no well-defined risk factors for the development of pediatric bladder cancer, but the risk factors from adults are extrapolated and often applied to this population\n  Most pediatric patients with bladder cancer present with painless gross hematuria or irritative voiding symptoms\n  Most pediatric UCC is low-grade, low-stage, and does not recur\n  Initial evaluation should start with history and physical, urinalysis, urine culture, and bladder/renal ultrasound\n  Bladder ultrasound has excellent sensitivity and specificity for detection of bladder tumors and should be considered as a screening modality\n  There is no role for urine cytology as most pediatric UCC is low-grade\n  If a lesion is found on ultrasound, cystoscopy with TURBT should be performed\n  Transurethral resection of bladder tumor should include detrusor sampling for proper staging\n  The role for intravesical chemotherapy is unclear, but is a reasonable consideration for patients with high-stage, high-grade, or recurrent disease\n  Pediatric patients with UCC should undergo surveillance at least for the first 3y after diagnosis, but surveillance beyond this may be unnecessary\n  Patients with a congenital neurogenic bladder (CNB) are at higher risk of bladder cancer and this risk is not associated with bladder augmentation other than gastric segments; pathology is usually adenocarcinoma\n  CNB patients present incidentally with higher stage and locally advanced tumors, with poor survival\n  Routine screening with cystoscopy and urine cytology is not beneficial and is not recommended\n  The Husmann protocol is advocated for follow up for patients with CNB with a goal of targeted identification of patients at higher risk for malignancy (hematuria, increased UTIs, pain, new incontinence, abnormal labs/imaging)\n\n\nConclusion\n\nBladder cancer in pediatric patients is rare and overall carries a good prognosis. Most tumors are solitary, low-grade, and do not recur. Workup should start with history and physical, urinalysis, urine culture, and bladder/renal ultrasound, with subsequent cystoscopy and TURBT of the bladder lesion. Intravesical chemotherapy can often be avoided given low-grade pathology. In high-grade or higher-stage tumors or with recurrent tumors, intravesical chemotherapy can be considered, however, there are no evidence-based guidelines on its use in children presently. Patients should be monitored for a duration of at least 3y with a combination of periodic urinalyses, bladder/renal ultrasounds, and cystoscopy. Surveillance beyond 3y may not be necessary, but shared-decision making should be utilized to determine this duration.\n\nRecommended videos\n\n\n  AUA University, oncology, adult, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, videos 1 and 2\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nKaratzas A, Tzortzis V.

        "title": "Testicular and Paratesticular Tumors in Children",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nTesticular and paratesticular tumours are uncommon in children. They can be primary or secondary, benign or malignant. This chapter gives an overview of the range of lesions clinically encountered in children. Intratesticular lesions are considered, for clinical relevance, in two pediatric age groupings:\n\n\n  The prepubertal child\n  The adolescent and young adult (AYA)\n\n\nIn either of these age groups, testicular tumors have characteristic features to consider, impacting on management and outcome. Testicular sparing surgery (TSS) can be planned for most of the benign prepubertal testicular lesions; whereas most AYA tumors are suspected to be malignant from the outset, and radical orchidectomy is standard surgical care for primary intratesticular or paratesticular malignancy.\n\nEmbryology\n\nThe fetal testis develops from the undifferentiated mesodermal gonad after 6 weeks. In a male fetus, the Müllerian duct regresses in response to AMH secreted by the developing testis. The Wolffian system develops in response to testosterone secreted by the developing testis. Leydig cells producing testosterone arise from the gonadal mesoderm and are found in the interstitium of the mature testis. The mesodermal stromal sex cords develop into seminiferous tubules and supporting epithelial cells give rise to Sertoli cells. The somatic cells of the testis are derived from the mesoderm of the gonadal ridge, but the primordial germ cells originate from the epiblast/yolk sac after around 8 days of embryonal development, and migrate to the gonadal ridge, settling in close proximity to the gonadal mesoderm.1\n\nThis derivation of cells from different embryological origins within the developing testis underlies the myriad of possible tumors, with differing behaviours, that may present in the pediatric testis.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nTesticular tumors in children account for 1-2% of all solid pediatric tumors.2 The incidence is estimated at 0.5-2 per 100,000 children.3 In the pediatric age group, there is a peak incidence in adolescence, with a smaller peak under 3 years of age.4\n\nIt is now very clear that most intra-testicular tumors in prepubertal children are benign. 60-70% of prepubertal intratesticular tumors are reported to be benign.5,6 75% of intratesticular tumors in post-pubertal AYA are malignant.7 The commonest benign tumor in the prepubertal age group is teratoma, presenting at a median age of 13 months.8 Yolk-sac tumours are the commonest malignant testicular tumor in the prepubertal age group, with a median age of presentation around 16 months.9 These two germ cell origin tumors form a big proportion of the early under-age-3 peak in incidence of testicular tumors.\n\nThe commonest testicular malignancy in the AYA group is mixed germ cell tumors.10 Pure seminoma is rare in AYA. Unlike prepubertal children, who predominantly get pure yolk cell tumors, the germ cell tumors in AYA are non-seminomatous and generally of mixed histology, including embryonal carcinoma as the most common histological subtype.10 Teratoma presenting in AYA is usually malignant, unlike in prepubertal children.7\n\nPathogenesis and Overview of Testicular and Paratesticular Tumor Types in Children\n\nPrimary testicular tumors can arise from germ cells (Germ cell tumors, GCTs) or stromal cells (Sex cord/Stromal cell tumors) of the testis. GCTs are far more common than stromal tumors .\n\nGCTs are classified as per the World Health Organisation 2016 classification - either Germ cell neoplasia in situ derived (GCNIS-derived), which are mostly postpubertal in presentation; or not Germ cell neoplasia in situ derived (not GCNIS-derived), which mostly present in the prepubertal period.11\n\nThe not GCNIS-derived group of GCTs includes prepubertal yolk-sac tumors, prepubertal type teratoma including dermoid and epidermoid cysts, and spermatocytic tumour (which occurs mainly in adults). Carcinoma in situ or intratubular germ cell neoplasia is almost non-existent in the pre-pubertal age group, unlike in AYA and older adults.12,13\n\nThe GCNIS-derived group of GCTs includes postpubertal-type teratoma, yolk sac tumor, embryonal carcinoma, trophoblastic tumors including choriocarcinoma, all of which can present in the AYA group; and seminoma, which is more common in older adults.\n\nSex cord and stromal testicular tumors are rare in children. Leydig cell tumors are almost always benign in prepubertal children.14,15 Juvenile granulosa cell tumors are usually benign in the prepubertal group.16 Sertoli cell tumors are mostly benign but can be malignant in around 10%, especially in older children.17 Sertoli cell tumors may be associated with syndromes such as Carney Syndrome and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.\n\nGonadoblastoma is a unique malignancy of the gonad in childhood. Gonadoblastoma cells encompass both stromal and germ cells of the gonad. Gonadoblastoma almost always presents in the context of differences or variances of sex development.18\n\nRare developmental anomalies of the testis such rete dysplasia of the testis can present as a mass of the prepubertal testis. Rete dysplasia is almost always associated with ipsilateral renal agenesis.19 Simple testicular cysts and epididymal cysts can also present in childhood as testicular or scrotal masses.\n\nParatesticular tumors in childhood can be benign or malignant. Benign paratesticular tumors are rare include lesions such as hemangioma, leiomyoma and lipoma.2 Malignant paratesticular tumors include rhabdomysarcoma, which is the commonest paratesticular malignancy in children.2 and the rare melanotic neuroectodermal tumour of infancy, which is mostly benign, but can exhibit malignant behaviour.20\n\nIt must be remembered that the testis in childhood is a common location for metastatic or infiltrative malignancy, such as metastatic leukemia or lymphoma.7\n\nWhilst cryptorchidism is a known risk factor for testicular malignancy, majority of reported childhood testicular tumors are not associated with cryptorchidism. Cryptorchidism is associated with an increased risk of post-pubertal malignancy, bilaterally, by 2-5 times that of the general population.21 This risk appears to be reduced by orchidopexy early in childhood.22 Malignancy type occurring most commonly in uncorrected or late-operated cryptorchidism is seminoma.23\n\nTesticular microlithiasis, usually incidentally detected on ultrasound scan in children, has not been shown to be associated with an increased risk of childhood testicular tumors . Testicular microlithiasis may be associated with an increased risk of testicular malignancy in adult life, especially if associated with other risk factors such as cryptorchidism. Postpubertal testicular self examination is thus advised to facilitate early detection.24\n\nEvaluation and diagnosis\n\nThe commonest mode of presentation of testicular or paratesticular tumor is a painless scrotal mass, noted by the child or carer. Sometimes, a reactive hydrocele may be present. Scrotal swelling may herald review and investigation, and occasionally the mass may be detected incidentally after presentation with trauma, or on ultrasound scan (USS). There may be few other discerning clinical characteristics noted if a scrotal lump is palpated. However, Leydig cell tumors may be associated with signs of precocious puberty, and 10% of Sertoli cell tumors may also present with signs of precocious puberty.25\n\nUSS of the scrotum and testis is a very useful initial investigation. It usually provides a clear indication of location and size of mass, whether solid or cystic, whether diffuse or well defined, whether intratesticular or paratesticular, its vascularity and whether uni or multifocal. Some prepubertal lesions have characteristic features on USS, such as the ‘onion peel’ layers of an epidermal cyst (Figure 1), lobulated appearance of dermoid cyst (Figure 2), and characteristic cystic appearance of rete dysplasia of the testis (Figure 3).26 Teratomas may have a variegated cystic/solid appearance (Figure 4). Benign lesions tend to display low vascularity on USS. Malignant lesions are usually hypoechoic, solid and homogenous on USS.\n\n\nFigure 1 Ultrasound of Testicular epidermoid cyst, onion peel appearance (Arrow)\n\n\nFigure 2 Ultrasound of Testicular dermoid cyst, lobulated cyst filled with debris\n\n\nFigure 3 Ultrasound of Cystic dysplasia rete testis, testis on left and cystic dysplasia on right of image\n\n\nFigure 4 Ultrasound of Prepubertal testicular teratoma, variegated appearance\n\nSerum tumor markers may be helpful in discerning benign from malignant lesions. For testicular tumours, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (BHCG) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are the most commonly used markers. BHCG is usually not useful in prepubertal tumor evaluation as choriocarcinoma and embryonal carcinoma, which may secrete BHCG, are almost never noted in this age group.7,27 However, BHCG is very important in the post-pubertal AYA group, where these lesions can occur. AFP is the most important marker in the prepubertal age group, as it is markedly raised in almost all yolk cell tumors, commonly seen in this age group.9 Teratoma may have a mildly elevated AFP, but AFP levels over 100ng/mL have not been reported in prepubertal teratoma.9 This marked difference in AFP levels between benign teratoma and malignant yolk cell tumor also helps in planning for TSS versus radical orchidectomy. It should be noted whilst interpreting AFP levels, that infants up to 8 months of age may have naturally high serum AFP levels.28\n\nClinical characteristics, imaging characteristics of the lesion, and serum tumor marker levels will help guide further management. If the lesion is suspected to be malignant, staging abdominal pelvic and chest CT to assess for locoregional spread and metastases would be important. 20% of prepubertal yolk cell tumors have lung metastases at presentation.29\n\nA lesion with clinical and USS characteristics of a benign tumor, and with no elevation in tumor marker serum levels, does not usually require staging CT prior to resection.\n\nSummary of Testicular Tumors in Prepubertal Children\n\nTable 1 Testicular and Paratesticular Tumors in Childhood\n\n\n  \n    \n      Classification\n      Type\n      Subtype\n      Benign\n      Mostly benign, may be malignant\n      Malignant\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Primary Testicular/Gonadal tumors\n      Prepubertal Testicular Tumors\n      GCT - not GCNIS derived\n      Prepubertal Teratoma\n       \n      Yolk sac tumor\n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n      Epidermoid cyst\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n      Dermoid cyst\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n      Sex Cord / Stromal Tumors\n      Juvenile granulosa cell tumor\n      Leydig cell tumor\n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       Sertoli cell tumor\n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n      Developmental Anomalies and Simple Cysts\n      Cystic Dyplasia  Rete Testis\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n      Testicular cyst\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n      Epididymal cyst\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n      Testicular Tumors in Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA)\n      GCT - GCNIS derived\n       \n       \n      Postpubertal Teratoma\n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n      Embryonal carcinoma\n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n      Yolk cell tumor\n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n      Choriocarcinoma\n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n      Mixed GCTs\n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n      Seminoma\n    \n    \n       \n      Gonadal tumor in Differences of Sex Development (DSD)\n       \n       \n       \n      Gonadoblastoma\n    \n    \n      Secondary Testicular metastases/infiltration\n       \n       \n       \n       \n      Leukemia e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n      Lymphoma e.g., Burkitts Lymphoma\n    \n    \n      Paratesticular Tumors\n       \n       \n      Hemangioma\n      Melanotic Neuroectodermal Tumor of Infancy\n      Paratesticular Rhabdomyosarcoma\n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n      Leiomyoma\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n      Lipoma\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nGCT=Germ cell tumor, GCNIS=Germ cell neoplasia in situ\n\nPrimary Testicular/ Gonadal Tumors\n\nTesticular Benign GCTs (not GCNIS derived)\n\nTeratoma\n\nThese are almost always benign when presenting prepubertally.8 Median age of presentation is 13 months.2 They often have a heterogenous appearance on USS (Figure 4) because teratomas can have elements from any or all of the three embryonal germ cell layers - endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. Teratomas usually contain mature elements in this age group, with immature elements occasionally reported. Even with immature elements, outcome after TSS is usually good in this age group.30 TSS is usually feasible for prepubertal teratoma, and after successful excision and histological confirmation of benign nature, usually no further follow up is required.27\n\nEpidermoid cyst\n\nThese are benign cysts of ectodermal origin, lined by epithelium that produces keratin. The cyst has a characteristic layered ‘onion-peel’ appearance on USS (Figure 1).11 They are easily enucleated, so TSS is standard of care. Routine long-term surveillance is not required post-excision, but rare recurrence is reported.26\n\nDermoid cyst\n\nDermoid cysts comprise cutaneous-type elements, including appendages such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands. They are benign. USS appearances often show thick walled, smooth contoured cystic lesions with avascular echogenic debris (Figure 2).31,32 TSS is standard of care, and routine surveillance post excision is not usually required.27\n\nTesticular Malignant GCTs (not GCNIS derived)\n\nYolk cell tumor\n\nThis is the commonest intratesticular malignancy in the prepubertal child.The usual age of presentation is in the early peak under age 3, at median 16 months of age.9 The tumors are usually solid and homogenous usually on USS. Serum AFP is markedly elevated. 80% of prepubertal yolk cell tumors are stage 1 at presentation.33 20% have lung metastases at presentation.2 If a yolk sac tumor is suspected, staging CT chest, abdomen and pelvis should be performed, and radical orchidectomy planned. Radical lymph node dissection (RLND) is not routinely performed for prepubertal yolk cell tumor, as hematogenous spread without locoregional spread is common in yolk cell tumor; which RLND, with its significant risk of morbidity, will not address.34\n\nFor confirmed Stage 1 disease, with normalisation of serum AFP post surgery, chemotherapy is usually not required. Recurrence rates are around 20% . Regular post-surgical oncological surveillance with AFP level screening plus imaging such as MRI is thus advised, and salvage rates after treatment of recurrence are excellent.2,35 For clinical stage 2 disease with lymph node involvement, and metatstatic disease, chemotherapy is indicated in most protocols. Platinum-based chemotherapy is highly effective for yolk sac tumor. RLND is reserved for locoregional residual or recurrent disease.2,33\n\nTesticular Sex Cord and Stromal tumors\n\nJuvenile Granulosa cell tumors\n\nThese usually benign tumors usually occur in infants, and are the most common neonatal testicular tumors. Histologically, they are comprised of sheets of granulosa like cells, often with cystic change.16,36 TSS is usually successful and curative, recurrences have not been reported, and long-term surveillance after excision is not usually required.27\n\nLeydig cell tumors\n\nIn children Leydig cell tumors are usually benign, although they can be malignant in adults. Leydig cell tumors usually present in children of around 5-10 years of age.14,15 Most present as a painless testicular mass. However, Leydig cell tumors can present with precocious puberty due to testosterone production . In addition, 10-15% of children with Leydig cell tumors can have signs of feminisation such as gynaecomastia due to estradiol secretion.2 The intraoperative appearance of Leydig cell tumors is of yellow homogenous nodules. In prepubertal children, TSS is recommended as Leydig cell tumors are almost always benign in this age group. If precocious puberty is an associated feature, then endocrinology review and follow up is advised. Pubertal changes do not reverse after the tumor is excised, as the pubertal hormonal axis has been activated.2\n\nSertoli cell tumors\n\nThese present at a young median age of 6 months, although they can occur at any prepubertal age. A third are associated with syndromes such as Peutz-Jeghers or Carney syndrome. 10% present with changes of precocious puberty because they are hormonally active; or even gynaecomastia, due to tumor secretion of aromatase, resulting in conversion of androstenedione to estrone.37 They are mostly benign, but can be malignant in older children. Hence, pre-operative staging CT would be prudent, especially in children over age 5 years. Current guidelines recommend considering TSS for Sertoli cell tumors in children.27\n\nDevelopmental anomalies and cysts\n\nCystic dysplasia of the rete testis is a rare developmental anomaly that presents as a testicular lump. It is almost always associated with ipsilateral renal agenesis. USS shows the lesion to be cystic, usually at the upper pole of testis, with compression of adjacent normal testicular tissue (Figure 3). Traditionally TSS for the lesion was recommended. Significant rates of recurrence after TSS have been reported. With the characteristic appearance on ultrasound and associated ipsilateral renal anomaly, its benign nature, and increasing reports of regression of the lesion over time, conservative testicular-sparing management with surveillance is now being suggested. A biopsy of the lesion, if there is any doubt about the diagnosis prior to conservative management, may be considered.38,39\n\nSimple epididymal cysts and intratesticular cysts may occur in childhood. Occasionally they are symptomatic. They are usually amenable to enucleation or deroofing if required.\n\nSummary of Testicular Tumors in AYA\n\nTesticular tumors in AYA are usually malignant, and usually GCTs, mainly GCNIS-derived. Testicular GCTs comprise 14% of adolescent malignancies, and are the commonest solid tumor in this age bracket .\n\nHistologically, they mostly tend to be embryonal carcinomas, with mixed non-seminomatous GCT components. They often present with metastatic disease and have a higher rate of relapse. Assessment of suspected malignancies includes imaging with USS, tumour markers - AFP, BHCG and LDH, and staging CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.10 Postpubertal teratoma is also GCNIS derived unlike its prepubertal counterpart. Metastases occur in 22-37% of AYA teratoma.40 It should also be noted that malignant testicular tumours in AYA may not necessarily have elevated tumor markers.41\n\nStandard of care for a suspected testicular malignancy in AYA is radical orchidectomy by inguinal approach. For localised disease, radical orchidectomy is usually curative. AYAs who have clinical stage 1 disease after orchidectomy, usually undergo active surveillance for detection of recurrence; 20-30% will have clinical recurrence, and survival with salvage chemotherapy is excellent.10 This conservative approach limits over-treatment of majority with clinical stage 1 disease, and limits exposure to platinum based chemotherapy side effects, by targeting the treatment to those who have demonstrable recurrent disease. Tumors &gt;4cm, lymphovascular invasion, and an increasing component of embryonal carcinoma are associated with a higher risk of metastatic disease.42\n\nAYAs with clinical stage II and III disease usually receive chemotherapy. RLND is selectively used for those with residual disease or mass post chemotherapy, despite tumor markers being negative, as the residual lesion may be teratoma, usually less responsive to chemotherapy.10\n\nSummary of Paratesticular Tumors in Children\n\nTSS with focal excision of the lesion is usually considered for rare benign paratesticular lesions such as lipoma.\n\nMelanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare tumor affecting the epididymal and paratesticular region.20 It is usually benign, but histologically differentiating it from round blue cell malignancies on biopsy can be a challenge. Typically benign, orchidectomy is usually curative; but 10% can display malignant behaviour with recurrence and/or metastases. After surgery, follow up surveillance with cross sectional imaging such as MRI is advised.2\n\nParatesticular rhabdomyosarcoma is the most commonly encountered paratesticular malignancy in childhood. It comprises 5% of all intrascrotal malignancies, and 40% of all paratesticular malignancies.43 There is a bimodal peak in incidence, one in the AYA group and one in infants under 6 months of age. The tumor originates from the mesenchymal elements of paratesticular tissues. Presentation is usually with a painless scrotal mass, and a significant proportion have metastatic disease at presentation. USS usually shows a solid paratesticular lesion (Figure 5). Staging abdominal, pelvis and chest CT is required to assess for locoregional and metastatic spread. Tumour markers are usually negative.\n\n\nFigure 5 Ultrasound of Paratesticular Rhabdomyosarcoma, normal testis on left of image, large paratesticular mass on right of image\n\nA consensus statement from the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the European paediatric Soft tissue sarcoma Study Group (EpSSG) and the Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) about surgical management of paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma has been recently published.44 Radical orchidectomy with en-bloc resection of the tumor, testis and cord to the internal ring, is current recommended surgical management of paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma. Scrotal approach for resection is contraindicated as it makes proximal clearance at the level of the internal ring difficult; trans-scrotal biopsy should also be avoided as it increases risk of tumor spill.\n\nMost paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood are histologically embryonal. If the lesion is embryonal, then for children over age 10 years, retroperitoneal lymph node evaluation is advised for any clinical stage; but for boys under age 10 years, retroperitoneal lymph node evaluation is performed only if there is evidence of local spread or enlarged nodes. If there are enlarged nodes on imaging and no lymph node evaluation is done, recommendation is to treat with chemotherapy as though nodes are involved.44\n\nFor histologically alvaeolar rhabdomyosarcoma, retroperitoneal lymph node evaluation is recommended for all patients regardless of imaging findings. If lymph nodes are positive, then chemotherapy and radiotherapy are indicated.44\n\nOutcomes after paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma treatment are better for the prepubertal group than AYA group. There is a 90% failure-free survival in the prepubertal age group versus 63% in adolescents.45\n\nMetastases or Infiltrative Malignancy in Testes in Childhood\n\nTestes are a common site of infiltration in leukemia and lymphoma - such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, follicular lymphoma or Burkitt’s lymphoma in children. Presentation is usually with a significantly enlarged testis unilaterally or bilaterally. Ultrasound scan findings often delineate a diffusely hypoechoic enlarged testis with hypervascularity.46\n\nTSS and Radical Orchidectomy\n\nClinical guidelines now strongly recommend TSS for prepubertal testicular tumors that are strongly suspected to be benign on work-up.27 TSS is performed by inguinal approach. Atraumatic vessel clamping of the spermatic cord prior to testicular mobilisation and dissection is considered a standard oncological technique, and allows to minimise bleeding and optimise visualisation of the dissection in the usually small prepubertal organ. (Figure 6).\n\n\nFigure 6 TSS - Atraumatic vascular clamp on cord, Leydig cell tumor at lower pole testis\n\nFrozen section assessment is useful to help confirm that the lesion is benign and that margins are clear. In many experienced centres, frozen section is not routinely performed now for prepubertal tumor-marker-negative lesions with benign clinical and ultrasound characteristics.41 If there is doubt or suspicion of malignancy despite the steps of TSS, then TSS is abandoned and radical orchidectomy is performed. If TSS is successfully performed, the tunica albuginea is sutured closed after lesion resection, and the testis replaced in the scrotum.\n\nIn all children with clinically suspected testicular and paratesticular malignancy, preoperative staging for locoregional and metastatic spread should be performed. Standard of care for malignant lesions is radical orchidectomy, performed via inguinal approach and with vascular clamping prior to mobilisation of the testis and lesion. The cord should be ligated and resected at the level of the internal ring. For paratesticular lesions, the tumor should be resected en-bloc with the testis and cord; if there is scrotal skin invasion, then the affected scrotal skin should be resected en-bloc with the lesion as well.44\n\nClinical Staging for Malignant Tumors\n\nThe Children’s Oncology Group (COG) use a Stage I-IV clinical staging system for prepubertal testicular malignancies (Table 2). Stage I is essentially disease localised to the testis at time of resection.\n\nTable 2 Children’s Oncology Group Staging for Testicular Tumors\n\n\n  \n    \n      Stage\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      I\n      Limited to testis, completely resected by high inguinal orchidectomy; no clinical, radiographic, or histologic evidence of disease beyond the testes\n    \n    \n       \n      Patients with normal or unknown tumor markers at diagnosis must have a negative ipsilateral RPLND to confirm stage I disease if imaging demonstrates LNs &gt;2 cm\n    \n    \n       \n      Patients who have undergone scrotal orchidectomy with high ligation of cord are stage I”\n    \n    \n      II\n      “Trans-scrotal biopsy; microscopic disease in scrotum or high in spermatic cord (&lt;5 cm from proximal end)\n    \n    \n       \n      Failure of tumor markers to normalize or decrease with an appropriate half-life”\n    \n    \n      III\n      Trans-scrotal biopsy; microscopic disease in scrotum or high in spermatic cord (&lt;5 cm from proximal end)\n    \n    \n       \n      LNs &gt;4 cm by CT or 2–4 cm with biopsy proof”\n    \n    \n      IV\n      Distant metastases, including liver\n    \n    \n      III\n      Retroperitoneal LN involvement, but no visceral or extra-abdominal involvement\n    \n  \n\n\nThe American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) generally uses the Tumor (T), Nodes (N) and Metastases (M) system with an S delineation for post surgical tumor markers (Table 3)\n\nTable 3 AJCC Staging\n\n\n  \n    \n      T-Primary Tumor\n      N-Regional LNs\n      M-Distant Metastasis\n      S-Serum Tumor Markers\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      pT0 – no evidence of primary tumor\n      cN0 – no regional LN metastasis\n      M0 – no distant metastasis\n      S0 – marker levels within normal limits\n    \n    \n      pTis – intratubular germ cell neoplasia (carcinoma in-situ)\n      pN0 – no regional LN metastasis\n      M1 – distant metastasis\n      S1 - LDH &lt; 1.5 X N and hCG (mIU/mL) &lt;5000 and AFP (ng/mL) &lt;1000\n    \n    \n      pT1 – tumor limited to the testis and epididymis without LVI; tumor may invade into the tunica albuginea but not the tunica vaginalis\n      cN1 – metastasis with an LN mass≤ 2 cm or multiple LNs, none&gt;2 cm\n      M1a – nonregional nodal or pulmonary metastasis\n      S2 LDH 1.5–10 X N or hCG (mIU/mL) 5000–50,000 or AFP (ng/mL) 1000–10,000\n    \n    \n      pT2 – tumor limited to the testis and epididymis with LVI, or tumor extending through the tunica albuginea with involvement of the tunica vaginalis\n      pN1 – metastasis with an LN mass≤2 cm and ≤5 nodes positive, none &gt;2 cm\n      M1b – distant metastasis other than to nonregional LNs and lung\n      S3 LDH &gt;10 x N or hCG (mIU/mL) &gt;50,000 or AFP (ng/mL) &gt;10,000\n    \n    \n      pT3 – tumor invades the spermatic cord with or without LVI\n      cN2 – metastasis with an LN mass 2–5 cm or multiple LNs, any one&gt;2 cm but not &gt;5 cm\n       \n       \n    \n    \n      pT4 –tumor invades the scrotum with or without LVI\n      pN2 – metastasis with an LN mass 2–5 cm, or &gt;5 nodes positive, none &gt;5 cm, or evidence of extranodal tumor extension\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n      cN3 – metastasis with an LN mass &gt;5 cm\n       \n       \n    \n    \n       \n      pN3 – metastasis with an LN mass&gt;5 cm\n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nAFP: alpha fetoprotein; hCG : beta human chorionic gonadotropin; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LN: lymph node; LVI: lymphovascular invasion; N: normal; c: clinical; p: pathologic; T: primary tumor; N: regional lymph nodes; M: metastasis; S: serum tumor markers.\n\nThe now superseded Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies (IRS) established both a ‘grouping’ system based on surgical resectability, and an IRS- modified TNM Staging system for paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\nComplications of Treatment\n\nBoth TSS and radical orchidectomy are procedures associated with good recovery, with small associated risks of bleeding with scrotal haematoma, infection and lesion recurrence. Testicular atrophy is rare after TSS.41\n\nIn recent years, focus of managing pediatric testicular and paratesticular tumors has been on reducing the risks and long term negative effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, by stratifying tumour risk, and only offering further treatment to children who meet the required criteria. Most children with stage I disease will be offered active surveillance after tumor resection now, and only those with demonstrated recurrent disease will require chemotherapy.\n\nChemotherapy side effects such as cisplatin nephrotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy, and lung fibrosis after Bleomycin, are well reported.\n\nLong term negative effects of chemo and radiotherapy include fertility impairment and secondary malignancies.\n\nSuggested Follow Up and Surveillance After Treatment\n\nConfirmed benign lesions with clear margins such as prepubertal teratoma do not generally require routine long term surveillance after TSS. However, clinical guidelines suggest initial post surgical follow up with ultrasound scan 3-6 monthly for the first post-operative year.27\n\nAll children with testicular and paratesticular malignancy require appropriate follow up and surveillance for a few years as per oncological protocols. This is to maintain active surveillance for recurrent disease, and to monitor for long term effects after surgery and treatment with chemotherapy and /or radiotherapy.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Majority of prepubertal testicular tumors are benign\n  Majority of malignant prepubertal testicular tumors are pure yolk cell tumors\n  Sex cord / Stromal testicular tumors are rare in childhood and largely tend to be benign\n  Majority of testicular tumors in AYA are malignant\n  Paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma is the commonest paratesticular malignancy in children, but remains rare\n\n\nConclusions\n\nMajority of prepubertal testicular tumors are benign. TSS is safe to consider and recommended for prepubertal testicular tumours with clinical and USS characteristics of a benign lesion, and negative tumor markers.\n\nMajority of malignant prepubertal testicular tumors are pure yolk cell tumors. AFP is markedly elevated in most yolk cell tumors. After staging CT work-up, treatment is by radical orchidectomy. Most have Stage I disease localised to the testis and surgery is curative. Chemotherapy is reserved for children with disease Stage II or higher, or for those with Stage I who have recurrence after surgery.\n\nMajority of testicular tumors in AYA are malignant. They tend to be embryonal carcinomas and mixed germ cell tumors.\n\nSex cord / Stromal testicular tumors are rare in childhood and largely tend to be benign and amenable to TSS.\n\nParatesticular rhabdomyosarcoma is the commonest paratesticular malignancy in children. After appropriate staging and work-up, treatment is usually radical orchidectomy en-bloc with the paratesticular tumor mass, by inguinal approach. If the lesion is embryonal on histology, retroperitoneal lymph node evaluation is recommended for children older than age 10 years, regardless of stage; and for boys under 10 years old who have evidence of locoregional disease or nodal recurrence. If the lesion is alveolar on histology, retroperitoneal lymph node evaluation is recommended for all regardless of imaging findings.\n\nReferences\n\n\nSilber S.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nPediatric cancer is defined as a rare disease, representing less than 1 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States. Nevertheless, is a leading cause of death for children and adolescents.1 Over the past four decades, there has been a continuous, increase in the incidence of cancers occurring under the age of 15.2\n\nThe likelihood of surviving a diagnosis of childhood cancer depends on the country in which the child lives: in high-income countries, more than 80% of children with cancer are cured, but in many low-income countries less than 30% are cured.3 A high proportion of survivors of cancer, represents individuals at high risk of experiencing serious, disabling, and life-threatening acute, chronic, and late adverse effects of cancer and its therapy.4\n\nCancers that occur among those aged 0–17 reflect a heterogeneous group of diseases with unique biologic, genetic, and demographic features. Moreover, the classification and categorization of childhood cancers are continually evolving with the emergence of new knowledge relating to the molecular, pathologic, and prognostic characteristics of this diverse group of malignancies. Leukemias, lymphomas, and central nervous system cancers combined account for 70 percent of cancer cases in this age range.1\n\nMultidisciplinary Care—What is Old is New Again\n\nIn order to effectively treat cancer in children, numerous different medical and healthcare professions are frequently required, risking poor communication and ineffective care coordination. These professionals involved in a patient's cancer care make up the oncology team, known as multidisciplinary team (MDT), defined as an integrated approach to health care in which medical and allied health care professionals jointly develop an individual treatment plan for each patient, taking into account all appropriate treatment options.\n\nIn cancer, the idea of a MDT is not new. In the past 50 years, tumor boards have existed in the United States. Yet, up until recently, enhancing patient care was less of a priority than education. A trend toward community-based cancer care in the United States throughout the 1980s sparked the creation of tumor boards, which facilitated information sharing among participating physicians and improved the standard of care.5\n\nIn many healthcare systems, multidisciplinary cancer care is still referred to as tumor boards, multidisciplinary cancer conferences, multidisciplinary case reviews, or multidisciplinary clinics. According to the population they serve, these MDTs and clinics generally focus on specific organs or tumors. These meetings are often held weekly at large hospitals; but, in smaller facilities, they may be held monthly or connected through videoconferencing to larger cancer centers for ongoing meetings.\n\nRegular meetings have been endorsed as a means to achieve this, to ensure that all patients receive prompt diagnosis and treatment, that patient management is evidence-based, and that there is continuity of care. In Chile, a National Cancer Plan was published in 1988 and endorsed the multidisciplinary team model for the management of cancer patients.\n\nMDT has been recognized as a crucial facilitator in the delivery of high-quality care and treatment for cancer patients. The focus of MDT meetings is on collaborative decision-making and treatment planning, where core team members from pertinent specialties attend the meetings to share their expertise and formulate group recommendations for patient management that are supported by the best available scientific evidence.\n\nStudies in adult population has demonstrated that MDT choices improve adherence to evidence-based recommendations and lead to changes of cancer diagnosis and treatment regimens in new cancer cases.6 Furthermore, excellent patient satisfaction with the use of MDTs has been demonstrated.7\n\nEvidence to Support the Role of Mdt\n\nAlthough the evidence linking MDT approach to enhanced survival has not been clearly established, recent data seem to support the association between it and improved pediatric liver cancer survival in our country. Physicians in training have a great opportunity to discuss specific situations at meetings. Health-members communicate and share information, especially between hospital-based specialists and primary care doctors, to improve referral and ongoing care.\n\nMedical oncologists, orthopedic oncologists, pediatric oncologists, head and neck surgeons, diagnostic and interventional radiologists, radiotherapists, pathologists, and nurses are typically the core components of the multidisciplinary cancer team.\n\nOther members involved in the MDT are: 1. Palliative care physicians and nurses, currently referred to as supportive care team, their role is to prevent and treat symptoms and side effects of cancer and its treatment. 2. Oncology clinical pharmacist, experts in drug protocols, drug administration, dosage adjustment, interactions, and adverse effects. 3. Mental health professionals, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, and certified counselors. 4. Rehabilitation therapist, such as physical, occupational, speech, or recreational therapists. 5. Oncology social worker, connecting people with financial support resources and other practical resources. 6. Genetic counsellors a crucial component of modern cancer treatment planning, and family's cancer risk.\n\nDepending on the tumor stream and the health service, the team's composition differs. In our country, the pediatric oncologist attends the conference with patient information and concerns. In US and European countries, this role relies in Nurse Practitioners or Physician assistants.\n\nIn accordance with the stage of cancer management, all healthcare professionals present their points of view, discussions are held, and recommendations are stated and documented in the patient's medical records. An appropriate member of the care team follows up on all recommendations with the patient's parents once the meeting is over.\n\nWhen implementing MDT work, a number of significant obstacles could arise, including a lack of time, staff resources, and small caseloads. Issues with hierarchical structures and unequal involvement in decision-making should also be addressed. To prevent marginalization of team members and bad decision-making, effective meetings should be complemented by effective leadership. The team must come to an agreement of mutual respect for one other's beliefs, valuing different opinions and the encouragement of constructive discussion, representing the patient's views and psychological aspects of care.\n\nAlthough the necessity of inter-professional contact is universally acknowledged, there are differing opinions regarding the relative benefits of formal multidisciplinary meetings vs unofficial gatherings of practitioners when the need arises.\n\nThere is scarce information in the literature about the impact in survival of MDT meetings, and although, they are already widely accepted as the norm in many healthcare systems, making unlikely to have randomized control studies about it, some clinicians have expressed concern about the negative effects these meetings may have on trainees who attend these meetings in a purely passive capacity.8 Concerns are also expressed over the patients' diminishing role in these meetings and the possibility that their preferences and viewpoints may not be completely represented, without giving patients the chance to fully consider all of their available options.\n\nRole for Clinical Decision Support Systems\n\nIs there a role for clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in pediatric oncology care? CDSS can be defined as ‘‘systems that are designed to be a direct aid to clinical decision-making in which the characteristics of an individual patient are matched to a computerized clinical knowledge base, and patient-specific assessments or recommendations are then presented to the clinician(s) and/or the patient for a decision’’.9\n\nElectronic medical records (EMRs), could help cancer MDT with organizational and administrative issues like planning, data gathering, presentation, and uniform documentation of decisions. Yet, using a CDSS, supports patient-centered, evidence-based decision-making, assessing all patient data in real time, including comorbidities, and provide alerts, reminders, and management recommendations, producing patient-specific real time recommendations.10\n\nIt is important to emphasize that CDSS typically just recommend the best management plan, outlining the medical reasoning and pertinent supporting documents and research; the MDT members are, of course, ultimately responsible for making the decision.\n\nMoreover, the CDSS allows health caregivers and student doctors to process cases, and they can compare their own conclusions to the suggestions and supporting data.\n\nAlso, a CDS system's patient-friendly module can give patients access to and explanations of clinical recommendations in the proper manner, assisting them in understanding the rationale behind therapies being recommended and enabling them make better-informed decisions.\n\nConclusions\n\nAs conclusion, cancer care has come a long way, from a one-medical doctor decision-making, to forums where interesting cases where presented, to MDT meetings for collaborative day-to-day management of cancer patients.\n\nNew research should be directed to investigate better methods to support these heavily loaded but key care planning meetings. An advanced decision-support-technology promise for a transparent operational system supporting the decision making of MDTs worldwide.11\n\nReferences\n\n\nSteliarova-Foucher E, Colombet M, Ries LAG, Hesseling P, Moreno F, Shin HY.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe overall probability of forming stones differs in various parts of the world and is estimated as 1–5% in Asia, 10–15% in United States and ranges from 1–15% worldwide depending on age, gender, race, and geographic location.1 In the last few decades, there is an increase in the prevalence of kidney stones all over the world. In USA, in adults the prevalence estimate for the period of 2007–2010 was 8.8%. This increase in the stone disease has also been reported among the young people, with girls being more affected by the stone disease as compared to boys.2,3,4 The increase in the incidence of stone disease causes an increase in emergency visits, hospitalisations, surgeries and health care costs. In USA, the health care costs for pediatric urolithiasis amounted to at least 375 million dollars annually.5 Also, the recurrence rates of stones are around 50 % in children within 3 to 5 years of initial episode of development of stone.6,7,8 However, upto 60% children present with stones which are not amenable to spontaneous passage and surgical treatment remains the mainstay of treatment in such individuals.9 However, the surgical treatment has undergone a paradigm shift in the last few decades. There has been a transition from open surgery to ESWL to endourology for pediatric renal stones in last 50 years. Up to 1980s, majority of the renal stones were treated by open surgical methods. However, with the introduction of ESWL and PCNL after 1980s, firstly in the adults, their safety and efficacy were established in the pediatric population too. Currently, with the miniaturization of instruments, endourological management in the form of PCNL and RIRS has vastly improved the access to the pelvicalyceal system of pediatric patients with stones with minimum complications and maximum stone clearance rates.10\n\nExtracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy\n\nExtracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (ESWL) was first used to treat renal stones in adults in early 1980s. After the safety was established in adults, it was soon used in pediatric population by 1986.11,12 Initially, the manufacturers recommended the treatment for patients only with a height greater than 135 cms because of technical challenges for the machines. ESWL is one of the treatment options for treating renal stones up to size 15 mm. For stone size more than 15 mm, the retreatment rates increase substantially and stone clearance rates also decrease in comparison to endourological treatments.\n\nWith the improvement in lithotripters with removal of water bath and US guided stone imaging, the acceptance and treatment with ESWL in children increased gradually. Stone free rates are between 65% to 71% in pediatric patients depending upon the location of stone, energy given and machine used.13\n\nAdvantages of ESWL\n\nThe most important advantage which ESWL provides is that it is a non-invasive procedure. Also, the stone free rates of around 68% to 84% are achieved with a single or a double sitting. This can be attributed to the fact that there is less attenuation of the shock waves, and the shockwaves are better propagated through the small body volume of the child resulting in better fragmentation. Also, the ureters of the children are more accommodative than that of the adults. So, the ureters of children can pass stones more easily than adult population.\n\nDisadvantages of ESWL\n\nThe most important drawback is low stone clearance rates in comparison to endourological procedures. Secondly, even ESWL requires general anesthesia in vast majority of pediatric patients (Figure 1). Thirdly, there are concerns regarding effects of ESWL on the growing and developing kidney. Lifshitz et al studied effects of ESWL on 29 for a mean of 9 years, and found that there was a trend towards reduced renal growth in the treated kidneys with one case of hypertension..14 However, the authors believed that the changes were due to abnormal kidneys and changes were not attributable to ESWL. Further follow up of 39 children treated with ESWL had no hypertension or renal scarring on DMSA scan, after a range of 6 months to 8 years.15 Villanyi et al examined in 16 children between the ages of 6 and 14 that there was no deterioration in renal function but there was transient excretion of various surrogate markers of renal damage, such as beta2- macroglobulin for a week. So, the recommendation that an interval of at least 15 days should be left between two successive ESWL treatments.16 However, at present, there is no significant evidence to suggest that ESWL in the pediatric population has any significant long-term effects.\n\n\nFigure 1 ESWL in pediatric patient under GA\n\nPercutaneous Nephrolithotomy\n\nPCNL has replaced open surgery and at present is considered to be the first line of treatment for renal stones greater than 20 mm with stone clearance rates of more than 90%.17\n\nPCNL was initially described by Johannson and Fernstrom in 1976. Since then, it has become the main stay of treatment for treatment of renal calculi. PCNL in children was described in 1985 as a case series of seven patients aged between 5 years and 18 years using standard adult instruments.18 However, with the continuous decrease in size of optics, nephroscopes and availability of better stone fragmentation technology has allowed the use of smaller tracts for PCNL with decreased complication rates. Mini-PCNL, with tract size up to 20 Fr, ultra-mini PCNL (11 Fr, 13 Fr), mini-micro PCNL (8 Fr), micro-PCNL with sheath size of 4.85 Fr have led to better acceptability of PCNL even in smaller children.\n\nPCNL is performed in general anesthesia. Initially, cystoscopy is performed and a 4 Fr or 5 Fr ureteric catheter is placed in the pelvicalyceal system. It is used for opacification and distention of PCS and irrigation intraoperatively. Then, the child is placed in prone position. The initial puncture can be done using ultrasound guided or fluoro-guided puncture. The initial puncture is most important part of the procedure as the pediatric kidneys are more mobile than the adult kidneys. The pediatric kidneys tend to move away during the initial puncture and dilatation. After confirmation of puncture in the PCS, dilatation can be done using a serial dilator, one step dilator or a balloon dilator. The mini PCNL sheaths are available in different size and tract can be dilated according to the stone size and fragmentation device usage (Figure 2). The stone can be fragmented using conventional lithoclast, lasers like holmium laser or new thulium laser fiber. Use of special devices like Shock pulse and Trilogy has also decreased the operative time and improved the stone clearance rates.\n\nUse of suction devices in sheath or device have added a new dimension for the stone free rates and discussion between dusting and fragmentation in PCNL. A nephrostomy tube can be kept at the end of the procedure. The overall success rates in PCNL range from 81–100% after ancillary procedures (Table 1).19,20,21,22\n\nTable 1 Overall success rates after PCNL range from 81–100% (includes ancillary procedures).\n\n\n  \n    \n      Study\n      Renal units\n      Mean age\n      Tract\n      Stone size\n      Complications\n      Success rate (after auxiliary procedures)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Mahmud M et al23\n      30\n      3.8 years (1.4–5)\n      &lt; 22 Fr\n      2.3–5 cm (1.3-6 cm)\n      Overall=6%\n      100%\n    \n    \n      Zeren et al24\n      67\n      10–14 years (7.9)\n      24–30 Fr\n      25–2075 mm2\n      Hemorrhage=23.9%\n      96.7%\n    \n    \n      Manohar et al25\n      35\n      11 months to 4.5 years\n      &lt; 22 Fr\n      140 mm2\n      Transfusion rate=5%\n      86%\n    \n    \n      Salah et al26\n      138\n      8–14 years (8.9)\n      26 Fr\n      124–624 mm2 (507 mm2)\n      Urine leak=8%, Bleeding=0.7%, Retroperitoneal collection=0.7%\n      98.5%\n    \n    \n      Nouralizadeh et al27\n      20\n      3.1 years\n      26 Fr\n      33 (20–46)\n      Overall=15.38%\n      91.67%\n    \n  \n\n\n\nFigure 2 Miniperc nephroscope sheath in place (left), nephroscopy being performed (centre) and intracorporeal lithotripsy with Holmium laser (right)\n\nDisadvantages of PCNL\n\nThe PCNL has its own set of complications ranging from 15% to 39%. Most common complications are fever and blood loss requiring transfusions. Since the organs in pediatric patients are crowded and near, they are prone to complications like hemothorax, hydrothorax or colonic injury. However, with the use of US guided puncture and meticulous technique, these complications can be avoided.\n\nFlexible Ureteroscopy (fURS/RIRS)\n\nDue to continuous advancements in miniaturization of flexible ureteroscopes, RIRS is now possible in pediatric patients with minimal complications. Historically, RIRS was avoided in children owing to complications like ureteral ischemia, ureteric perforation and stricture formation. However, the flexible scopes are now available in sizes as small as 7.5 Fr which can be easily accommodated in pediatric ureters. Also, development of small laser fibers as small as 200 microns with good fragmentation and dusting capabilities has improved the stone clearance rates substantially up to 85% to 90%. Maximum complications are seen in children who weight less than 20 kgs.28 AUA guidelines also suggest that in stones less than 20 mm, URS or ESWL is recommended. fURS has to be performed under general anesthesia in children. The child has to be placed in modified lithotomy position like adults with adequate padding of pressure points. Firstly, a guide wire is placed in under c arm guidance into the ureter using a cystoscope. The ureter can be dilated up to 10 Fr serial dilators. Ureteral access sheath (10/12, 11/13, 12/14 Fr) can be used. Access sheath facilitate the flexible ureteroscope during a tortuous ureter. If any point the ureter does not accommodate. Ureter should not be overdilated. Often sheathless procedure can be performed. In very small children, it is better to do presenting. Care must be taken not to damage the ureter as well as the urethra.\n\nThe advent of disposable flexible ureteroscopes of size up to 7.5 Fr has ushered a new interest in flexible endoscopy. Additionally, newer lasers are coming up like high powered holmium laser, thulium laser fiber which claim to have better dusting and fragmentation than a conventional low powered holmium laser.\n\nDisadvantages of fURS\n\nThe complications of fURS include infection, sepsis, bleeding, ureteric injuries and strictures. If a ureteric injury is identified, then the procedure should be abandoned and a ureteral stent should be placed.\n\nRole of Laparoscopy and Open Surgery\n\nThe AUA and Endourological society does not recommend routine use of open, laparoscopic or robotic assisted surgeries for renal stones in pediatric patients except in cases of congenital PUJ Obstruction.28\n\nConclusion\n\nThe endourological treatment remains the mainstay of pediatric stone disease in the present era. Pediatric renal stones, though uncommon can present unique challenges to the urologist. However, the principles guiding the treatment essentially remain the same with minor modifications. First and foremost, aim remains complete stone clearance with minimum re treatment sessions thus minimizing complications.\n\nThe use of ESWL has reduced substantially due to low success rates than endourology and miniaturization and improved optics of instruments. ESWL can be used as an adjunct to endourology treatment.\n\nThe advent of mini PCNL, micro PCNL and mini-micro PCNL, sleek and slender instruments, US guided punctures have paved way for a better acceptance and low complication rates in pediatric patients.\n\nRIRS with flexible ureteroscopes has also become a routine and can become the standard of care for renal stones in due course of time owing to decreased diameters of flexible ureteroscopes, improved imaging and better availability of different lasers for stone fragmentation.\n\nThe management of ureteric and bladder stones are discussed in the relevant chapters of the book.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  The endourological treatment remains the mainstay of pediatric stone disease in the present era. Pediatric renal stones present unique challenges to the urologist. Primary aim is complete stone clearance with minimum re-treatment session and minimal complications.\n  ESWL is still a treatment option for renal stones with stone free rates between 68% to 84%. Though the use of ESWL has reduced substantially due to lower success rates than endourological management, it can be used as an adjunct to the endourology treatment.\n  The advent of mini PCNL, micro PCNL and mini-micro PCNL, sleek and slender instruments, US guided punctures have paved way for a better acceptance and low complication rates in pediatric patients. Additionally, energy sources like high power holmium laser, thulium laser fiber (TLF), Trilogy and Shockpulse have improved stone clearance rates. Use of sheaths with suctions has an added advantage.\n  Flexible ureterorenoscopes are now thinner and can be accommodated in pediatric ureters. Additionally, they also have better optics in comparison to their older counterparts. Care should be taken that ureter should not be over dilated. Often, sheathless procedure can be performed.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCD S Jr, AC S, JM H. Prevalence of kidney stones in the. . DOI: 10.1016/j.eururo.2012.03.052.  \n\nStates U.

        "title": "Urolithiasis—Ureteral Surgical Management",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nNephrolithiasis is the formation of stones inside kidney due to deposition of various salts or minerals. These stones can remain asymptomatic for long periods of time until they become large enough to become symptomatic.1 This may present as a combination of flank or abdominal pain, urinary tract infection, or hematuria.2 However in infants and younger children, the presentation may be less specific with symptoms such as constipation, vomiting, dysuria, and generalized abdominal tenderness.1\n\nEmbryology\n\nThe kidney develops from three primary layers of the mesoderm—the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. The pronephros is the most primitive stage of kidney development. It will eventually regress and is no longer part of the adult kidney. The mesonephros eventually forms part of the male genitalia ductal system and regresses in females. The ureteric bud branches off from the mesonephros and will induce the mesoderm to start formation of the ductal system and the ureters. The metanephros develops into the nephron system.3\n\nEpidemiology\n\nPediatric nephrolithiasis is much less common than in the adult population.1 Historically, the prevalence in children is likely between 2–3%, but this number has been steadily on the rise.2 Studies over the last 20 years have estimated this increase to be between 4–10% per year, with 12- to 17-year-old adolescents having the most rapid rates of increase.4 It is also thought that female patients may be at a higher risk for stone disease than male patients, presumably due to the higher risk of urinary tract infections in females as compared to males. No identifiable cause is found in most patients, however 9–24% of patients will have a potential origin like metabolic abnormalities , neurologic disease, or a urinary tract malformation.2 There may also be a geographical component to stone formation within the United States, with higher rates of incidence of nephrolithiasis being present in the Midwest and Southeast regions.4 Of children who present with stone disease, between 75–84% will present with low serum citrate and high calcium levels and 4–20% will have a simultaneous urinary tract infection.4,2 There may further be an environmental aspect to stone formation as well with greater rates being associated in hot and dry climates due to a higher risk of dehydration.1 Calcium phosphate stones were previously the most commonly seen in children, but this has now shifted to calcium oxalate stones instead.4\n\nPathogenesis\n\nMany different metabolic, anatomic, genetic, and environmental factors may play a role in stone formation. Children presenting with nephrolithiasis have a higher likelihood of having a genetic cause, with the prevalence being around 15–17% of all children who present with a stone burden.5,6 Anatomic anomalies such as a single kidney or a uretero-pelvic obstruction can also cause stone formation due to urinary stasis.7\n\nStruvite stones are traditionally associated with an infectious nidus, particularly from urease producing bacteria.8 This increases the ammonia content and raises the pH, which causes phosphate and magnesium to precipitate and results in struvite stones.7 Over time, however, the predominant etiology for nephrolithiasis have changed from infectious causes to now primarily metabolic causes.7\n\nHypercalciuria is one of the more common causes of stone formation in children. This is traditionally due to changes in calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal or renal systems or disturbances in bone formation. Genetic disorders that can also cause hypercalciuria include Fanconi syndrome, Bartter syndrome, Liddle’s syndrome.7 Children tend to be less likely to form uric acid stones due to their higher urine pH.9 However, inborn errors of purine and pyrimidine metabolism can present with uric acid urolithiasis due to a high uric acid level.9 This includes hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase deficiency which can lead to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase super activity, both of which commonly present with uric acid stones.9 Lesch-Nyhan patients who take allopurinol are also at risk of xanthine stone formation.9 Other causes of hyperuricemia can include probenecid, mannitol, losartan, or high-dose salicylates.9\n\nCystinuria is another genetic disease that can cause cystine stone formation due to defects in cystine and other dibasic amino acid reabsorption.10 This disease also has the predilection to cause recurrent stones due to the poor solubility of cystine.7 Other disease-stone associations include calcium oxalate stones in Chron disease and cystic fibrosis, and struvite, calcium phosphate, and calcium oxalate stones in myelomeningocele.10\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nAs previously mentioned, nephrolithiasis may present with a wide range of symptoms including flank pain, hematuria, and dysuria. A history of recurrent UTIs or a urinalysis with isolated leukocytes may be also further indication of renal stone formation.1 If nephrolithiasis is suspected, a renal and bladder ultrasound is the appropriate first diagnostic step in the pediatric population to confirm a stone burden due to its low cost, speed, and the lack of radiation and sedation needed.4 If the ultrasound is inconclusive or further imaging is required due to a high clinical suspicion, only then should ultra-low dose non-contrast CT be used. It is important to note however that adding a CT scan post-ultrasound very infrequently changes management.8 Stones that were not seen on ultrasound were also shown to not be significant clinically.11 In the past 20 years, there has been a shift toward using CT more frequently, but the advantages in image sensitivity that it provides must be weighed with the cons it poses specifically in children.8 On x-ray and CT, there may also be differences identifiable for the different types of stones. For example, cystine stones are radiopaque while struvite stones can be seen on x-ray due to their calcium content.9\n\nInitial laboratory workups for children presenting with nephrolithiasis symptoms traditionally also includes a 24-hour urine collection and serum studies to evaluate various ion and solute levels.9 In children who are presenting with a first nephrolithiasis event, it is important to also evaluate for underlying metabolic or anatomic causes of stone formation.1 A common initial laboratory workup may include a urine analysis with evaluation of crystal formation. This may provide some indication of either genetic or metabolic causes of stone formation such as hyperuricosuria, hypercalciuria, or cystinuria.1 Uric acid stones will also need urine and serum uric acid levels, while xanthine stones will need serum uric acid levels as well as 24-hour xanthine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid excretion. If the stone is passed spontaneously, it is also prudent to further analyze the stone itself, traditionally through x-ray diffraction or infrared spectroscopy. This is even possible for stone fragments &lt; 1 mg that are passed even after lithotripsy.1\n\nTreatment Options and Outcomes\n\nInitial treatment for nephrolithiasis should always start with increasing the patient’s fluid status in order to decrease urinary solute concentration, usually totaling to 70–100 mL/kg/day.1 Acute interventions should also focus on urinary decompression if necessary, usually in the setting of UTIs, pyelonephritis, or other acute systemic symtpoms.11 This can be done via percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tube or stent placement with cystoscopy.11 If infectious processes are suspected, the appropriate antibiotics should also be initiated. Uric acid stone burdens may benefit from urine alkalinization or allopurinol if significant hyperuricemia is present.9 The patient’s pain status must also be evaluated and treated with appropriate analgesics.10\n\nIf the stone is &lt;10 mm and non-obstructive, a combination of alpha-blocker or calcium channel blockers may be used to prevent contraction of the smooth muscle of the ureter to allow spontaneous stone passage with this medical expulsion therapy.1 Surgical interventions may be required if a stone is not likely to pass spontaneously and now primarily occur in a minimally invasive fashion. This may be required in up to 30% of children presenting with nephrolithiasis, while stones &lt;4 mm are more likely to pass spontaneously.8,10 Open procedures are still performed, but primarily in the setting of anatomical abnormalities or an abnormally high stone burden. The type of surgical approach appropriate, however, is specific to the stone size and location.\n\nFor example, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is first line for proximal ureteric stones while ureteroscopy (URS) is preferred for distal ureteric stones.1 ESWL involves shock pulses directed at the stone itself.12 Starting from low energy levels and working up, the shearing forces produced are intended to disrupt the stone and break it up into fragments which can then be spontaneously passed. URS involves using a guidewire to lead the ureteroscope to the location of the stone. A laser is then placed in direct contact with the stone to fragment it.13 Stones in the lower calyxes of the kidneys are usually removed with either retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) or micro-perc technique.1 RIRS involves access the stone location by ascending the urinary tract through the ureter and upwards.14 Micro-perc is a version of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)—these techniques involve making an incision in the flank and inserting a needle to access the stone for extraction or fragmentation via laser.14 Micro-perc involves the use of a smaller needle. Once inside the renal pelvis, the approach largely depends on the size of the stone. If greater than 15 mm, RIRS, micro-perc, or PCNL is preferred while ESWL is used for stones &lt;15 mm. PCNL is also used for staghorn caliculi due to complex nature of their shape.1,10\n\nComplications\n\nEach of the techniques described above have been shown to have significant benefits, but also can have various complications as well. Stones larger than 15 mm may need multiple approaches because they provide a larger technical difficulty. The micro-perc technique has a high stone-free rate post-procedure, but has a decreased effectivity in stones larger than 20 mm.1\n\nWhile ESWL is a commonly used, it requires great focusing so as not to disturb surrounding structures. There are also concerns about an increased risk for hypertension in the pediatric population as well as renal colic due to potential scarring and subsequent lower renal function.4,11 Furthermore, patients will still need to spontaneously pass the stone fragments that result from this procedure which could cause further pain and discomfort.\n\nAlthough it has a very high stone-free rate, PCNL is more invasive than other techniques and thus poses more risks such as the need for blood products after hemorrhage.11 URS also has been proven to be more difficult in children due to the smaller ureter size than must be maneuvered.4 Stent placement prior to URS have been shown to improve ureteral access and lower complication rates, however non-stented URS should be trialed prior to stent placement.11 Furthermore, URS also poses risks for subsequent UTI post-operatively as well.8\n\nThe amount of radiation present during these different procedures is also an important factor when treating children—studies have shown URS to have significantly lower radiation exposure than other techniques like PCNL.4 This is especially important to consider when repeat interventions are performed for multiple instances of stone formation.11\n\nSuggested Follow Up\n\nAfter the initial stone incident, a subsequent urinalysis should be performed in 3–6 months.4 This however varies significantly with regards to institutional guidelines and provider preference.15 As children have a high recurrence rate of stone formation, important risk factors or causes should be investigated to prevent subsequent incidences. Some follow up can be more specific to the stone type. For example, patients with hypercalciuria can be placed on thiazide diuretics and followed up to measure subsequent urine calcium levels and uric acid stones may require follow up of serum and urine uric acid levels especially if treated with allopurinol.10 More generally, children should also be advised to increase their fluid intake to prevent dehydration stimulated stone formation.\n\nConclusions\n\nNephrolithiasis in children can be due to many causes such as an infectious nidus or metabolic disturbances. Initial imaging involves ultrasound to confirm stone burden, and initial management should focus on pain stabilization and urinary decompression. Further management is highly dependent on stone size and location. If unable to pass spontaneously or through MET, surgical interventions like ESWL, URS, RIRS, micro-perc, or PCNL should be considered. Follow up should include subsequent urinalysis and serum and urine studies.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Initial imaging should be renal and bladder ultrasound, with CT being used only if absolutely necessary.\n  If unable to pass spontaneously, surgical management is highly dependent on stone size and location. Possible interventions include ESWL, URS, RIRS, micro-perc, or PCNL.\n  Follow up for nephrolithiasis should include urinalysis 3–6 months post-incident and any necessary serum and urine studies to monitor metabolite levels.\n\n\nSummary\n\nPediatric nephrolithiasis has historically occurred in 2–3% of children, but this number has been steadily on the rise. Many different metabolic, anatomic, genetic, and environmental factors may play a role in stone formation, but children presenting with nephrolithiasis have a higher likelihood of having a genetic cause. Presenting symptoms can vary, but initial workup should include a renal and bladder ultrasound, 24-hour- urine collection, and serum studies. Treatment options should start with fluid repletion, but other acute interventions can involve both medical and procedural management. Each can have their own complications, and thus suggested follow-up is within 3–6 months with a subsequent urinalysis.\n\nReferences\n\n\nMarra G, Taroni F, Berrettini A, Montanari E, Manzoni G, Montini G.

        "title": "Urolithiasis—Bladder",
        "content": "Introduction\n\n‘Urinary stones’ is a malady known to humans since early times; evident from the findings of urinary stones in Egyptian mummies. Sir G E Smith found a bladder calculus, dated to 4800 BC, in the mummy of the pelvis of a 16-years old in 1901 in El Amrah, Egypt. The calculus had concentric laminations of calcium oxalate, ammonium magnesium phosphate around a uric acid nucleus.1,2,3 Sushruta, India, 600 BC, in his medical text, Sushruta Samhita, described formation of bladder stones and perineal lithotomy! Urinary stone disease finds its mention in Ancient Greek texts and recognition by Hippocrates. Ancient Arabic medicine has perineal lithotomy described in a book by Al-Razi in 841–926 AD.4\n\nHistorical urinary stone disease literature is fascinating with the morbidity of the disease, the mortality of the surgical attempted cures, and the descriptions of “lithotmus, stein-schnieider, clysters, lithotryptors to crush stone!\n\nIncidence\n\nThe incidence in adults is understood to be at 10-12% lifetime risk. Though it was thought to be a male predominant disease, the gender bias seems to be equalizing. The cost of management of urinary stone disease is thought to be over 2 billion dollars in 2010 to over $10 billion annually.5 There has been over a doubling of incidence (from 7.9 to 18.5 per 100,000 children) in just over a decade in South Carolina..6,7,8 A Chinese meta-analysis has a similar observation.9\n\nFactors Related to Formation of Stones in the Urinary Tract\n\nGeographic distribution of stone disease has been well known. The ‘stone belt’ in the southern USA is an example. In the middle and far east, there is endemicity for bladder stones. In the UK, ‘stone districts’ such as Norfolk, were common during the 19th century, with subsequent decline in the endemic bladder stone incidence with improved nutrition. Colonel McCarrison noted the endemicity of bladder stones in India and its similarity in the UK.\n\nUrinary stone disease may be related to many factors including diet, environment, geographical location, metabolic and genetic factors. The geographical variability is multifactorial with arid climates, water intake, salt intake, diet including protein load, fruits and vegetable intake.\n\nBladder calculi could be idiopathic/endemic, secondary and migrant. The incidence of bladder calculi is less in the developed world as compared to the developing world and may be attributed to a diet lacking in animal proteins. There is an overall decrease in the incidence of endemic stones ‘the stone wave’. The incidence of bladder calculi in Pakistan has reduced from 70% in 1984 to 18% in 2007 and similarly from Satpura ranges in central India.10 Still, the Afro-Asian endemic bladder calculi belt continues to be a cause of morbidity from endemic urinary stone disease. An epidemiological study reveals the disease in Asia in the 20th century is similar to that in Europe in the nineteenth century.11 The endemic bladder calculi are commonly see in children between 1-5 years, with a peak at 3 years, likely due to weaning period and single cereal diet.10 They are more common in males with M:F = 10:1, this may presumably be due to differences in urethral anatomy.12\n\nIt is unclear if augmentation cystoplasty stone disease incidence follows the geographic distribution of urolithiasis.\n\nStone formation is also related to UTIs and anatomic urological anomalies. One study found 18/54 children with calculi had associated genitourinary anomalies and another found calculi associated with genitourinary anomalies in 35.9% children.13,14 80% of children with stones associated with infections are male. Infection related stones are found usually under 5 years of age.\n\nBacterial infections with proteus, pseudomonas, klebsiella and enterococci are strongly associated with stone formation, as the urease breaks down urea to form ammonium and bicarbonate, favorable for struvite stones. Matrix concretion, a soft radiolucent mucoid substance produced with infection may calcify ready and account for rapid formation of infection related stones. In one study, frequency of hypercalciuria and hyperuricosuria was higher in children with VUR.15 Eight to eighteen percent of children with VUR have stone disease and some may present later in adulthood.16,17\n\nObesity and weight gain are independent factors in the development of urinary stones in adults and yet less evident in children. In one study, BMI of more than 30 had an odds ratio of 1.7 as compared to BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m.218 The disease may be changing from a disease of poorly nourished to be one associated with obesity.19\n\nBladder Augmentation\n\nBladder augmentation was first described in the canine model by Tizzoni and Foggi in 1888 and von Mikulicz described it in humans a year later.20 The number of botox injections to the bladder have progressively increased since 2006, going from a few hundred to over 4,000 in UK and it is not surprising that the number of bladder augmentations is reducing, as reported in the study by Biers et al.20 The reduction in the incidence of augmentation may also be related to availability of anticholinergics, CIC but also decreasing incidence of anomalies such as spina bifida. Though ileocystoplasty is the commonest augmentation, there are many other segments of the bowel from stomach to the sigmoid colon, including ileocecal segments that are used. Also, autoaugmentation and ureterocystoplasty are other modalities of augmenting the hostile bladder.21,22 Augmentation helped us move away from incontinent reservoirs to continent reservoirs. It has replaced urinary diversion as the preferred surgical method for neurogenic bladder or congenital bladder issues. The indications are incontinence or renal damage in presence of a small capacity high pressure bladder. This move towards augmentation was facilitated by works of Bramble and Adams in the late 80s.23,24 It was encouraged by the advent of CISC and 10-75% of patients require it to empty the bladder. Combination of anticholinergics and CISC increase the rate of continence with cystoplasty with low bladder filling pressures and preservation of renal function. Augmentation cystoplasty also remains an important tool in preserving the renal function post-transplant in patients with hostile bladders. There is no confirmation yet that the best graft survival remains in non-augmented bladders.25,26\n\nStone formation is common after bladder augmentation. It is reported from 3-40% but was reported in over 50% in the series by Palmer et al.27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35\n\nThe mean time for stone formation was found to be 30.3 months and most stone formation occurred within 3 years of the augmentation as reported by Zhang H et al.36 The stone formation is reported from 25 months to 39 months.29,37 In another report, the median time for stone formation in adults with a history of augmentation cystoplasty was reported to be 16 years, a range of 5–38 years.38\n\nStone Composition in Children\n\n\n  Calcium oxalate: 45–65 %\n  Calcium phosphate: 14–30%\n  Struvite: 13%\n  Cystine: 5%\n  Uric acid: 4%\n  Miscellaneous: 4%\n\n\nThe metabolic derangements that lead to increased incidence of stone formation in children without augmentation are hypophosphaturia, hypomagnesuria, hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, xanthinuria, cystinuria.\n\nIn patients with augmented bladders, infectious stones are most likely to be struvite, followed by carbonate apatite, ammonium acid ureate or mixed, while non-infectious stones are most likely to be calcium phosphate followed by calcium oxalate and uric acid.39\n\nStones are less common in Augmentation cystoplasties who can void spontaneously and efficiently and occur in less than 2% of patients. The incidence is 5 times more if CISC is used per urethra but rises to 10 times if using a Mitrofanoff channel. This finding implies a role of stasis.40\n\nThe addition of bladder neck procedure, catheterizable channel or both with augmentation significantly increased the risk of stone formation as compared to augmentation alone..41 A stoma created at time of AC was associated with an increased hazard of bladder stones. The 10 year cumulative risk of developing lower tract stones was expected to be 13–36%.42\n\nHensle et al reported over 10 percent incidence in their study and were concerned that sedentary habitus in spina bifida patients would lead to more stones.34 They subsequently in other study showed that the patients with immobility and sensory impairment were worse off and similar to Nurse et al finding reservoir calculi in 66% as compared to 15% those who used native urethra.34,40 Bladder stones occur about 10 times more often in SB patients than in the population and approximately 1% of patients with spina bifida develop stones annually after augmentation.43 The predicted ‘lifetime incidence’ was 2.25 episodes per 1,000 patient-years. 14/260 patients (5.4%) spina bifida patients were found to have bladder stones in a retrospective study by Veenboer et al.44\n\nStones are commonly triple phosphate implying that bacteriuria with urease producing bacteria (proteus, klebsiella) may be the cause as found in many reports. In one study, patients with augmented bladders were typically linked to metabolic abnormalities and were non-infectious.39\n\nUric acid stone formation has been reported in bladder augmentation using stomach.45\n\nCloacal exstrophy patients may be prone to metabolic abnormalities that increases the stone risk and affect composition of stones. Szymanski et al found cloacal exstrophy patients to have uric acid stones significantly more than other types.39\n\nMetabolic factors in patients with augmentation cystoplasty that have been associated with stone formation like hypocitraturia and high calcium phosphate ratio in bladder mucus may also predispose to stone formation.46\n\nUp to 60% of bladder stones in post enteric bladder augmentation are due to metabolic factors. The loss of bowel length and ileal volume, malabsorption of bile salts leading to steatorrhea, relative dehydration due to diarrhea, loss of enteric bicarbonate, and eventual metabolic acidosis resulting into hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria and hypocitraturia. Mobilization of the calcium phosphate from the bony stores due to immobilization or to buffer the metabolic acidosis may also lead to hypercalciuria.38,47\n\nMetallic staples used in the operation are known to be associated with stone formation.48 Even absorbable staples used for approximating reconfigured bowel segments have been found to be associated with the stone formation with a ghost of the staple found in the calculus mass![]\n\nStones seen in exstrophy bladder augmentation may be due to the keratine elements including at the time of repair.49 Unintentional inclusion of the para-exstrophy skin, squamous metaplasia in the bladder mucosa de novo or down the suprapubic tract sites were found to be the site of stone formation.50\n\nThough the above multiple factors such as augmentation with bowel, presence of mucous, bacteria, nidus from non-absorbable material are all found to have a role in development of stones, it is still unclear which factor is most important.\n\nSeromuscular bladder augmentation is an alternative to ileocystoplasty and may be associated with lesser stone formation due to lack of bladder mucous. Though Odeh et al did not find any stone formation in SMBA in the 10 patients as compared to the other 30 who underwent standard ileocystoplasty it was not significant.51\n\nIn 1998 it was expected advances in tissue engineering and alternatives to methods of augmentation will relegate the stone formation to “arena of historical significance”![]\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nPresentation\n\n\n  Presenting features can include:\n    \n      Pain or discomfort in suprapubic or hypogastric region\n        \n          Pain can be referred to the penis\n        \n      \n      Frequency or urgency\n      Turbid sandy urine\n      Nocturnal enuresis\n      Dribbling of urine\n      Terminal dysuria\n      Hematuria\n      Strangury and urinary retention\n      Non-specific signs particularly in endemic stones include anemia, malnutrition, conjunctival hemorrhage due to straining, fever secondary to UTI, dehydration, rectal prolapse\n    \n  \n\n\nHistory and Examination\n\n\n  Exclude underlying structural abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract\n  Diet (excessive salt, ketogenic, excess animal protein, low calcium, cereal, calcium), fluid intake (inadequate, fructose rich drinks),\n  Medications—anticonvulsants (topiramate, zonisamide), antibiotics (ceftriaxone), diuretics (frusemide, acetazolamide), vitamin C and D intoxication, uricosuric acid agents, corticosteroids, protease inhibitors (indinavir)\n  Family history of calculi, hematuria, or renal failure.

Also reduces bacterial load and recurrent UTI.58 With daily high volume irrigation the incidence is &lt; 5% over 10 years follow up.38\n  Hensle et al reduced the incidence of stone occurrence from 36 to 7% incidence with a bladder washout irrigation regime. They used 120–240 mL saline with a flush of Gentamicin once a week.34\n  Kronner et al also reported a 7% incidence of stone formation after the use of a washout regime.41\n  Recurrent stone formers—use of mucolytic has been trialled, however has not been shown to benefit, although it is still advocated by some in the event of severe mucous production.38\n  Washout with acetylcysteine solution (10 mL in 20% acetylcyteine solution with 40 mL saline) 2–4 times per day for severe mucous.59 They did a high frequency follow up to ensure compliance. 28 children included with formation of stones in 7%.\n\n\nType of Augment\n\n\n  Seromuscular bladder augmentation recorded no calculi after an average 75 month follow up (range 36–120 months).51\n  Stone development is rarely seen with gastrocystoplasties as it could be attributed to less mucus, acidic pH and less bacteriuria.32,41\n  It is advisable to not use non absorbable staples or wires in surgeries involving the urine reservoir-exstrophy bladder pubis closures or bowel for augmentation.\n  New technology with autologous and tissue engineered augments are still in the experimental phase of development and may show some promise against the development of stones.60\n\n\nDiet\n\nFruits and vegetables containing magnesium, potassium, phytates and citrate may contribute to reducing the calcium load and thus calcium stone formation, but this action may be mitigated due to the oxalate content in some vegetables. Increasing fruit and vegetable intake in children with hypocitraturia is protective.61\n\nAnimal proteins, red meat and poultry, with sulphur containing amino acids (methionine, cystine, homocysteine and taurine) can result in net acidemia with resultant hypocitraturia and those rich in purines can lead to hyperuricosuria. Both hypocitraturia and hyperuricosuria can result in stone disease.62\n\nThe daily recommended sodium intake is recommended to be less than 1.5 g for children aged 1–3 years, less than 1.9 g for ages 4–8 years, less than 2.2 g for ages 9–13 years and less than 2.3 g for ages 14–18 years.\n\nLow calcium intake does not correlate with low stone formation, rather high calcium intake may bind with enteral oxalate, reducing oxalate absorption and thus reducing urinary oxalate excretion.63\n\nThe dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) encourages low fat dairy products, lean meats, fish and poultry, whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables. DASH helps in reducing red meat and fructose intake, adequate calcium intake and increasing the urinary citrate. It may risk increasing the oxalate intake. In one study, participants with highest DASH scores had a low relative risk of urinary stone disease.64\n\nSurgical Treatment\n\nTraditional surgical management of bladder stones relate to the size and type of stones. Large stones either require open surgery or endoscopic or percutaneous litholapaxy. The added difficulty in the augmented bladder is risk of bladder rupture and access to the bladder. Often these children have conditions that made urethral access difficult, such as those with structural anomalies or surgically closed bladder necks.\n\nTreatment is classified as below\n\n\n  Endoscopic\n    \n      Electrohydraulic (less common due to mobility of stones)\n      Ballistic / pneumatic\n      Ultrasonic\n      Combination\n      Laser Holmium YAG\n      Last Thulium\n    \n  \n  Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL)\n  Open\n\n\nEndoscopic\n\nEndoscopic technology in the late 1990s emerged to allow better access for the pediatric population. Endoscopic management including dilation of the urethra in selected older patients was performed, with electrohydraulic lithotripsy or simple extraction with forceps or basket retrieval.65\n\nAccess to the bladder can be achieved via the urethra, or if present, via the Mitrofanoff or Monti channel.\n\nPercutaneous Access with Cystoscopic Guidance\n\nPercutaneous access is also feasible, and seems to compare favorably when compared to the open group, without the complications of open surgery.66 Percutaneous cystolitholapaxy has become the treatment of choice for children, due to difficulty with the size restrictions of the male urethra.67\n\nA guidewire is placed percutaneously with cystoscopic visualization, and the tract dilated to allow insertion of an access sheath such as the Amplatz sheath (Cook Medical, US) in various sizes. A nephroscope can then be used for direct stone retrieval or litholapaxy.68 Other instruments for percutaneous access are also possible such as a laparoscopic port.49 In order to prevent trauma to the bladder with lithotripsy equipment a laparoscopic entrapment bag can be used to capture the stones before fragmentation and extraction.69\n\nTransvesical laparoendoscopic single site surgery has been described for primary bladder stones, however not in patients with augmented bladders.70\n\nMitrofanoff / Monti Channel Access\n\nComplete stone retrieval is possible via the catheterizable channel. This requires serial dilation and the use of a sheath such as the Amplatz. This method has been shown to be safe without significant trauma to the catheterizable channel.55\n\nMore recently smaller scopes such as a 12 Fr mini PCNL kit have been reported with successful outcomes.71\n\nOpen surgery may still be required for large stones that are not amenable for minimally invasive access.72 This occurrence is less likely with current surveillance regimes and with prevention strategies outlined below.\n\nOpen Surgery\n\nIn a recent systematic review of &gt; 1,000 cases Davis et al found that open surgery, transurethral and percutaneous cystolitholapaxy has comparable stone free rates, and ESWL was less effective.73\n\nSuggested Follow-Up\n\n\n  In the augmented patient, annual abdominal radiograph and ultrasound is suggested to surveillance.74\n\n\nConclusions\n\nBladder stones are a long-known issue that has troubled us for millennia. Most are associated with bacterial infection and 80% in male patients. Bladder augmentation using small or large bowel is associated with stone formation, from infection and mucous production. Urine composition can be altered either with diet, medication or flushing to help prevent the stones from forming. Surgical treatment is mainly endoscopic, with the ability to access the bladder percutaneously for excellent clearance without damage to the urethra.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Urinary stones occur in augmented bladder in up to 50%, with increased incidence if catheterizable channel is used within 3 years of augmentation, and sedentary patients.\n  Infection, metabolic factors, type of operation and staples play a role in stone formation. Stones are largely calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate or struvite if infection related.\n  Diet management, medical therapy and bladder washout may reduce the risk of stone formation\n  Continuous surveillance is necessary.\n  Multimodality treatment with use of endoscopic, laser, shockwave lithotripsy all has a role in individualized management of this children.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nEllis H.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nPediatric urolithiasis is on the raise with an annual increasing rate of approximately 5–10%.1 Various metabolic, genetic, anatomic, and environmental/dietary factors are responsible for this change. It is increasingly recognized that urolithiasis is a systemic condition with significant morbidity due to its association with various diseases such as cardio-vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome.2,3,4,5,6,7,8 Urolithiasis has a high recurrence rate with potential for chronicity and for the development of renal insufficiency.9,10,11,12 Therefore, adequate management of pediatric urolithiasis is important to prevent recurrence and its associated complications, as well as to protect kidney function.\n\nInitial Evaluation of a Child with Urolithiasis\n\nAn initial comprehensive diagnostic evaluation should be performed in every child who presents with a first episode of urolithiasis because it will guide treatment and will allow a better prevention strategy. Due to the multifactorial etiology of urolithiasis (metabolic, anatomic, genetic, dietary, environmental), children who have an obvious risk for kidney stone development should also undergo a detailed work-up. The initial evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, laboratory investigation, and radiologic imaging of the urine tract as presented in Figure 1. There is no consensus on what serum chemistry should be performed as part of the initial work-up, but calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, uric acid, creatinine, and urea nitrogen are initial preferred tests sufficient to identify renal tubular acidosis, hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and renal insufficiency. Qualitative cysteine testing is an important initial screening in cystinuria. Microscopy is additionally used to screen for various crystals in the urinary sediment.\n\n\nFigure 1 Initial evaluation of a child with urolithiasis.\n\nSpot urines for calcium, citrate, uric acid, oxalate and cystine can be obtained as the initial screening for a metabolic abnormality, and normal references by age and expressed units (mg/mg or mmol/mmol) are available in Table 1. Spot urines are particularly important in children who are not toilet trained. Whenever possible, urine solute concentrations and excretory rates in timed 24-hour urine collection should be obtained to confirm the results of initial screening with spot urine samples. The benefit of performing a 24-hour urine analysis has been proven in children who underwent at least one 24-hour urine collection because a significant reduction in the risk of their stone recurrence was found compared to those who did not have such a test.13 The timed 24 hour urine collection provides information on urine volume and saturation, as well as on 24 hour urinary excretion of calcium, phosphorus, oxalate, citrate, uric acid, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. There is ongoing debate on the benefit of a single urine collection compared to repeated 24-hour urine collections.14 Due to diurnal variation in diet and fluid intake, two initial 24-hour urine collections should be performed. Urine creatinine should be checked for the completeness of urine collection (urine creatinine of more than 15 mg/kg/day is desired). The timed collection should be performed without altering the child’s usual fluid intake, diet or activity in the absence of a urinary tract infection, and should be done at least a month after the spontaneous passage of stone or surgical intervention. Results can be interpreted with respect to weight, body surface area, and urine creatinine (Table 1). Patients should be asked to complete a dietary diary at the same time of the 24-hour urine collection. The diary should include the type and amount of each consumed food and drink.\n\nTable 1 Normal Value for Urinary Excretion of Metabolites. * Same value for mg/mg and mmol/mmol; **A range for normal random citrate values is presented in the table to account for regional variations.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Constituent\n      Age\n      Random in mg/mg (mmol/mmol)\n      Timed (all ages)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Calcium\n      0 to 6 months\n      &lt;0.8*\n      &lt;4 mg/kg per 24 hours (&lt;0.1 mmol/kg per 24 hours)\n    \n    \n       \n      7 to 12 months\n      &lt;0.6*\n       \n    \n    \n       \n      &gt;2 years\n      &lt;0.2*\n       \n    \n    \n      Oxalate\n      0 to 6 months\n      &lt;0.26*\n      &lt;40 mg/1.73 m² per 24 hours (&lt;0.5 mmol/1.73 m² per 24 hours)\n    \n    \n       \n      7 to 24 months\n      &lt;0.11*\n       \n    \n    \n       \n      2 to 5 years\n      &lt;0.08*\n       \n    \n    \n       \n      5 to 14 years\n      &lt;0.06*\n       \n    \n    \n       \n      &gt;16 years\n      &lt;0.32*\n       \n    \n    \n      Cystine\n      &gt; 6 months\n      &lt;0.075*\n      &lt;60 mg/1.73 m² per 24 hours (&lt;250 micromol/1.73 m² per 24 hours)\n    \n    \n      Uric acid\n      &lt;1 year\n      &lt;2.2 (&lt;1.5)\n      &lt;815 mg/1.73 m² per 24 hours (&lt;486 mmol/1.73 m² per 24 hours)\n    \n    \n       \n      1-3 years\n      &lt;1.9 (&lt;1.3)\n       \n    \n    \n       \n      3-5 years\n      &lt;1.5 (&lt;1.0)\n       \n    \n    \n       \n      5-10 years\n      &lt;0.9 (&lt;0.6)\n       \n    \n    \n       \n      &gt;10 years\n      &lt;0.6 (&lt;0.4)\n       \n    \n    \n      Citrate**\n      0 to 5 years\n      &gt;0.2 to 0.42 (&gt;0.12 to 0.25)\n      &gt;310 mg/1.73 m² per 24 hours (&gt;1.6 mmol/1.73 m² per 24 hours) in girls; &gt;365 mg/1.73 m² per 24 hours (&gt;1.9 mmol/1.73 m² per 24 hours) in boys\n    \n    \n       \n      &gt;5 years\n      &gt;0.14 to 0.25 (&gt;0.08 to 0.15)\n       \n    \n    \n      Magnesium\n      &gt; 2 years\n      &gt;0.13*\n      &gt;0.8mg/kg (&gt;0.04 mmol/kg)\n    \n  \n\n\nStone analysis is an important step in the initial evaluation of urolithiasis. The composition of all recovered stone fragments should be analyzed by either infrared spectroscopy or X-ray diffraction, and components exceeding 5% should be reported. This should be done with each passage of stone since composition may differ from the initial presentation. Most stones in the pediatric population are calcium-based.15\n\nMetabolic evaluation is an important component of the overall management of pediatric urolithiasis since a metabolic abnormality is present in up to 90% of children with hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia being the most common etiologies.15,16,17,18 Compared to adults, a predisposing cause for stone formation is found in about 2/3 of children and includes metabolic (33–95%), anatomic (8–32%) and infectious factors (2–24%), alone or in combination.19,20,21,22,23\n\nInitial diagnostic imaging is aimed at detecting the stone, estimating the stone size and its likelihood of passing, and at identifying whether it is obstructing the urinary flow (potential need for surgery). Additionally, imaging is important in diagnosing any structural abnormality of the urinary tract which might cause local urinary stasis, such as primary megaureter, medullary sponge disease, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, ureterocele, horseshoe kidney, bladder exstrophy, neuropathic bladder, and surgically reconstructed or augmented bladders. Ultrasonography and a plain abdominal radiograph showing kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) are the mainstay of initial radiological imaging in children.24,25 Ultrasonography (US) is an easy test with a high sensitivity of 77–90% and a specificity of 88–94%.26 It has the advantages of being a painless test without the risk of radiation or need of anesthesia. US reveals the anatomy of the kidneys and the urinary tract and is important in detecting hydronephrosis. Additionally, stones of all compositions should be visualized by US. The cost is low, and the study can be repeated as many times as needed. However, US is operator dependent, overestimates stone size, can miss ureteral calculi, papillary or calyceal stones, and small calculi (&lt;5 mm), and stone visualization can be affected by the patient’s body habitus and bowel gas. Simultaneous KUB should be performed to identify ureteral stones and to appreciate the calcium content of the stone. Computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast is used sparingly in the initial evaluation of urolithiasis in children due to its high risk of radiation and the potential need for sedation. However, low radiation dose, non-contrast CT scan protocols have been developed for pediatric patients and are mainly indicated when the patient is symptomatic and when the stones are suspected but not seen by ultrasound. CT has high sensitivity and specificity 90–100%, and the advantages of providing anatomic details of the kidney and urinary tract, as well as of detecting small and radiolucent stones.\n\nAcute Management\n\nThe immediate treatment goals during an acute stone episode are pain relief, nausea and vomiting control, rehydration, and treatment of associated infection. For most patients, this is usually managed as an outpatient. Pain control can be achieved with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (if renal function and hydration are adequate) or with oral or intravenous narcotics (e.g., morphine 0.3 mg/kg PO every 3–4 hours or 0.05 mg/kg IV every 2–4 hours). The preferred antiemetic agent is ondansetron due to its minimal side effects; metoclopramide hydrochloride or prochlorperazine are acceptable options.\n\nWith adequate pain control, uncomplicated unilateral stones causing only minimal or partial obstruction can be managed conservatively for several weeks before surgical intervention is considered. Stones up to 5 mm have a high likelihood of spontaneous passage in children of all ages. Medical expulsive therapy (MET) for smaller ureteral stones has been used, especially in older children, with some success. The most used agent is tamsulosin, which causes relaxation of ureteral smooth muscle with inhibition of ureteral spasm and dilatation of the ureter. Alternatively, alpha blockers or calcium channel blockers can be used to facilitate the passage of ureteral stones under 10 mm in size.27,28,29,30,31 During an acute episode, all stone patients should be asked to filter urine through a sieve to capture stones for analysis.\n\nThe indications for hospitalization include urgent need for upper tract decompression (nephrostomy tube or an indwelling stent), severe vomiting requiring intravenous hydration, severe pain requiring intravenous analgesia, and urosepsis/acute pyelonephritis requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy.\n\nMetabolic Work Up and Evaluation for Risk of Recurrent Urolithiasis\n\nFollowing the initial presentation and acute management, children with urolithiasis should be referred to a specialized multidisciplinary stone clinic for treatment and further evaluation of the risk factors that might predispose to recurrence of stone. The prevention of recurrence is particularly important in pediatrics due to the high risk of recurrent renal stones in children that reaches up to 50% within 3 years from the first episode of urolithiasis.32 The rate of recurrence is higher in those with an identifiable metabolic abnormality and those with a positive family history of stones in first-degree relatives.22 Additionally, recurrent stone-formers have a two times higher risk of developing CKD and ESRD compared to non-stone formers.33 Ideally, a combined “stone clinic” should provide nephrologic and urologic expertise, genetic testing, dietary services, and appropriate metabolic laboratory investigation.\n\nBasic metabolic panel testing and 24-hour urine analysis should be repeated. Blood levels of parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D are additional tests required in patients with calcium-based stones and when abnormal blood levels of calcium and/or phosphorus are identified. Primary hyperparathyroidism is rare in children, but evidence for suppression of PTH offers a clue to states of vitamin D excess. Moreover, uric acid stones work up should include serum uric acid levels and enzyme assays to check if hyperuricosuria is due to enzyme deficiencies.34 Measurement of blood level oxalate is important in hyperoxaluria to identify the primary types of the disease. The measurement of 24-hour urinary parameters is particularly vital in identifying children who will need pharmacological treatment following their initial stone event.\n\nGenetic testing should be part of the work-up of pediatric patient presenting with urolithiasis in several circumstances: 1, young age at presentation and strong family history of stone disease, as well as consanguineous marriages; 2, failure to thrive and developmental delay, abnormal features, vision and hearing impairment, rickets; 3, high serum creatinine at presentation; 4, development of recurrent stones in spite of treatment; 5, presence of rare tubulopathies; 6, stone composition (cysteine, uric acid, dihydroadenine, xanthine). Early recognition of the monogenic forms of nephrolithiasis (such as primary hyperoxalurias, cystinuria, dRTA, Dent’s disease, Bartter syndrome, Adenine phosphoribosyl transferase deficiency) will allow early treatment and prevention of various complications including irreversible kidney damage.\n\nSurveillance\n\nRepeat metabolic assessment and renal ultrasound are needed to diagnose stone recurrence or increasing size of previous stones. The frequency of these tests depends on the presence and severity of the metabolic abnormality, the number of stones and recurrence rate. A child with a single stone and no evidence of an underlying metabolic abnormality will require less frequent monitoring than a child with multiple stones and a significant metabolic problem known to be at greater risk for recurrent nephrolithiasis (primary hyperoxaluria or cystinuria). Compliance with high fluid intake should be monitored by measuring the urine specific gravity. Children receiving drug therapy should be closely monitored for adverse effects.\n\nIn an asymptomatic child, repeat ultrasonography is usually performed six months after the initial episode. If the ultrasound shows no stone recurrence or change in residual stone size, the study can be performed yearly. Metabolic work-up is repeated four to six weeks after therapy has been initiated. If the metabolic abnormality was corrected, repeat studies should be done at six months, and then yearly. Re-evaluation is needed if metabolic abnormalities persist.\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment of urolithiasis includes dietary modification and pharmacological intervention.\n\nDietary Modification\n\nGeneral dietary recommendation in all children with urolithiasis regardless of etiology include high fluid consumption, salt restriction, and increased intake of vegetables and fruit (Table 2).35,36 Aggressive fluid intake that is evenly distributed throughout the day is aimed to prevent tubular precipitation of various salts. Adequate hydration can be estimated from the urine specific gravity and/or urine osmolality. Water should be encouraged because the fructose found in sweet beverages could cause an increase in the urinary excretion of calcium and oxalate enhancing the risk of stone. Furthermore, sugary drinks will cause weight gain, an undesired effect in overweight children. Fruit and vegetables represent a good source of potassium which facilitates urinary citrate excretion, and a good source of phytates which increase the solubility of calcium salt. High fiber diet facilitates binding of intestinal calcium.\n\nTable 2 General dietary recommendation in pediatric urolithiasis.**\n\n\n  \n    \n      Recommendation\n      Details\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Fluid intake\n      High at &gt;2 L / 1.73 m²/day, mainly water\n    \n    \n      Salt intake\n      Low at &lt;3 mEq/kg/day\n    \n    \n      Vegetables and fruit intake\n      High\n    \n    \n      Calcium intake\n      100% of the daily allowance\n    \n    \n      Protein intake\n      100% of the daily allowance\n    \n    \n      Vitamin D intake\n      Supplement if low\n    \n    \n      Vitamin C intake\n      Avoid excess\n    \n  \n\n\nExcessive salt intake causes increased excretion of urinary calcium, and sodium restriction is advised in all stone-formers. Patients should be advised to avoid adding salt or sodium-rich seasoning to food either during preparation or during consumption. Families should be educated to read food labels before purchasing, and to choose foods low in sodium (increased in ingredients such as sodium nitrate, monosodium glutamate, sodium bicarbonate and sodium phosphate). High-salt foods such as processed and canned food, fast food, pickles and olives, salt crackers and pizza, should be avoided.\n\nRestriction of calcium and protein intake is not recommended in children because they are necessary for growth and bone health. Additionally, calcium binds to free oxalate in the digestive tract and prevents hyperoxaluria. Avoiding high oxalate foods (such as chocolate, spinach, nuts, cola) is particularly important in children with secondary hyperoxaluria, while patients with hyperuricosuria should be advised low intake of purine-containing food (such as red meat).23\n\nPharmacological Therapy\n\nTargeted pharmacological therapies based on the identified metabolic risk factor(s) is presented in Table 3.\n\nUrinary alkalinization with oral potassium citrate to achieve a pH &gt;7.0 is useful in patients with distal RTA /hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, hypocitraturia, and cystinuria because it increases the solubility of these solutes.37,38,39 The recommended dose is 0.5 to 1 mmol/kg/day in divided doses which effectively and safely decreases urinary calcium without significant adverse effects. Potassium citrate therapy should be taken after a meal or with a snack and with a big glass of water to prevent stomach pain which could cause poor therapy adherence. Urinary pH should be closely monitored since a higher pH may decrease the solubility of phosphate leading to calcium phosphate urolithiasis. Additionally, serum K and bicarbonate should be measured periodically. Another treatment option for urinary alkalinization is high lemon extract intake (“Lemon Protocol”) but there are no studies to prove its efficiency in pediatrics and it may not be well tolerated in children leading to non-compliance.40\n\nThiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalodine) have a good effect on reducing the urinary calcium excretion in children by causing volume contraction that increases calcium absorption in the proximal tubule.41,42 The starting dose is 0.5–1 mg/kg/day as a single dose, titrated to achieve maximum efficacy and good tolerance. Close laboratory monitoring is required since may cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia or hyperuricemia. Long-term non-adherence is reported in about one third of patients and hypercalciuria recurs in 44%.43\n\nChildren with cystinuria should undergo aggressive hydration, low salt intake, limited animal protein diet, and urinary alkalinization. In many cases these measures are insufficient and a cystine-binding thiol containing medication (d-penicillamine, tiopronin, and captopril) is needed. Both d-penicillamine and tiopronin act by cleaving the disulfide bond of cystine to produce two cysteine molecules. Both drugs are equally effective and have similar results. Due to potential significant adverse effects, each drug should be started at a lower dose and should be gradually increased based on urinary cystine concentration over several weeks. The targeted goal is a urinary cystine concentration of less than 1,250 micromol/l.44 Close dose monitoring for both efficacy and toxicity is required, with the goal of effectively reducing urinary cystine levels, while minimizing side effects.\n\nTable 3 Pharmacologic intervention in pediatric urolithiasis. *Calcium supplements can be prescribed because calcium binds to oxalate in the intestinal tract forming calcium-oxalate complex that is excreted in the feces.

        "title": "Future Developments in Stone Management",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe past two decades have seen a dramatic rise in pediatric kidney stone incidence, with adolescents representing the fasting growing age demographic across the lifespan of this disease.1 Because children and young adults face unique challenges in terms of care delivery, risks of treatment, and underlying disease processes, advances in kidney stone disease in terms of miniaturization of equipment, reducing ionizing radiation exposure, and improving care for patients with genetic predisposition for urinary stone disease may preferentially benefit pediatric patients. This chapter will review advances not only in surgical equipment but also diagnostics, therapeutics, and care delivery.\n\nDiagnosis and Initial Evaluation\n\nWhile ultrasound (US) remains the preferred first-line imaging strategy for most children with suspected nephrolithiasis, this imaging modality has limitations in terms of both operator dependence, availability, and accuracy.2,3 Meanwhile, computed tomography (CT) is the gold-standard imaging modality for diagnostic accuracy but carries high risks of ionizing radiation exposure, risks that are further compounded in the pediatric population.4 Innovations within the sphere of diagnostic imaging include enhancing US accuracy, reducing CT-based radiation exposure, and enhancing additional functionality such as stone propulsion.\n\nUS Accuracy\n\nUS relies upon sonographic properties at the stone-urine interface to produce the classic image of an echogenic focus on B-mode US. Additionally, deflection of the acoustic waves at the echogenic foci can produce a posterior acoustic shadow while application of Doppler settings can create a twinkle artifact over the stone.5 Both techniques can improve upon the accuracy of US imaging.6 Furthermore, the posterior acoustic shadow has the potential to provide a more accurate size estimate of the urinary calculus.7 However, at present imaging modalities to capture and enhance these findings are not well standardized nor is the identification and reporting of these measures standardized in any way and further evaluations to optimize present technologies and understanding of US findings are needed. Beyond optimization of current imaging technologies, modifications in the acoustic properties of the ultrasonic equipment may produce more distinct imaging characteristics of urinary stones. One such example, currently used on a research platform, is Stone-Mode (i.e., “S-mode™”) ultrasonic imaging. S-mode™ imaging relies on a high frequency transducer to optimize the visual interface between the stone and surrounding tissue and enhance the appearance of the acoustic shadow. Use of post-processing algorithms which tend to blur the images between the dense stone and posterior shadow are minimized, resulting in a sharper image of the calculus at a trade-off of diminished soft-tissue imaging.8\n\nLow Dose CT Scans\n\nAlthough enhancing US imaging is attractive to minimize ionizing radiation in children with nephrolithiasis, CT will likely remain a key imaging modality in the diagnoses of nephrolithiasis for years to come. Several facets of current stone-protocol CT algorithms, such as tube current, tube voltage, and gantry time, may be reduced in order to lower ionizing radiation dose during these studies.9 While low dose CT could hardly be classified as a “future technology,” given the vast amount of literature currently supporting its use, clearly the future of stone management could be improved by enhance the uptake of this technology.10 In this sense, the focus for low dose CT should be in strategies to improve provider education and decision-support incorporated into the electronic health record. Similar strategies have been utilized to produce sustainable radiation-stewardship practices within pediatric emergency departments.11\n\nImaging Propulsion\n\nThe use of ultrasonic propulsion in kidney stone disease was first reported in human trials in 2016.12,13 This technology, which harnesses focused acoustic energy via a transcutaneous probe, is able to propel kidney stone within the renal collecting system (Figure 1). Applications of this technology include repositioning obstructive kidney stones away from the ureteropelvic junction, repositioning stones into a more favorable treatment location (i.e., lower to upper pole), distinguishing between a small cluster of calculi and a dominant large calculus, and encouraging the passage of smaller fragments post-treatment. Human feasibility trials noted stone movement in 14 out of 15 individuals, including one who reported immediate relief upon repositioning of a partially obstructing calculus.12 Intra-operative use of this technology confirmed movement of calculi visually during ureteroscopy, confirming a proof-of-principle approach to repositioning calculi for easier endoscopic treatment.14 Although this technology has not, as the time of this writing, been applied in pediatric patients, the lack of ionizing radiation and opportunities to improve both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches make this an attractive future technology in the space of pediatric nephrolithiasis.\n\n\nFigure 1 Real-time ureteroscopic image of in vivo propulsion of a 7 mm calyceal calculus via extracorporeal propulsion.

Genetic testing is not required for the diagnosis of certain monogenic kidney stone diseases with pathognomonic calculi (i.e., cystinuria or adenine phosphoribosyltrasnferase).15 However, genetic testing has been shown to detect potential monogenic sources of kidney stone disease in up to 20% of children referred to a tertiary kidney stone center.16 Practical issues surrounding the diagnostic strategy of genetic testing include the actionable information to be used based on the testing results and interpretation of variances of uncertain significance. In regards to the former issue, many genes on the most-reference multi-gene panels (often &gt; 30) manifest in a multi-system manner, so that the diagnosis may be suspected, if not known, prior to genetic testing. Furthermore, in the majority of these monogenic kidney stone diseases, a focused treatment does not exist and is mostly driven by the clinical context. Nonetheless, early detection diseases such as primary hyperoxaluria may warrant testing in scenarios where the index of suspicion is high, such as younger patients or those with a strong family history of nephrolithiasis.17 Notably, approximately one-third of reported mutations are novel, raising both questions surrounding the pathological implications of these variances of uncertain significance as well as the potential to further expand upon the knowledge of genetically-based kidney stone disease. In such cases, bioinformatics analysis including software modeling to predict protein structure and potential pathology may inform interpretations of uncertain results.18 In summary, genetic evaluations may be useful especially when evaluating for potentially treatable sources of monogenic stone disease in high-risk populations, and collaboration with geneticists can prove invaluable when managing variances of uncertain significance or counseling.\n\nPrevention\n\nReminder Technologies\n\nIrrespective of novel therapeutic development for secondary kidney stone prevention, dietary and fluid intake measures remain the mainstays of preventative strategies.19 However, clinicians and patients alike recognize challenges to adherence to these recommendations, especially to high volumes of fluid intake daily. Several novel technologies, such as “smart” water bottles with the ability to send just-in-time electronic alerts to families, have been proposed as tools to improve fluid intake. Notably, only 20% adolescents provided with this technology still only met their fluid intake goals over the majority of a week-long study period.20 Other authors have trialed smart-phone applications and/or wearable technology to improve fluid intake experiences with mixed results.21,22 One promising avenue to enhance reminder technologies is the use of behavioral coaching, which is currently being explored in the Prevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) trial. As of this writing, the PUSH trial had finalized accrual but results were pending.23 Notably, there is an adolescent arm to the study, providing potential investigation in the pediatric experience, specifically. While the true value and impact of reminder technologies to improve adherence to secondary prevention of kidney stones remains elusive, one should consider that use of these technologies may still evolve in terms of format or interface while generational changes in technological uptake may further expand opportunities to leverage such innovations.\n\nMedical Prevention\n\nThe most exciting advances in medical prevention for kidney stone disease include novel therapeutics in the form of targeted therapies as well as innovative avenues of pharmaceutical impact. The recent Food and Drug Association approval of lumasiran for Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 marks a landmark advancement as both the first targeted therapy for this disease as well as the first RNAi drug to be approved for use in nephro-urological disease.24 The medication targets messenger RNA encoding for glycolate oxidase, thereby inhibiting the conversion of glycolate to oxalate. It is administered subcutaneously every 1–3 months and has been approved for across the spectrum of the pediatric population, with weight-based dosing indicated for younger children, with those patients weighing less than 10 kilograms receiving monthly injections after a loading sequence and those heavier than 10 kilograms receiving injections every three months. Common side effects include injection site reactions (20%) and abdominal pain (15%), although few participants in the trials withdrew due to side effects.\n\nSurgical Management\n\nAmongst the multitude of recent advancements in the surgical management of urologic stone disease, several are particularly relevant for pediatric patients. Smaller body habitus, including the ureter itself, and susceptibility to radiation exposure are just some of the aspects of pediatric stone disease that differ from treatment in adult patients. New laser technologies have sought to decrease stone retropulsion and increase ablation rate, potentially leading to shorter operative times for pediatric ureteroscopy (URS). Miniaturized instrumentation for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) may result in less morbidity and bleeding for pediatric patients. Furthermore, burst wave lithotripsy is a new technology that offers treatment for stone disease in the office setting, sparing children anesthesia and more difficult recovery.\n\nAdvances in Laser Technology\n\nThere have been several recent advances in laser technology including optimizations of the mainstay for laser lithotripsy, the holmium:YAG system, as well as a new thulium fiber laser (TFL) showing early promising results. Newer advances in holmium laser technology offer less movement of targeted stones during laser fragmentation and the ability to deliver more energy while the TFL offers similar benefits and in addition may allow for smaller laser fibers.\n\nHolmium:YAG Modifications\n\nThe holmium:YAG system has been the gold standard for laser lithotripsy since its introduction, due to ease of use and favorable safety profile.25 Newer Moses and long pulse modifications of this technology alter this single, fixed pulse length approach. Long pulse modes deliver the same amount of energy over a longer time period, typically ranging from 500–1000 µs, reducing retropulsion at the expense of decreased energy delivery.26,27,28,29 The Moses effect describes a physical phenomenon that occurs when a holmium laser is fired in a fluid medium (Figure 2). This emitted energy is highly absorbed in water leading to the formation of a vapor tunnel. In a standard single pulse from a holmium laser, this energy transfer fails to reach the stone interface. Moses technology allows for energy to be delivered in two pulses; the first pulse delivers a small amount of energy causing a vapor channel to form while the second pulse delivers the majority of the energy that can now travel through the formed vapor channel to the target calculus.26 Moses technology has been shown to decrease operating time in the clinical setting due to decreased retropulsion and increased stone fragmentation efficiency.30,31\n\n\nFigure 2 Standard and Moses holmium:YAG laser waveforms.\n\nThulium Fiber\n\nTFL generates a laser beam more efficiently than holmium:YAG, relying on a diode laser that emits light within the absorption peak of thulium ions thereby exciting thulium ions within a thin silicon fiber with minimal loss of energy as heat, allowing for higher frequency ranges and broader ranges of pulse energy.25,32 Example settings used in the fragmentation of a renal stone as well as the TFL generator can be seen in Figure 3. Smaller laser fibers, as small as 150 µm and 50 µm in in vitro development, allow for improved irrigation flow and the potential to further miniaturize ureteroscopes.33 The TFL emits light at a wavelength of 1940 nm, even closer to water’s absorption peak of 1910 nm than the light emitted by holmium:YAG lasers. This leads to a favorable safety profile as the depth of penetration is reduced.34\n\n\nFigure 3 Example settings of TFL, utilized for treatment of a renal calculus (example shown here during adult lithotripsy).\n\nMultiple in vitro studies suggest that the TFL can produce faster ablation rates and potentially better stone clearance than the holmium:YAG system.35,36 However, there is some debate if these differences are clinically significant. Jaeger et al compared TFL to holmium:YAG during URS among 125 pediatric patients, 32 of which were treated with TFL. Patients treated with a TFL were less likely to have a retained stone fragment with no significant difference in operative time or complication rate, albeit with a longer lasering time in the TFL group.37 A meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults including nearly 1,700 patients showed several advantages with TFL as compared to holmium:YAG, including better operative times, laser utilization times, retropulsion, and stone clearance. There were no differences in ablation efficiency, total energy usage or hospital stay.38\n\nDue to both the emitted energy being so similar to the absorption peak of water and the ability to operate at higher power and frequency settings heat and thermal injury are of greater concern with the TFL than with a holmium laser. Furthermore, simulated models have demonstrated that younger patients with smaller kidneys may be more susceptible to thermal injury during ureteroscopy for renal stones. However, these effects may be mitigated with the use of an access sheath and continuous pressurized irrigation39\n\nMiniaturization of PCNL\n\nEarly experience with PCNL in pediatric patients was complicated by higher bleeding rates and a larger proportion of patients needing blood transfusions after their procedures due to the use of larger, adult sized instruments (up to 30 Fr).40,41 There have been significant advances in miniaturizing the instruments needed to perform PCNL; this has led to increased utilization of PCNL in the pediatric population with lower complication rates.42 Mini-PCNL was first described in 1998 by Jackman et al in an attempt to develop a less invasive PCNL technique that would decrease morbidity in young children.42 Notably, this innovation initially described in children has taken hold amongst the adult population as well.\n\nFurther efforts to miniaturize PCNL have resulted in ultra-mini PCNL (UMP) (11–13 Fr) and micro-PCNL (4.8 Fr). UMP can be accomplished with either a nephroscope or ureteroscope utilizing laser fragmentation and has shown equivalent stone clearance to mini-PCNL with longer operative times.43,44 Micro-PCNL represents the smallest access tract currently reported for miniaturized PCNL procedures, using an “all-seeing needle” which measures 4.85 Fr and has a lumen that can accommodate a 200 micron laser fiber.45 It is important to note that this technique does not allow for significant removal of stone fragments directly through the access tract.\n\nThere are multiple advantages to reducing the instrumentation size in PCNL including: decreased bleeding, decreased trauma to renal parenchyma and decreased pain related to the access tract. A recent systematic review sought to evaluate the efficacy and complications of minimally invasive PCNL techniques in pediatric patients.46 A total of 14 studies including 456 patients who underwent micro-PCNL or UMP were included. Mean stone size ranged from 12 to 16.5 mm. The stone free rate ranged from 80–100% and complications were seen in 14% of patients. 77% of complications were Clavien-Dindo grade I or II. Complications included hematuria, fever, urine leak, UTI, need for transfusion and 3 patients with renal pelvic perforation. Overall, the transfusion rate in this systematic review was 2.1%. Minimally invasive PCNL has proven to be safe for pediatric patients. However, there are some disadvantages including decreased visual clarity and inability to remove stones through the access tract for micro-PCNL. There has been some evidence of an increase in intra-renal pressure in mini-PCNL as well.47 With an increasing range in options for the surgical management of pediatric renal stone disease UMP and micro-PCNL represent an attractive option that should be considered in patients with a moderate renal stone burden.\n\nAdvances in Ultrasonic Stone Fragmentation: Burst Wave Lithotripsy\n\nAlthough historically, SWL has been used as a first line therapy to fragment stones in the pediatric population the procedure requires general anesthesia and with more recent advances in endoscopic techniques has fallen out of favor in many situations: particularly in patients with larger stone burdens, harder stone compositions, increased skin to stone distance and stone disease in the lower pole of the kidney.48 SWL involves delivering single cycle of energy at a slow rate (0.5–3 Hz) to fragment stones. Burst wave lithotripsy (BWL) is a relatively new modality being explored that uses multicycle sinusoidal bursts of focused ultrasound pulses to fracture stones rather than the single compression/tension cycle created by SWL (Figure 4). BWL offers a potential therapy that could be used in an office setting or sedation room without the need for general anesthesia, which would be an attractive option for many pediatric patients.13\n\n\nFigure 4 Simulation of burst wave lithotripsy (BWL) across a calculus interface. Top image shows the yellow and blue-green pressure waves moving across the stone, with 5-fold central stress amplification within the calculus due to the multiple pulse cycles of BWL. Bottom image demonstrates an exaggerated image of stress-induced stone distortion owing to the stress amplification previously described. Image courtesy of Oleg Sapozhnikov at University of Washington.\n\nThere are several important differences in the properties generated by BWL when compared with traditional SWL. For SWL an approximately 5 µs pulse repeats every 0.33 to 2 seconds resulting in 180 shockwaves per minute. BWL is delivered using 10–100 cycles at a time and has been investigated at a range of 300–500 kHz in humans.13 The peak amplitude of an SWL wave form is approximately 10-fold greater than BWL. However, BWL can deliver the same amount of energy due to using so many more cycles than the single SWL pulse of energy. Furthermore, while SWL creates a cloud cavitation in a focal area that can cause tissue injury, BWL there is milder growth of cavitation bubbles. Bubble clouds are more diffuse and do not typically undergo violent collapse, potentially minimizing cellular damage.49 Although there is some evidence that the more diffuse bubble clouds generated in BWL can lead to shielding of the targeted stone from subsequent pulses, BWL may overcome this limitation by scaling the delivery of energy.50 One model showed that using specific frequencies for different stone sizes can amplify the internal stress in a stone generated by BWL, an option not available in standard SWL.51\n\nThere is limited data on the use of BWL in the clinical setting, and it should be noted that this treatment has not yet been studied in children.52 Current clinical experiences are summarized in Table 1. The largest currently reported trial, of 19 patients, treated stones &lt; 12 mm for up to 10 minutes with BWL. A median of 90% of stone volume was completely comminuted in 10 minutes and 39% of stone targets were fragmented with all pieces &lt;2 mm within 10 minutes.53 Another study treated 13 awake and unanesthetized patients with both ultrasonic propulsion and BWL, with 70% reported stone clearance and a mean pain score of 1.2/10 during treatment.54\n\nTable 1 Summary of PubMed search for burst wave lithotripsy evaluations in human trials.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Year\n      Author\n      Title\n      Key Results\n       \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      2021\n      Harper\n      First In-Human Burst Wave Lithotripsy for Kidney Stone Comminution: Initial Two Case Studies54\n      Patient A had successful BWL for renal stone observed via URS.

However, these technologies must be further understood in terms of most effective clinical use, questions which are ripe for comparative effectiveness research. Other technological advances, such as imaging propulsion and BWL, remain on the horizon of management yet offer promising roads to treatments in children within the next several decades.\n\nReferences\n\n\nTasian GE, Ross ME, Song L, Sas DJ, Keren R, Denburg MR, et al..

        "title": "Renal Trauma",
        "content": "By M. Al-Salihi &amp; S. Vallasciani\n\nIntroduction\n\nRenal injury is considered one of the most common urinary tract injuries encountered in both blunt and penetrating trauma. The majority are blunt injuries, with less than 10% being penetrating. Children have a higher risk of blunt renal injuries than adults due to less supportive perinephric fat, and the thoracic ribs are more pliable, which lets the force of trauma transfer to the solid organs.\n\nRenal trauma rarely occurs as an isolated injury and is more commonly associated with other solid organs or part of polytrauma. Renal trauma is divided into 5 grades according to its severity, with most of the injuries being of low grades.\n\nAnatomy\n\nIt is essential to understand the anatomy of the kidney when diagnosing, grading, and to manage renal injury. Each kidney is located within the Gerota's fascia surrounding the renal space and is filled with the perirenal fat. It acts as a protecting cushion to the kidney and is less represented in children.\n\nComposition of the renal hilum from anterior to posterior, see the renal vein as the most anterior, followed by the renal artery, and the ureter is the most posterior structure.\n\nThe right renal vein is usually shorter because of its proximity to the inferior vena cava. Both gonadal and adrenal veins drain directly to the inferior vena cava on the right side. In contrast, on the left, the renal vein is usually longer and receives both gonadal and adrenal veins from the left side.\n\nEach renal artery comes directly from the aorta, divided into five branches: apical, superior, middle, lower, and posterior. Occasionally, accessory branches come directly from the aorta.\n\nSigns suggestive of renal trauma:\n\n\n  Hematuria\n  Flank ecchymosis\n  Penetrating injury in the region\n  Fractured ribs (especially lower ribs)\n  Abdominal mass\n  Abdominal tenderness\n\n\nThe concept of “significant hematuria” after trauma is debated in children.1 While some authors consider a cutoff of &gt;5 RBC/HPF; others advocate for &gt;50 RBC/HPF. Hematuria alone, however, is not a reliable marker of renal injury. Moreover, the degree of** hematuria does not correlate with the degree of injury**.\n\nWith this in mind, others recommend investigating any hematuria (microscopic or gross) in any child with blunt abdominal trauma associated with a decelerating mechanism (MVC, pedestrian strike, fall from height).1\n\nDiagnostic Studies\n\nUpon suspicion of renal injury, the ultrasound is the initial tool for management. As stated before, many renal injuries occur in the context of blunt abdominal trauma for whom current protocols include initial imaging as FAST ultrasound scan ,2,3 This ultrasound will give the initial picture that the kidney is possibly being affected by the traumatic event.\n\nOnce the renal trauma is diagnosed, more specific investigations must be performed to evaluate the extent of the involvement of the kidney. Among the armamentarium for the physician, the following can help to determine this.\n\n\n  US (Ultrasound): the US with Doppler can be used for those with very mild trauma and lower suspicion for significant injury but cannot distinguish extravasated urine from blood and cannot accurately image the vascular pedicle.\n  IVP (Intravenous Pyelogram) was widely used in the past and is used nowadays when no Computer Tomography is available. It can be performed either in the trauma room or in the operating theatre. An intravenous contrast of 2 mL/kg is administered, and an x-ray will be taken after 10 minutes. It is helpful to diagnose the functionality of the kidneys and the presence of any extravasation.\n  CT with IV contrast is the current gold standard: It is valid to evaluate the anatomy and functionality of the kidneys and the renovascular system in a time-efficient manner.\n    \n      Ideally, a \"four-phase\" CT with IV contrast images the arterial, nephrographic, and pyelographic phases; however, this is rarely done because of the increased radiation associated with four passes.\n      Standard CT imaging obtains arterial phase and early cortical phase… which may miss some parenchymal or collecting system injuries.1\n      CT findings alone do NOT determine management.4\n    \n  \n  Angiography or intraoperative IV urography are also tools to image in some instances.\n\n\nGrading\n\nThe American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Organ Injury Scale (AAST-OIS) is the most common grading system used for solid organ injuries, including the kidney.5 The grading system is based on the CT scan and operative findings. This grading system is adapted from adults and is still used for pediatric trauma. It is divided into 5 grades: grades 1-2 are considered low grades, while 4-5 are high grades.\n\n\n  Grade I – Contusion or non-expanding subcapsular hematoma\n  Grade II – Perinephric hematoma with parenchymal laceration &lt; 1cm deep\n  Grade III – As Grade II with laceration &gt;1cm in depth. No collecting system is involved.\n  Grade IV – Laceration involving collecting system (perinephric urinoma)\n  Grade V – Parenchymal laceration involving collecting system (shattered kidney) and/or main renal vein/artery laceration or avulsion of the main artery or thrombosis of the renal vein.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 AAST-OIS renal trauma grading system.\n\nPossible Complications\n\n\n  Urinary extravasation (most common complication, particularly with grades IV and V)\n  Urinoma\n    \n      It may present acutely or weeks-months later\n      The usual signs are pain, fever, ileus and a palpable mass\n    \n  \n  Secondary hemorrhage\n    \n      Delayed bleeding, which occurs in 13–25% of Grade III–V injuries\n      Usually seen in the first 2–3 weeks after trauma\n    \n  \n  Perinephric abscess (rare)\n  AV fistula formation (rare and exclusively from stab wounds)\n  Pseudoaneurysm\n  Calyceal diverticula\n  Impaired renal function\n  Hypertension\n\n\nManagement\n\nThe first determinant for the management is the hemodynamic status. The stable patients can proceed to complete investigations for possible conservative (non-operative) management. Hemodynamically unstable patients not responsive to fluid resuscitation should undergo urgent operative management.\n\nIn an alert and communicative child with minimal symptoms and no concerning physical findings which have &lt;50 RBC/HPF, observation or screening U/S with Doppler rather than obtaining a CT simply for evaluation of kidneys may be reasonable.1\n\nOnce the kidney damage secondary to the trauma is diagnosed, it is recommended to establish complete urine drainage at low pressures. A simple transurethral catheter in the bladder as an initial measure only is the simplest and most effective (and sometimes the only needed).\n\nOverall, renal trauma in children is managed conservatively, even with higher-grade injuries.1,4,6 Specifically, all Grade I–III injuries can be managed non-operatively.7 There is evidence that Grade IV and V can be managed conservatively, too.4 These higher-grade injuries require a careful, tailored approach to each individual.1 This is particularly relevant in pediatric patients where Grade IV injuries are a heterogeneous population.3\n\n\nFigure 2 Example patient with Grade IV renal trauma at initial presentation, after 1 month, and after 8 months.\n\nOne must always keep in mind that The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grading system is not perfect and leads to controversies.6 The reason is that this grading system is based predominantly on the adult population and may not adequately reflect the pediatric population.6 Some further subdivide Grade IV for this reason.\n\nSurgery is recommended for:1\n\n\n  Hemodynamically UNSTABLE patients\n  Those with severe intra-abdominal PENETRATING injuries.\n\n\nSurgery or interventional radiology may be required for:1\n\n\n  Massive urinary extravasation in Grades IV–V\n  Extensive (&gt;20%) nonviable tissue\n  Arterial injury\n  Incomplete staging\n\n\nWhatever the initial grading, if observation management is established, continued patient monitoring is recommended to assess whether it can present delayed damage to the kidney. Any change in vital signs and/or new onset of hematuria should be promptly reassessed by imaging.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Do not overlook the hematuria! Not everyone needs a CT scan, in any case!\n  Know the limitations of your imaging! You cannot see what you do not image\n  Unless hemodynamically unstable, usually all traumas can be managed non-operatively\n  Assess and reassess your patient, clinical picture can be changed\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFernández-Ibieta M.

        "title": "Bladder and Ureteral Trauma",
        "content": "Bladder Trauma\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe incidence of bladder rupture during childhood is low, with the condition representing about 5% of urinary tract injuries. According to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), the majority (92%) of bladder injuries are grade III–IV.1\n\nPelvic fractures are less frequently associated with bladder trauma in children (3–4% of cases) than in adults (70–80%). Another difference compared with adults is that neck lacerations are twice as frequently associated with bladder trauma in children. This fact is of great clinical importance in the diagnosis and subsequent treatment,2,3\n\nAn important factor in these injuries, especially in children, is the degree of bladder distention. A fully distended bladder can rupture even with a mild blow; however, an empty bladder is rarely damaged except by crushing or penetrating injuries. In children undergoing an intermittent catheterization (IC) program associated with bladder enlargements, the bladder is more vulnerable, and perforation is easier.\n\nDue to the high energy necessary to damage the bladder, 60–90% of patients presenting with bladder injury have a pelvic bony fracture while 6–8% of patients with a pelvic fracture will have bladder injury. Pediatric patients are more susceptible to bladder injuries due to the childhood anatomy. A pelvic fracture with hematuria is associated with a bladder injury in 30% of cases.4\n\nWithin abdominal surgery, gynecological and obstetric procedures are the most frequent (52–61%), followed by urological interventions (12–39%) and general surgery (9–26%).\n\nIatrogenic bladder injuries associated with urologic surgery occur during vaginal procedures and laparoscopy. In children undergoing inguinal canal surgery, especially for intra-abdominal cryptorchidism, there may be a risk of bladder injury. During transurethral resection of tumors, the risk is generally low (1%), and most cases (88%) can be treated by drainage with a bladder catheter. Transurethral resection of the prostate is also associated with low injury rates.5\n\nClassification\n\nBladder injuries are mainly of four types: intraperitoneal bladder rupture (IBR), extraperitoneal bladder rupture (EBR), bladder contusion and bladder neck avulsion. IBR occurs in 15–25% of cases. EBR is the most common type, being found in 60–90% of patients, and it is more frequently associated with pelvic fractures. Combined bladder rupture, i.e., a combination of IBR and EBR, is found in 5–12% of cases. EBR can be further classified into simple EBR, where the urinary leak is limited to the extraperitoneal pelvic region, and complex injuries, where extravasated urine infiltrates the anterior abdominal wall, the scrotum, and the perineum.6\n\nIn addition, iatrogenic lesions may arise during open lower abdominal or pelvic surgery (85% of cases) or, less frequently, during vaginal surgery, laparoscopy, or surgery on the inguinal canal. Furthermore, spontaneous lesions are possible. In this type of lesion, the bladder trauma in a healthy child is extremely rare and may go unnoticed in the face of abdominal pain, free intra-abdominal fluid, or sepsis in neonates. Perforations have been described in children with bladder diverticulum and those with bladder enlargement. The global incidence of bladder perforation in children undergoing augmentation cystoplasty is 5%, while after bladder catheterization it is 1%; 4% of cases are spontaneous.7,8,9\n\nExtraperitoneal Bladder Injuries\n\nIn these cases, urine leakage is limited to the perivesical space. Most occur because of closed trauma and in relation to fractures of the pelvic bone frame. They can also occur in pelvic disjunctions when the bladder wall is torn by traction on the pubovesical ligaments.\n\nIntraperitoneal Bladder Injuries\n\nIn these cases, the peritoneal surface is broken. Such injuries. Twenty-five percent occur in patients without pelvic fractures. In children, they are more frequent than extraperitoneal injuries, and in this age group they represent 77% of bladder injuries. Their incidence may have increased due to the progressive rise in use of the seat belt.\n\nThe lesion occurs more frequently in the posterior wall of the bladder and in the bladder dome, which is the place of least resistance. Another factor that favors the latter site is the lack of bone protection, which is why it is more exposed to possible traumatic agents, especially during filling,10,11\n\nDiagnosis\n\nTaking a clinical history is essential, and the same data must be collected as in any polytraumatized patient. In the event of pelvic fractures, the history should be directed toward potential bladder injury.\n\nClinical Manifestations\n\nThe clinical manifestations can be very diverse, depending on the intensity of the trauma, whether it is penetrating or not, whether the rupture is intra- or extraperitoneal, and the associated injuries. It is important to suspect such injuries in patients with pelvic fractures and to prevent them from going unnoticed, which will lead to a delay in diagnosis.\n\nThe most frequent symptoms in patients with significant bladder injuries are macroscopic hematuria and abdominal pain, and difficulty in urination may also occur.\n\nMacroscopic Hematuria\n\nThere is a close correlation between traumatic bladder rupture, pelvic fracture, and macroscopic hematuria in 85%. Sometimes urethrorrhagia is present, which is important to consider for diagnostic maneuvers (cystography) since the urethra can be injured.\n\nAbsence of hematuria does not rule out bladder rupture: 2–10% of patients with a bladder rupture present only microhematuria or no hematuria at all (15.-17).\n\nAbdominal Pain\n\nThis is the most common symptom after hematuria. Patients with extraperitoneal lesions tend to present diffuse abdominal pain in the hypogastrium, whereas those with intraperitoneal lesions often report pain at the level of the shoulders and in the center of the back due to accumulation of urine in the abdominal cavity and below the diaphragm. The latter patients can go for hours without having the desire to urinate due to the extravasation of urine into the abdominal cavity. With this in mind, one needs to consider the possibility of bladder rupture in patients with abdominal pain without an obvious cause, and especially in those who have undergone augmentation cystoplasty and those with bladder exstrophy, bladder diverticula, or inflammatory processes of the bladder. Delay in diagnosis can lead to serious complications.\n\nUrinary Retention\n\nAbsence of micturition without a bladder catheter and, if necessary, other causes such as prerenal anuria or upper urinary tract injury must be ruled out.\n\nHematomas in the Suprapubic Region, Genitalia, or Perineum\n\nUrine extravasation can cause swelling in the perineum, scrotum, and thighs, as well as along the abdominal wall, between the transversalis fascia and the parietal peritoneum.\n\nImaging Studies\n\nAbsolute indications for bladder imaging after abdominal trauma are limited to macroscopic hematuria associated with a pelvic fracture. The relative indications for imaging after blunt abdominal trauma are bladder clots, perineal hematoma, and a history of bladder enlargement. In patients with open bladder injuries, imaging studies should be obtained whenever there is suspicion that the bladder has been injured or free peritoneal fluid is observed on the initial computed tomography (CT).12,13,6\n\nRetrograde Cystography\n\nRetrograde cystography represents the diagnostic procedure of choice in bladder injuries and should always be performed in hemodynamically stable or stabilized patients with suspected bladder injury. CT cystography has displaced conventional cystography for this purpose, and it achieves a 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity.\n\nIntravenous Contrast-Enhanced Ct Scan with Delayed Phase\n\nIntravenous contrast-enhanced CT scan with delayed phase is less sensitive and specific than retrograde cystography in detecting bladder injuries.\n\nDirect Inspection of the Intraperitoneal Bladder\n\nDirect inspection of the intraperitoneal bladder should be performed, whenever feasible during emergency laparotomy in patients with suspected bladder injury. Intravenous dyes such as methylene blue or indigo carmine may facilitate intraoperative investigation.14,15,16\n\nThe association of pelvic fracture and macroscopic hematuria constitutes an absolute indication for immediate cystography in patients with blunt trauma. In contrast, cystography can be omitted in patients with isolated hematuria if there are no physical signs of lower urinary tract injuries.\n\nOne potentially useful imaging method that is not available in all centers, and even less so during emergencies, is urosonography or echocystography. This option has high sensitivity and specificity and avoids the drawbacks of radiation.\n\nThe study is done at the same time as assessment of other abdominal injuries and as the first diagnostic maneuver.17\n\nTreatment\n\nStabilization of the patient and evaluation of the associated injuries are the priorities. Administration of antibiotics is also necessary to avoid infections that could lead to sepsis.\n\nThe surgical treatment of bladder perforations has been and remains a controversial issue.18\n\nExtraperitoneal Injuries\n\nMost extraperitoneal injuries can be treated by urethral catheter drainage. The important thing is to monitor the operation of the probe to avoid obstruction; if obstruction does occur, careful washing must be carried out. An efficient approach to avoid obstruction is to place a triple-lumen catheter with continuous irrigation. In children, however, this possibility does not exist, given the caliber of the triple-lumen catheters available on the market; we therefore place a urethrovesical catheter of a caliber that is appropriate to the child’s age and sufficient to allow continuous irrigation, with use of a larger suprapubic catheter for drainage. The catheter can be flushed and aspirated to avoid clogging if necessary Larger-caliber urethral catheters can lead to urethral strictures in the long term.\n\nWith this non-surgical approach, the rate of correction is 90%, and 87% of injuries have resolved at 10 days. It is to be noted that when a bone spicule is observed protruding from the bladder or located inside it, and in the case of neck lacerations, surgical intervention is mandatory.\n\nOne must not forget the association of extraperitoneal injuries with urethral injuries. To exclude the latter, a cystourethrogram should be performed. Surgical treatment is an emergency, with urethrovesical anastomosis protected by perivesical drainage and a urinary catheter.19\n\nIntraperitoneal Injuries\n\nMost closed intraperitoneal injuries are located in the bladder dome. They are often large and sometimes cannot be assessed radiologically.\n\nIn principle, treatment should be conservative, with placement of a urethrovesical catheter for 8–10 days. In the event of persistence of the rupture, infectious complications, or association with other serious injuries, surgery should be considered. Surgical treatment is only justified if urinary bladder drainage is inadequate or prolonged through peritoneal drainage and/or if there is no clinical improvement.\n\nIntraperitoneal bladder injuries occur after a high degree of force, with resultant major bladder rupture. Such injuries are often associated with other abdominal injuries, requiring surgical exploration.\n\nSurgical treatment is more commonly indicated in children because the smaller caliber of the urethral catheters used in children (referred to above) hinders effective urinary output and thus resolution of the injuries, and because there is a greater likelihood of hemodynamic instability.20,21,22\n\nIatrogenic Injuries\n\nMost iatrogenic injuries can occur in the context of any surgical procedure, whether pelvic, abdominal, or vaginal. In these cases, knowledge of the injury becomes available intraoperatively, so it must be corrected at that time.\n\nTreatment Statements\n\n\n  Bladder contusion requires no specific treatment and may be observed clinically.\n  Intraperitoneal bladder rupture should be managed by surgical exploration and primary repair.\n  Laparoscopy may be considered for the repair of isolated intraperitoneal injuries in cases with hemodynamic stability and without other indications for laparotomy.\n  In cases of severe intraperitoneal bladder rupture, during damage control procedures, urinary diversion via bladder and perivesical drainage or external ureteral stenting may be used.\n  Uncomplicated blunt or penetrating extraperitoneal bladder injuries may be managed non-operatively, with urinary drainage via a urethral or suprapubic catheter in the absence of any other indication for laparotomy.\n  Complex extraperitoneal bladder ruptures, i.e., bladder neck injuries, lesions associated with pelvic ring fracture, and/or vaginal or rectal injuries, should be explored and repaired.\n  Surgical repair of extraperitoneal bladder rupture should be considered during laparotomy for other indications and during surgical exploration of the prevesical space for orthopedic fixations.\n  In adult patients, urinary drainage by urethral catheter (without a suprapubic catheter) after surgical management of bladder injuries is mandatory. For pediatric patients, suprapubic cystostomy is recommended.6\n\n\nFollow-Up\n\nBecause the purpose is to close the bladder rupture, the bladder catheter is kept in place for 9–11 days in cases of conservative treatment, while in patients who have undergone surgical correction, 7 days may be sufficient. However, before removal of the bladder catheter, cystography must be performed to check that there is no leakage. If a suprapubic catheter has been used, we first close it and, if there are no problems with urination, then remove it, also assessing whether there is postmicturition residue.22\n\nComplications\n\nComplications are more frequent in cases with a delay in diagnosis and therefore in treatment. The most frequent are hematoma, infections, peritonitis, and sepsis.\n\nUrinary fistulas may occur, and their persistence requires endoscopy. Depending on the result, the treatment will be via endoscopic maneuvers or open surgery.21\n\nUreteral Trauma\n\nEpidemiology and Diagnosis\n\nTraumatic ureteral lesions are rare (less than 1%). The most common cause of ureteral injury is penetrating trauma, especially gunshot wounds; only one-third of cases are caused by blunt trauma. In blunt trauma, ureteral injuries commonly occur at the ureteropelvic junction, especially in children and in high-energy deceleration injuries. Associated organ injuries are common in patients with ureteral lesions. The clinical presentation of ureteral injuries may be subtle but isolated hematuria is a common finding.23\n\nInjury to the ureter should be suspected in patients who have suffered high-energy blunt trauma, particularly in the presence of deceleration injuries with multisystem involvement and cases of penetrating abdominal trauma.24\n\nPerirenal stranding or hematomas, extravasation of contrast into the perirenal space, and presence of low-density retroperitoneal fluid around the genitourinary elements at imaging are indicative of ureteral injuries. Macro- or microscopic hematuria is not a reliable sign of ureteral injury because it is absent in up to 25% of cases. A delay in diagnosis may have a negative impact on outcomes. Ultrasound plays no role in the diagnosis of ureteral injury. At delayed phase CT scan, periureteral hematoma, partial or complete obstruction of the lumen, mild distention of the ureter, hydronephrosis, delayed pyelogram, and lack of contrast in the ureter distal to the injury are all signs suggestive of ureteral injury. Urinary ascites and urinoma are considered subacute/chronic findings. A 10-min delayed phase CT scan represents a valid diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of ureteral and ureteropelvic injuries.25,26\n\nIf CT scan results are unclear, ascending urography represents the method of choice. IVU is an unreliable test (with a false negative rate of up to 60%).27\n\nIf emergency laparotomy is required, direct inspection of the ureter is indicated, and it can be associated with the use of renally excreted intravenous dye (i.e., indigo carmine or methylene blue). Single-shot IVU may be indicated intraoperatively.\n\nSuspicion of ureteral injury is critical in any child with high-intensity abdominal trauma who has multiple concomitant injuries. Also, although traumatic ureteral lesions are rare, any injury caused by penetrating trauma should lead to suspicion of ureteral injury.\n\nCT scan is the best method to diagnose ureteral trauma. Already in the excretory phase, it may not show passage of contrast towards the distal ureter, which may lead to suspicion of ureteral avulsion.\n\nAlthough a retrograde pyelogram is probably the most accurate method to assess ureteral integrity, [it is not practical in an acute trauma setting]{:.text-decoration-underline}.\n\nAn intraoperative evaluation can also be performed by direct inspection of the ureter with the help of methylene blue injection via the urinary route or by parenteral administration of indigo carmine.28,29\n\nTreatment\n\nThe type of treatment depends on appropriate classification of the organ damage, the general condition of the patient, the time since diagnosis, and the location of the injury.\n\nIf the ureteral injury is recognized early, the ureter must be repaired immediately (tension-free anastomosis with spatulation of both ends). If possible, the anastomotic site should also be wrapped with retroperitoneal fat or omentum. Placement of a urinary diversion (nephrostomy or ureteral stent) is recommended.\n\nBecause most ureteral injuries are diagnosed late, immediate repair during abdominal exploration is diagnosed. \"Minimally invasive\" treatments have become increasingly popular in this context. Percutaneous drainage of urinomas and placement of a nephrostomy tube have been shown to be useful in cases of closed and penetrating trauma to the ureter. Ureteral catheterization without open surgery has also been used successfully.\n\nThe management of ureteral contusions does not require active treatment unless there is tissue necrosis, in which case ureteral catheterization and periureteral drainage are indicated.30\n\nPartial ureteral lacerations may be candidates for primary repair or treatment with a ureteral catheter. Management of complete lacerations and avulsions will depend on the amount of lost ureter and its location. If there is an adequate length of healthy ureter, performance of a ureteroureterostomy after wound debridement may be an option. Otherwise, reconstructive surgery is the appropriate choice, and in the case of proximal lesions, transuretero-ureterostomy, autotransplantation, and ureteral replacement with intestine or appendix appear reasonable options.\n\nIf the general condition of the patient precludes immediate repair, a transitory ureterostomy with reconstructive treatment in a second stage is an option that provides good drainage without the presence of tubes.\n\nAvulsions of the ureteropelvic junction should be managed with a primary re-anastomosis if possible. If the ureteral length is inadequate, ureterocalicostomy is a suitable option.30\n\nTreatment Statements\n\n\n  Contusions may require ureteral stenting when urine flow is impaired.\n  Partial lesions of the ureter should initially be treated conservatively with the use of a stent, with or without a diverting nephrostomy, in the absence of other indications for laparotomy.\n  Partial and complete ureteral transections or avulsions unsuitable for non-operative management may be treated with primary repair plus a double J stent or ureteral re-implant into the bladder in the case of distal lesions.\n  Ureteral injuries should be repaired operatively when discovered during laparotomy or in cases in which conservative management has failed.\n  Ureteral stenting should be attempted in cases of partial ureteral injuries diagnosed in a delayed fashion; if this approach fails, and/or in cases of complete transection of the ureter, percutaneous nephrostomy with delayed surgical repair is indicated.\n  In any ureteral repair, stent placement is strongly recommended.24\n\n\nComplications\n\nUrinary extravasation can present as a growing mass on the abdominal flank, with no signs of bleeding. Initial management should include urinary diversion, with the placement of either a double J catheter or a percutaneous nephrostomy tube. If there is already a urinoma and/or abscess, it can be drained percutaneously. Most cases evolve without the formation of ureteral stricture.31\n\n\nFigure 1 Types of bladder and ureteral injuries and their management6,24\n\nTable 1 Guidelines for managing ureteral trauma.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Recommendation\n      Level of evidence\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Contusions may require ureteral stenting when urine flow is impaired.\n      1C\n    \n    \n      Partial lesions of the ureter should initially be treated conservatively with the use of a stent, with or without a diverting nephrostomy in the absence of other indications for laparotomy.\n      1C\n    \n    \n      Partial and complete ureteral transections or avulsions not suitable for non-medical management may be treated with primary repair plus a double J stent or ureteral re-implant into the bladder in the case of distal lesions.\n      1C\n    \n    \n      Ureteral injuries should be repaired operatively when discovered during laparotomy or in cases in which conservative management has failed.\n      1C\n    \n    \n      Ureteral stenting should be attempted in cases of partial ureteral injuries diagnosed in a delayed fashion; if this approach fails, and/or in the case of complete transection of the ureter, percutaneous nephrostomy with delayed surgical repair is indicated.\n      1C\n    \n    \n      In any ureteral repair, stent placement is strongly recommended.\n      1C\n    \n  \n\n\nIn the absence of other indications for laparotomy, the majority of low-grade ureteral injuries (contusion or partial transection) may be managed by observation and/or ureteral stenting. If stenting is unsuccessful, a nephrostomy tube should be placed.\n\nIf ureteral injuries are suspected during a laparotomy, direct visualization of the ureter is mandatory. Whenever possible, ureteral injuries should be repaired. Otherwise, a damage control strategy should be preferred, with ligation of the damaged ureter and urinary diversion (temporary nephrostomy), followed by delayed repair.\n\nIn cases of complete transection of the ureter, surgical repair is indicated. The two main options are primary uretero-ureterostomy or ureteral re-implant with bladder psoas hitch or a Boari flap. The use of ureteral stents is recommended after all surgical repairs to reduce failures (leaks) and strictures. \nDistal injuries to the ureter (caudal to the iliac vessels) are usually treated by reimplantation of the ureter in the bladder (uretero-neocystostomy), as the traumatic insult may jeopardize the blood supply.\n\nIn cases of delayed diagnosis of incomplete ureteral injuries or delayed presentation, an attempt at ureteral stent placement should be done; however, retrograde stenting is often unsuccessful. In these cases, delayed surgical repair should be considered (32)\n\nTable 2 Guidelines for managing bladder injury.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Recommendation\n      Level of evidence\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Bladder contusion requires no specific treatment and may be observed clinically\n      1C\n    \n    \n      Intraperitoneal bladder rupture should be managed by surgical exploration and primary repair\n      1B\n    \n    \n      Laparoscopy may be considered for repair of isolated intraperitoneal injuries in cases of hemodynamic stability and no other indications for laparotomy.\n      2B\n    \n    \n      In cases of severe intraperitoneal bladder rupture, during damage control procedures, urinary diversion via bladder and perivesical drainage or external ureteral stenting may be used.\n      1C\n    \n    \n      Uncomplicated blunt or penetrating extraperitoneal bladder injuries may be managed non-operatively, with urinary drainage via a urethral or suprapubic catheter, in the absence of other indications for laparotomy.\n      1C\n    \n    \n      Complex extraperitoneal bladder ruptures, i.e., bladder neck injuries, lesions associated with pelvic ring fracture, and/or vaginal or rectal injuries, should be explored and repaired.\n      1C\n    \n    \n      Surgical repair of extraperitoneal bladder rupture should be considered during laparotomy for other indications and during surgical exploration of the prevesical space for orthopedic fixations. In cases of hemodynamic instability, a urethral or suprapubic catheter may be inserted as a temporary measure and the repair of the bladder injury may be postponed.\n      1C\n    \n  \n\n\nIn general, all penetrating bladder injuries and cases of intraperitoneal bladder rupture (IBR) require surgical exploration and primary repair. \nLaparoscopic repair of isolated IBR is a viable option. Open surgical repair of bladder injuries is carried out in a double-layer fashion using monofilament absorbable suture. Single-layer repair is common during a laparoscopic approach.\n\nIn the absence of other indications for laparotomy, uncomplicated blunt or penetrating EBR may be managed conservatively, with clinical observation, antibiotic prophylaxis, and the insertion of a urethral catheter or suprapubic percutaneous cystostomy in cases of a concomitant urethral injury. Injury healing occurs within 10 days in more than 85% of cases. Surgical repair of EBR is indicated in complex injuries such as bladder neck injuries, injuries associated with pelvic fractures requiring internal fixation, and rectal or vaginal injuries. Furthermore, surgical repair of EBR may be considered in cases of non-resolution of urine extravasation 4 weeks after the traumatic event.\n\nGunshot injuries of the bladder are commonly associated with rectal injuries, which prompt fecal diversion. Commonly, these injuries are through-and-through (entry/exit site), requiring careful and complete pelvic inspection.\n\nUrethral catheterization, whenever possible, has the same efficacy as suprapubic cystostomy; therefore routine placement of a suprapubic tube is no longer recommended. Suprapubic catheterization may be reserved for patients with associated perineal injuries. Suprapubic drainage is recommended in children after the surgical repair of bladder rupture.6\n\nKey Points: Bladder Trauma\n\n\n  The incidence of bladder rupture during childhood is low, with the condition representing about 5% of urinary tract injuries.\n  Bladder injuries are mainly of four types: intraperitoneal bladder rupture (IBR), extraperitoneal bladder rupture (EBR), bladder contusion and bladder neck avulsion. IBR occurs in 15–25% of cases and EBR is the most common type, being found in 60–90% of patients, and it is more frequently associated with pelvic fractures.\n  Absolute indications for bladder imaging after abdominal trauma are limited to macroscopic hematuria associated with a pelvic fracture.\n  Stabilization of the patient and evaluation of the associated injuries are the priorities.\n  Bladder contusion requires no specific treatment and may be observed clinically.\n  Intraperitoneal bladder rupture should be managed by surgical exploration and primary repair.\n  Uncomplicated blunt or penetrating extraperitoneal bladder injuries may be managed non-operatively, with urinary drainage via a urethral or suprapubic catheter in the absence of any other indication for laparotomy.\n  Complex extraperitoneal bladder ruptures, i.e., bladder neck injuries, lesions associated with pelvic ring fracture, and/or vaginal or rectal injuries, should be explored and repaired.\n\n\nKey Points: Ureteral Trauma\n\n\n  Traumatic ureteral lesions are rare (less than 1%).\n  The most common cause of ureteral injury is penetrating trauma, especially gunshot wounds; only one-third of cases are caused by blunt trauma.\n  Perirenal stranding or hematomas, extravasation of contrast into the perirenal space, and presence of low-density retroperitoneal fluid around the genitourinary elements at imaging are indicative of ureteral injuries.\n  CT scan is the best method to diagnose ureteral trauma. Already in the excretory phase, it may not show passage of contrast towards the distal ureter, which may lead to suspicion of ureteral avulsion.\n  Contusions may require ureteral stenting when urine flow is impaired.\n  Partial lesions of the ureter should initially be treated conservatively with the use of a stent, with or without a diverting nephrostomy, in the absence of other indications for laparotomy.\n  Partial and complete ureteral transections or avulsions unsuitable for non-operative management may be treated with primary repair plus a double J stent or ureteral re-implant into the bladder in the case of distal lesions.\n  Ureteral injuries should be repaired operatively when discovered during laparotomy or in cases in which conservative management has failed.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nHusman D.

        "title": "Urethral Injury",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nUrethral traumas are part of the urological emergency conditions that often require multidisciplinary co-assessment. In the case of septic symptoms, all possible traumas in other organs and sources of infection should also be considered. In the case of acute symptoms of the scrotum or gross hematuria, immediate urological evaluation is required. The therapy depends on the severity of the injury; the options range from primary splinting using a catheter, possibly under visual control, to an end-to-end surgical anastomosis.\n\nUrethral injuries are mostly caused by traffic accidents. In principle, the trauma mechanism can be classified as blunt or penetrating. In addition, urethral injuries after iatrogenic interventions (catheterization, cystoscopy, etc.) or due to foreign bodies being introduced into the urethral lumen. In addition, iatrogenic injuries are much more common in children due to their more fragile and vulnerable urethra. As a result, transurethral instruments should only be performed by experienced urologists, and endoscopic stone treatment should not be extracted primarily, but if possible, lithotripsed in situ before extraction.\n\nDifferent degrees of injury to a urethral lesion is defined:\n\n\n  Mild laceration with preservation of epithelial continuity\n  Partial tear of the urethral epithelium\n  Complete avulsion of the urethra\n\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe physical examination often reveals a perineal tenderness and hematoma.\n\nBlood on/from the urethral meatus, difficulty/inability to micturate, rapidly increasing perineal/perianal hematoma or urinoma, penile swelling after injury to the Buck fascia must indicate the presence of a urethral lesion.\n\nThe patient can complain of gross hematuria and a possible difficult micturition up to urinary retention. However, the severity of the injury cannot be assessed from the hematuria.\n\nThe rupture of the proximal urethra (above the sphincter) with subsequent urinary retention is often seen in the context of a pelvic ring fracture near the symphysis.\n\nHematuria\n\nGross hematuria is a possible sign of urethral and bladder injuries. In extreme cases, increased clot formation (urinary bladder tamponade) with possible urinary retention may occur. In the event of excessive bleeding, hemorrhagic shock can also occur. Myoglobinuria, rifampicin therapy or the consumption of particular foods such as beetroot or blueberries can also cause urine discoloration and must be taken into account in the anamnesis. The most common source of bleeding is in the urinary bladder or prostate, less often ıs the urethra or from the upper urinary tract. The urine is constantly red in total gross hematuria from the bladder or the upper urinary tract. Any accompanying symptoms such as dysuria indicate an inflammatory cause.\n\nUrethral bleeding after accidentally pulling a urinary catheter is also possible. Usually, the injuries are minor, but the bleeding can appear very pronounced. The re-installation of a large-lumen urinary catheter for a few days is the treatment option of choice. The pressure generated on the urethral lesion usually leads to a rapid cessation of the bleeding.\n\nIf the hematuria is accompanied by proteinuria or microscopically deformed erythrocytes, a nephrologist should urgently evaluate a glomerular pathology.\n\nIn the case of painless hematuria, a prompt urological evaluation with cystoscopy and, if necessary, CT urography to rule out a malignant tumor of the urinary tract should be recommended.\n\nImaging\n\nA sonographic examination of the bladder is helpful. In the case of a full urinary bladder, relief with a suprapubic catheter is preferred. Also, carefully inserting a transurethral catheter, supported by a retrograde urethrocystography, helps assess the location of the injury. Retrograde urethrography is a gold standard for diagnosing urethral traumas, especially in boys. Endoscopically, the urethra can be realigned using a transurethral catheter inserted over a wire.\n\nUrethral injuries in girls usually present as a partial tear in the anterior wall, rarely as a complete tear in the proximal or distal urethra. In cases of suspicion, urethrocystoscopy is indicated for evaluation.\n\nManagement\n\nSince urethral trauma is not a life-threatening injury, it does not become the top priority in emergency management. However, it is essential to consider that this type of injury determines the patient's quality of life in the long term. Such an injury is associated with high rates of stenosis, recurrent urinary tract infections, multiple reoperations, impotence, and incontinence.\n\nPrompt information about possible complications and risks should be provided: the more proximal the urethral injury, the higher the risk of incontinence, impotence, and stricture formation over the long term.\n\nIf urethral injuries are suspected, the catheter should not be inserted without prior specialist urological assessment. Urine drainage should be provided, and preventing infections is essential to accelerate the healing process.\n\nUrethral injuries in children differ from adult patients because they have an immature pelvis, and the bladder is located relatively more intra-abdominal.\n\nWhen a pelvic fracture occurs, the fracture becomes more unsteady. A complete posterior urethral avulsion is more common than in adults. The coexistence of bladder and urethral injuries in children is seen at about 20% traumas, and anterior longitudinal tears are detected twice as often. Prepubertal girls are four times more likely to have a urethral injury with pelvic fractures than an adult woman. The incidence of anterior urethral injury in children is less than posterior urethral injury.\n\nFemale Urethral Injuries\n\nMinor straddle injuries to the urethra or vagina can occasionally result in substantial perineal bleeding. External and endoscopic examinations under anesthesia, suture closure of lacerations, and catheter drainage if necessary are the best management options.\n\nSignificant injuries are usually related to severe trauma and pelvic fracture and can result in longitudinal trauma to the bladder neck and urethra or total urethral dehiscence by bone fragments. In the case of difficulty in catheter placement, patients should undergo prompt cystoscopy, vaginoscopy, and rectum examination.\n\nStable patients should promptly have urethroplasty with urethral realignment, bladder neck repair, and vaginal laceration repair, as well as a diverting colostomy if a rectal injury occurs.\n\nMale Urethral Injuries\n\nMale Anterior Urethral Injuries\n\nCircumcision complications are among the leading male distal urethral injuries. Circumcisions can result in significant urethral damage, progress to urethrocutaneous fistulas, and urethral stenosis. In contrast, meatal stenosis can occur due to routine circumcision.\n\nAmputation of the glans is a potentially morbid complication of circumcision. Circumcision clamp methods, such as the Gomco and Plastibell clamps, have gained popularity due to their convenience. Such injuries are assumed to be the consequence of the incomplete release of the balano-preputial adhesions around the frenulum. Surgeons should verify that the mucosa has been completely released from the glans before inserting a circumcision clamp to avoid this issue.\n\nIf instant reimplantation is impossible or the amputated issue is unavailable, repair using buccal mucosa grafts should be performed after the initial injury heals.\n\nBulbar urethral injuries can often be managed with catheter drainage alone or with observation in the case of a minor injury. Retrograde urethrograms and endoscopies are not essential unless there is considerable urethral bleeding or a history of unsuccessful instrumentation efforts with blood at the meatus. Despite early management, late urethral strictures can occur. Endoscopic incisions could be used to manage these strictures if they are very short.\n\nMale Posterior Urethral Injuries\n\nPosterior urethral injuries are commonly associated with blunt trauma and pelvic fractures.\n\nDue to a lack of large series in children, male posterior urethral injuries remain controversial regarding the appropriate timing and approach for repair. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and optimal urine drainage are essential for whatever surgical method is chosen.\n\nAccording to several authors, three points in time for surgical intervention are described below:\n\n\n  immediate repair: within 48 hours,\n  delayed primary repair: within 2–14 days,\n  late surgical repair: within three months.\n\n\nPrimary anastomosis is recommended only in combination with a bladder neck or rectal injury, as it has been associated with late high incontinence rates and erectile dysfunction.\n\nThe majority of posterior urethral defects are short and may be repaired with perineal anastomosis. Initially, lengthy strictures were repaired in two stages; even so, as the field of urethral reconstruction has progressed, a paradigm shift toward one-stage repair has occurred, using free and pedicle-based grafts of the skin or buccal mucosa, or a combination of these methods.\n\nSummary\n\nUrethral traumas in children are uncommon and require multidisciplinary co-assessment to ensure the best possible management and avoid complications and long-term comorbidities. Management principles are noted in the Key Points section below.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Penetrating injuries caused by external trauma should be managed surgically promptly.\n  Retrograde urethrography is essential for diagnosing urethral traumas.\n  Urine drainage should be provided, and preventing infections is essential to accelerate the healing process.\n  Initial suprapubic cystostomy is recommended for major urethral injuries.\n  Circumcision complications are among the leading male iatrogenic distal urethral injuries.\n  Primary realignment may be performed in stable patients with short defects.\n  The treatment of choices for posterior urethral distraction injuries are posterior urethroplasty with primary and staged anastomosis.\n  The goal of therapy should be to prevent secondary complications such as urethral stricture, incontinence, urethrocutaneous fistula, periurethral diverticula, and impotence.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Evaluation and management of urethral injuries.\n\nReferences\n\n\nChapple CR.

        "title": "Penile and Scrotal Trauma",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nTrauma refers to injury caused by external force from a variety of mechanisms, including traffic- or transportation-related injuries, falls, assault (e.g., blunt weapon, stabbing, gunshot), explosions, animal bites, etc.1 Traumatic injuries are the leading cause of death in the United States for people ages 1–44 years, and a significant cause of morbidity and loss of productive life across all ages.2 Worldwide, traumatic injuries are the sixth leading cause of death and the fifth leading cause of moderate and severe disability.3 The kidneys are the most commonly injured genitourinary organ.\n\nThe lower urinary and genital tract may sustain injury through a wide variety of mechanisms. Although rarely life-threatening, mismanagement can lead to devastating long-term morbidity and, in some cases, permanent disability. In the acute scenario, it is of main relevance to distinguish between scenarios when immediate reconstruction is appropriate, as in testicular trauma with albuginea rupture, or better managed by a delayed correction.\n\nTraumatic injuries to external genitalia are relatively uncommon, mainly because of the huge mobility of the penis and scrotum. Trauma to the external genitalia occurs in up to two-thirds of patients who present with GU trauma.1,4 Most cases are caused by blunt trauma, but up to 35% of all gunshot wounds to the GU tract involve the external genitalia.5 Most cases of genital trauma occur in men not only because of anatomic differences but also because of greater rates of exposure to violence in this population as well as participation in contact sports.6,7\n\nWhen we are talking about pediatric genital trauma, we have some specific characteristics. Although most genital injuries in children are accidental, it is critical to assess whether trauma to the penis or the scrotum in boys, or the vagina in girls, is result of sexual abuse and assault. It is extremely important to know around 1 in 7 boys and 1 in 3 girls will be sexually abused in childhood. This is not obvious sometimes, and if there is any suspicion, we should look for confirmation to a safe discharge to home.\n\nMost trauma data from the 20th century were reported from single-institution data sets. With the expansion of electronic medical records and national trauma networks, national data sets have become a more accessible and significant source of information. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), originally created in 1970 by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, is one example of these national data sets. It has been used primarily to evaluate the magnitude of injury associated with consumer products, but because it provides a national probability estimate of all injury-related US emergency department presentations, it has proved to be a useful tool for evaluating many facets of trauma epidemiology. Studies made with NEISS data are probably the best source available right now to study pediatric genital trauma.7 From 1991–2010, the NEISS recorded 19,885 Emergency Department (ED) visits for genital injuries related to consumer products or sports in patients ≤18 years old, representing an estimate of 521,893 nationwide visits. Using U.S. Census Bureau data, this represents 0.35 genital injuries/1000 children/year. Pediatric genital injuries represented 0.6% of all pediatric injuries. In comparison, from 1991–2010, the NEISS recorded 3,268,610 ED visits for any injury related to consumer products or sports in patients ≤18 years old, representing an estimate of 109,559,166 nationwide visits. Using U.S. Census Bureau data, this represents 75.6 injuries/1000 children/year. The absolute number of pediatric genital injuries and the percentage of injuries affecting the genitals have risen between 1991 and 2010.7,8,9,10\n\nPenile Injury\n\nAs talked above penile injuries are quite uncommon, mainly because of mobility.11 Blunt phallic traumatic injury is usually of concern with an erect penis, when fracture of albuginea may result. As a general advice, prompt surgical management of penile injuries leads to adequate and acceptable cosmetic and functional results.11,12,13 In larger series, most penile injury in children occurs inadvertently from several causes. These include fractures, circumcision (the most common cause), hair tourniquet strangulation, motor vehicle accidents, animal bites, zippers and burns and scalds.5,7,11\n\nCircumcision and Strangulation\n\nDepending on the technique and surgical training, newborn circumcision has been shown to have variable rates of complications and injuries, as severe as amputation. Injuries are less common in the hospital and clinic setting and more often seen when a Mogen type device is utilized. Hair or thread strangulation usually results in circumferential damage with urethral injury associated. Accidental injuries with thread, hair, or rubber bands occur in children, but child abuse must be considered in such cases. Any child with unexplained penile swelling, erythema, or difficulty voiding should be examined closely for a hidden strangulating hair or string. Adults may place objects around the shaft as a means of sexual pleasure or to prolong an erection. The constricting device can reduce blood flow, cause edema, and induce ischemia; gangrene and urethral injury may develop in delayed presentations. Emergent treatment requires decompression of the constricted penis to allow blood flow and micturition. String, hair, and rubber bands should be incised promptly. Initial attempts to remove a solid constricting device causing penile strangulation involve lubrication of the shaft and foreign body and attempted direct removal. The damage is usually slow in onset and may not course with pain. Sometimes the hair is too small to be seen.11,12 Surgical repair of penile amputation in these situations usually course with good cosmetic and functional results after surgery.14 Urethral fistulas can occur in the proximal shaft in hair strangulation and distal in circumcision injury. The outcome of surgical repair as in hypospadias is quite good.11,12,13,14\n\nFracture\n\nRare in children, more common in adolescents and young adults during sexual intercourse or masturbation. Penile fracture is the disruption of tunica albuginea and rupture of the corpus cavernosum. It also has been described with rolling over or falling onto the erect penis.15\n\nThe site of rupture can occur anywhere along the penile shaft but distal to suspensory ligament are more common. The diagnosis is usually made by clinical history and physical examination. Patients usually describe a cracking sound followed by pain, detumescence and penile shaft swelling resulting in a typical eggplant deformity.1,12,13 The typical history makes adjunctive imaging studies unnecessary, when needed the penile ultrasound is rapid, readily available, noninvasive, inexpensive and accurate. The most recent AUA Urotrauma guideline statement recommend that penile fractures should be promptly explored and surgically repaired.1,12,13 Surgical reconstruction results in faster recovery, decreased morbidity, lower complications rates and lower incidence of long-term penile curvature.\n\nBlunt Trauma\n\nAlthough relatively rare, some authors have reported high numbers of patients presenting to emergency departments with toilet seat crushes, with more than 9000 occurring from 2002 to 2010. Usually this occurs in toilet training boys and most of these injuries are minor and treated conservatively as an outpatient.16\n\nBurns\n\nGenital burns are more common in children than in the adult population. Scalds are the most common etiology and are usually not isolated to the genitalia and can result in significant skin loss. The treatment may require transposition of skin by either graft or flap technique.17\n\nAnimal and Human Bites\n\nThe morbidity is related to the severity of the initial wound. Most victims are boys and dog bites are the most common injuries. Infectious complications are rare because treatment is sought early. Initial management includes copious irrigation, debridement, and immediate closure along with prophylactic use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Human bites produce contaminated wounds and should not be closed.18\n\nPenile Amputation\n\nVery rare and usually the result of genital self-mutilation. Occurs in adolescents with psychosis disorder. Reconstruction with microvascular anastomosis is the treatment of choice. The amputated penis should be kept in a double bag with saline without direct contact with ice to prevent hypothermic injury before surgical replantation.\n\nGunshot and Penetrating Injuries\n\nRare in children, more common in teenagers. Associated with significant associated injuries as abdominal and limb shots. Treatment principles include immediate exploration, copious irrigation, excision of foreign matter, antibiotic prophylaxis, and surgical closure. Urethral injuries have been reported in as high as 50% of penile gunshot wounds.13,19\n\nZipper Amputations\n\nZipper injuries to the penis more often happen to impatient boys or intoxicated men. Multiple maneuvers are available to free the entrapped skin and to remove the mechanism. After a penile block, the zipper slider and adjacent skin can be lubricated with mineral oil, followed by a single attempt to unzip and untangle the skin.13,20\n\nScrotal and Testicular Injury\n\nInjuries to the scrotum are not uncommon and occur most frequently in adolescents and young adults. Testis trauma in children is rare. Of all surgical cases for acute scrotum, these make up less than 5% of trips to the operating room.21 Penetrating trauma to the scrotum can include superficial injury to the skin and dartos or deeper injury into the tunica vaginalis. Although the testis is relatively protected by the mobility of the scrotum, reflexive cremasteric muscle contraction, and the tough fibrous tunica albuginea, blunt injury (usually the result of assault, sports-related events, and motor vehicle accidents) can result in rupture of the tunica albuginea, contusion, hematoma, dislocation, or torsion of the testis. Testicular injury results from blunt trauma in about 75% of cases. The right testicle lies higher than the left testicle in 60% to 70% of men and is thus more prone to being trapped against the symphysis pubis in blunt trauma.22\n\nIn cases of testicular rupture, the blunt force and trapping of the testicle can lead to rupture of the tunica albuginea, which encapsulates the testicle, resulting in extrusion of the seminiferous tubules. Patients with testicular rupture typically present with immediate scrotal pain after trauma, which is often accompanied by nausea or vomiting. However, patients may present after a delay, up to days after the injury, if they have a small rupture, which becomes increasingly more painful as time progresses. Ultrasonography can be used with very high sensitivity to diagnose a rupture, and if confirmed, operative intervention is required.23 However, if the ultrasonographic result is equivocal, patients should be taken to the operating room for exploration and potential repair if the suspicion for significant injury is high because early repair (within 72 hours) results in a rate of testicular salvage of 90% when compared with delayed repair or conservative management (45–55% orchiectomy rate).24,25 Scrotal ultrasonography can also reveal testicular contusion or hematocele, which are nonsurgical injuries or traumatic torsion or dislocation, which do require surgical intervention but are much less common than testicular rupture.26\n\nNonoperative management of testicular rupture is frequently complicated by infection, atrophy, necrosis, chronic unrelenting pain, and delayed orchiectomy. Testicular salvage rates exceed 90% with exploration and repair within 3 days of injury, whereas orchiectomy rates are threefold to eightfold higher with conservative management and delayed surgery.25\n\nVaginal Injury\n\nFemale genital trauma includes injuries to the labia, vulva or vagina, as well as the anogenital and urogenital structures. Worldwide, the most common cause of genital trauma in reproductive age women is injury sustained during childbirth. Accidental injuries may occur resulting in minor lacerations and bruising in the genital area that heal rapidly. Profuse bleeding can occur owing to the rich vascular supply in the genital area and may require operative intervention. Women and children may also be victims of violence.12,13 The crime of rape refers to nonconsensual sexual intercourse that is committed by physical force, threats of injury, or other duress. In certain populations, female genital mutilation (FGM), also called ‘‘female circumcision,’’ comprises procedures with partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury for cultural, religious, or other nontherapeutic reasons. This intentionally mutilative practice is strongly discouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO) and women’s rights groups. Genital injuries alone rarely result in death, but may result in chronic discomfort, dyspareunia, infertility, or fistula formation if unattended.17,27\n\nChildren and adolescents may sustain accidental genital injuries because of falling onto an object, which results in straddle injuries or impalement. Blunt trauma or crush injuries to the pelvis resulting in pelvis fractures. Straddle injuries occur when the soft tissues of the vulva are compressed between an object (e.g., frame of a bicycle) and the bones of the pelvis, the pubic symphysis, and pubic rami. Ecchymoses, abrasions, and lacerations may occur as a result of this trauma; extravasation of blood into the loose areolar tissue in the labia, along the vagina, the mons, or clitoral area may cause hematoma formation. Examples of commonplace accidental straddle injuries include falling onto the frame of a bicycle, playground equipment, or piece of furniture.5,7 Accidental penetrating and insufflation injuries These injuries occur if the victim falls upon a sharp or pointed object and impales herself. Examples of household and common objects associated with impalement include in-lawn sprinkling systems, pipes, fenceposts, and furniture (chair-tops, bedposts, or legs of stools).17,27\n\nConclusions\n\nAlthough pediatric genital injuries represent a small proportion of overall injuries presenting to the ED, genital injuries continue to rise despite public health measures targeted to decrease childhood injury. It is of utmost importance to have in mind the high risk of sexual abuse in child with genital trauma and this hypothesis must always be excluded before discharge. Prompt diagnosis and surgical correction leads to high success results, even in high complex lesions like penile amputation. The main diagnostic tool in children genital trauma is history and physical examination. The ultrasound examination is a great tool to help in diagnosis and management, being fast, easy, cheap and available. The long term results and sequel are typically good and acceptable when proper management is done.\n\nReferences\n\n\nAUA Urotrauma Guideline. 2020; 05 (1): 0–35.

        "title": "Acute Scrotum",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nAn “acute scrotum” refers to the rapid onset of a painful and/or swollen scrotum. Testicular torsion (TT) is the most worrisome diagnosis at the forefront of any clinician’s mind, and without early intervention, the testicle risks necrosis secondary to prolonged ischemia. Once TT is ruled out, other etiologies may be considered. Broadly speaking, the differential diagnosis of the pediatric acute scrotum also includes torsion of the appendix testis, epididymitis, orchitis, incarcerated hernia, vasculitis, testicular trauma, and cellulitis. In this chapter, we will highlight the evaluation of testicular torsion, torsion of the testis or epididymis adnexa, and epididymitis. The primary cause of these diagnoses is related to the anatomy of the testis or epididymis itself whereas the other diagnoses have secondary causes of scrotal swelling, pain, or infection (e.g., mumps orchitis secondary to Paramyxoviridae virus). Diagnosis and management of these other diagnoses in the differential require treatment of the primary cause and are discussed elsewhere in this textbook.\n\nAnatomy and Embryology\n\nThe scrotum is a sac of skin and underlying tissue inferior to the phallus in which the testicles and epididymis are contained. Deep to the skin is dartos fascia, a continuation of Colles fascia of the perineum, dartos fascia of the penis, and Scarpa’s fascia of the abdomen. Dartos fascia is elastic in nature. It provides blood to the scrotal skin and, along with the cremasteric reflex of the testis, helps regulate testis temperature by contracting (elevating) or relaxing (dropping) the scrotum as a whole. The scrotum is divided into lateral compartments by the scrotal septum. Internally, the septum is composed of thickened dartos fascia. Externally the septum manifests as the median scrotal raphe.\n\nThe tunica vaginalis is the structural lining of the interior of the scrotum that surrounds the testicles. The tunica vaginalis is derived from the processus vaginalis (or vaginal process), an embryonic outpouching of the abdominal peritoneum that spans the length of the inguinal canal into the scrotum prior to its obliteration. After the inguinal portion is obliterated, the remaining distal sac surrounds the testis and consists of two layers: a visceral layer and a parietal layer. The visceral layer is adherent to the tunica albuginea, the outermost surface of the testis. The parietal layer reflects onto the inner surface of the scrotum.\n\nThe testis is an ovoid-shaped male gonad located within each side of the scrotum and which serves endocrine and reproductive functions via the production of hormones (namely, testosterone) and sperm. Sperm is produced within the seminiferous tubules of the testis and travels through the rete testis to the efferent ductules, which connect to the head of the epididymis. The epididymis is a tortuously coiled tube that rests upon the posterolateral aspect of the testis. It functions to store and mature sperm until release through the vas deferens en route to the ampulla of the vas, the reservoir for sperm mature for emission.\n\nThe spermatic cord is a major structure contained within the scrotum. It originates at the deep (internal) inguinal ring of the abdominal wall, runs through the inguinal canal, and passes through the superficial (external) inguinal ring into the scrotum. The spermatic cord contains nerves, vasculature, and ducts. It is surrounded by three layers of fascial tissue (superficial to deep): the external spermatic fascia (a continuation of the external oblique fascia), the cremaster muscle (continuation of the internal oblique musculature), and the internal spermatic spermatic fascia (continuation of the transversalis fascia. In addition to these individual layers, the spermatic cord includes (Figure 1):\n\nVasculature:\n\n\n  Testicular artery (a branch of the aorta)\n  Cremasteric artery and vein (a branch of the inferior epigastric vessels)\n  Artery to the vas deferens (a branch of the superior vesical artery)\n  Pampiniform plexus (venous network distal to the inguinal ring)\n\n\nNerves:\n\n\n  Ilioinguinal nerve (joins the spermatic cord superficial to the external spermatic fascia from within the inguinal canal to provide sensation to the upper scrotum and penile skin)\n  Genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve (supplies motor activity to the cremasteric muscle and sensation to the anterior scrotum)\n  Autonomic nerves\n\n\nOther:\n\n\n  Vas deferens\n  Lymphatic vessels\n  Processus vaginalis\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Distal contents of the spermatic cord and tunica vaginalis. Attribution: OpenStax College\n\nThe differentiation, development, and descent of the testes is described in other chapters.\n\nGeneral Evaluation and Diagnosis\n\nFor the pediatric patient presenting with acute testicular pain and/or scrotal swelling, a careful history and physical exam should be performed.\n\nKey elements of a patient’s history should be obtained, including age, the nature of onset of pain (e.g., abrupt or gradual onset, presence of trauma), location and radiation of pain, and associated symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, hematuria, dysuria, fever, constipation). Associated symptoms can be helpful in both solidifying a diagnosis of TT or ruling out TT for other diagnoses. TT commonly presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and/or vomiting. On the other hand, dysuria and the presence of systemic fevers would suggest another etiology, such as epididymitis.\n\nThe physical exam should include an abdominal exam and genital exam. The abdominal exam should include assessment of costovertebral tenderness for evidence of flank pain, which may represent ureteric colic with referred pain to the groin. Evidence of hernia or cellulitis in the groin region should also be noted.1 The presence of isolated abdominal pain should still prompt a genital exam to rule out an acute scrotum, especially in younger boys who cannot adequately communicate their needs, boys with developmental delay, and boys with potentially altered sensorium.2\n\nThe genital examination includes assessment of the scrotum and bilateral testes, beginning with inspection and followed by palpation. Inspection of the skin should note erythema suggestive of cellulitis. In lighter-skinned children, a faint blue-ish hue (“blue dot” sign) may be seen on the lateral scrotal skin in children with appendix testis or epididymis torsion, though this physical exam sign is present in a minority of cases and not relevant to children with darker skin.3 Gentle palpation may be achieved by rolling the entire testicular surface between the thumb and forefingers. This exam is often difficult to perform in the setting of TT due to testicular edema and the associated reactive, tight hydrocoele. A high-riding testis when compared to the contralateral side should be noted and is suggestive of TT (by way of elevation of the testis as the spermatic cord twists and shortens). The lie of the testis, whether vertical or horizontal, is also of interest. Importantly, the bell clapper deformity results in a horizontal lie and is present in males with an abnormally superior attachment of the tunica vaginalis to the spermatic cord. This anatomical variant permits free rotation of the testis and predisposes the patient to intravaginal torsion (discussed later). Note this abnormality is difficult to distinguish in a normal setting and is unlikely to be established in the setting of TT secondary to edema and skin changes.\n\nAdditional examination maneuvers may elicit the diagnosis:\n\n\n  Scrotal masses should be defined by transillumination (indicative of a hydrocele) and attempted reduction (indicative of a patent processus vaginalis)\n  The cremasteric reflex should be assessed by stroking the ipsilateral thigh of the affected testicle. The reflex normally causes cremasteric contraction and elevation of the testis within the scrotum. Absence of the reflex in a patient presenting with acute scrotal pain classically suggests the diagnosis of TT; this finding is 100% sensitive and 66% specific.4 However, in a young child, the reflex arc may be underdeveloped and absent in an otherwise healthy individual.5,6 Therefore, it is important to first assess for a cremasteric reflex on the contralateral “normal” side to establish a baseline exam.\n  Elevating the scrotal contents is a maneuver taught to distinguish between epididymitis and TT. The relief of pain upon scrotal elevation, classically called a positive Prehn’s sign, is suggestive of epididymitis and is not reproducible in TT, though this is not always reliable test in children.1\n\n\nInitial diagnostic testing, which will be further discussed, usually includes:\n\n\n  Urinalysis (UA) and urine culture. These tests are performed to rule out urinary tract infection and bacterial epididymitis. Children presenting with TT will not generally have signs of infection on properly-collected urine specimens\n  Color Doppler Ultrasonography (CDUS). This is a confirmatory test identifying lack of vascular flow to a testis\n\n\nTesticular Torsion\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe reported incidence of TT is as high as 1 in 4,000 for males age 25 or younger7 to as low as 3.8 per 100,000 in males age 18 or younger.8 Incidence has a bimodal distribution, peaking in the first year of life (typically first month) and the pubertal period (12 years of age). This bimodal distribution corresponds to the difference in pathogenesis in the newborn and peripubertal period (extravaginal torsion versus intravaginal torsion of the spermatic cord, respectively).\n\nPathogenesis\n\nTT occurs when the testicle rotates around its spermatic cord. The twisted cord compresses the testicle’s venous network, causing testicular edema, restriction of venous outflow, and later occlusion of arterial inflow. Prolonged ischemia is deleterious and if left unresolved minimizes the chance of testicular viability.\n\nTwo types of TT exist: intravaginal and extravaginal torsion.\n\nExtravaginal torsion occurs when the tunica vaginalis and its contents, including the testis, turn as a unit about the spermatic cord axis. This phenomenon is made possible by unfused scrotal layers in the neonatal period, allowing the tunica vaginalis to move within the dartos fascia-lined hemiscrotal compartment. Extravaginal torsion occurs exclusively in the neonatal period or prenatally and has been reported to occur as late as 1–3 months after birth.9 Neonatal TT is rare compared to intravaginal torsion with an incidence of 6.1 per 100,000.10\n\nIntravaginal torsion occurs when the testicle twists about the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis. The so-called “bell clapper deformity” is the primary risk factor predisposing to intravaginal torsion. Normally the visceral and parietal tunica vaginalis layers are fused posteriorly and inferiorly, securing the testis within the tunica vaginalis compartment. In males with a bell clapper deformity, the tunica vaginalis completely invests the testis, epididymis, and distal length of the spermatic cord without visceral and parietal fusion points.11 An autopsy series reported a 12% incidence of the bell clapper deformity, which, notably, is higher than the incidence of TT.12 The high incidence of bilateral bell clapper deformity rationalizes preventative orchidopexy on the contralateral, unaffected side.\n\nIt should be noted that perinatal (extravaginal) torsion is not thought to be associated with a contralateral bell clapper deformity and subsequent risk for intravaginal TT. Conversely, intravaginal torsion on one side likely signals the presence of a contralateral bell clapper deformity and risk for subsequent, metachronous contralateral intravaginal torsion. In a single-surgeon series of 50 consecutive patients taken to the operating room for exploration of a nonpalpable testis revealing a testicular nubbin, only 1 patient showed evidence of a contralateral bell clapper deformity. The authors contrasted this with 27 straight cases of TT in older boys in whom 21 (78%) had a contralateral bell clapper deformity.13\n\n\nFigure 2 Bell clapper deformity in a case of intravaginal torsion (the left testis has undergone detorsion). Neither testis possess fusion of the tunica vaginalis visceral and parietal layers, and as a result, the tunica vaginalis has retracted high on the spermatic cord and both testes are left to hang freely, demonstrating a transverse lie relative to the spermatic cord. One can imagine if the tunica vaginalis parietal layer were intact that the testes would be hanging completely within the tunica vaginalis, like the clapper of a bell.\n\n\nFigure 3 Intravaginal torsion (left) and extravaginal torsion (right). Tunica vaginalis is highlighted in yellow. In intravaginal torsion, spermatic cord twisting occurs separately and within the tunica vaginalis. In extravaginal torsion, the spermatic cord and tunica vaginalis twist as a singular unit.\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis of Testicular Torsion in the Neonate\n\nThe presentation of a neonate with extravaginal TT is variable, which is likely reflective of the disease process as well as the circumstances surrounding the birthing and early care of a neonate. Newborn babies may collect edema in the perineum during the birthing process, and the scrotum can appear particularly enlarged and erythematous in the early hours after birth. There may also be an effect from maternal hormones. Congenital hydroceles are common and may be largest immediately after birth. Collectively, these changes may make it difficult for clinicians to differentiate specific epididymal and testicular anatomy on palpation alone.\n\nExtravaginal TT in a neonate will commonly present with an enlarged, hardened hemiscrotum. Birthing and postnatal care teams need to be keen to subtle exam differences between the respective hemiscrotum. The right and left hemiscrotum should be inspected and palpated individually, not as a unit. Increased firmness to one side, loss of scrotal rugae, or differential skin changes should be noted and trigger the need for repeated exams. Remarkable findings on initial exam or changes on serial exams should prompt urgent urological consultation.\n\nExtravaginal torsion noted at the time of birth is unlikely to be salvageable. In a review of the literature, over 90% of neonatal torsions considered either “prenatal” or “postnatal” underwent unilateral orchiectomy.14 More important than salvaging the more obviously affected side is timely diagnosis or prevention of asynchronous extravaginal torsion. This frequently requires surgical exploration as unilateral scrotal exam findings may be so profound that they obscure findings of the contralateral side. Additionally, CDUS is technically difficult in a neonate, particularly at centers where sonographers are not accustomed to imaging newborns. Urgent exploration of the neonatal scrotum in settings of suspected unilateral neonatal extravaginal torsion is controversial. The decision to surgically explore the scrotum of a newborn boy in the setting of a unilateral exam suggestive of extravaginal torsion pits the unlikely salvageability of the affected testis and anesthetic risks to the newborn against the rare but devastating consequences of asynchronous extravaginal TT. Case reports of bilateral, asynchronous extravaginal torsion abound in the literature. Recent publications have tried to quantify the risk of asynchronous torsion to the neonate. One review of the literature encompassing 152 studies representing 1336 patients reported 11.8% of all neonatal torsion events were asynchronous with a median time to second torsion of 1 day. The authors calculated a number needed to treat (e.g. surgically explore) to avoid bilateral orchiectomy to be 1.6, and the number needed to treat to avoid solitary testicular atrophy to be 2.6. A separate 20-year, single-institution chart review reported a 3% risk of asynchronous bilateral perinatal torsion.15 Given the improved safety of perinatal anesthesia in recent decades, it is the authors’ opinion that the benefits of early and urgent surgical exploration should be considered in the setting of unilateral perinatal torsion.\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis in the Older Child\n\nFor any patient presenting with acute onset scrotal pain, a diagnosis of TT should be promptly confirmed or ruled out. It is the diagnosis that poses the most time-sensitive threat to the organ. Clinicians should bear in mind a focused history and physical exam are the only prerequisites for surgical exploration. CDUS may confirm the suspected diagnosis of TT or rule out end-organ ischemia. The presence of vascular flow on CDUS does not rule out the presence of developing ischemia (as venous outflow is likely to be reduced prior to edema and vascular congestion that limits arterial inflow), recent or intermittent TT, or incomplete or partial torsion. In the latter setting, the spermatic cord may rotate about its axis enough to cause vascular compromise but not completely enough to cause abrupt cessation of blood flow.\n\nHistory\n\nThe classic presentation of intravaginal TT consists of acute onset testicular pain in a peripubescent male. Patients or their parents often describe sudden onset of severe pain. The pain may begin at rest, and patients will commonly report waking from sleep with sudden pain. Patients may report pain following trauma to the scrotum. In this latter setting, it's hypothesized the trauma itself is unlikely the cause of TT but a misremembered or unrelated event. In fact, history of recent genital trauma has been identified as a cause of misdiagnosis and resultant delay in treatment.2\n\nCommon associated symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.16 Importantly, abdominal pain and/or nausea with or without emesis may precede the onset of testicular pain. This creates a diagnostic enigma with potentially detrimental consequences to clinicians who hone their exam to the abdomen and omit a genitourinary exam. Isolated abdominal pain has been shown to be significantly associated with delayed presentations (&gt;24 hours) and higher rates of orchiectomy.2\n\nThe presence of associated symptoms may be helpful in prioritizing differential diagnoses as appendix testis or epididymis torsion and epididymitis or orchitis are more likely to present as isolated scrotal pain. Patients uncommonly report dysuria or gradual onset of pain. These symptoms should prompt clinicians to consider other diagnoses, such as epididymitis (sterile or bacterial), orchitis, or urinary tract infection.\n\nPhysical Exam\n\nAbdominal and genitourinary exam should be performed. Scrotal skin may reveal erythema, induration, or warmth. A tight hydrocele with decreased presence of scrotal rugae is often noted. In those with fair skin presenting in a delayed setting, a tight hydrocele with a dusky hue may reflect a necrotic testis and/or hematocele. Such skin changes have been shown to be predictive of TT.17\n\nAn abnormal cremasteric reflex suggests an increased likelihood of TT.17,18 However, the presence of a normal cremasteric reflex cannot sufficiently rule out a diagnosis of TT.19 Likewise, the absence of a cremasteric reflex is not highly specific for the diagnosis. When checking for cremasteric reflexes, providers should first examine the contralateral side as the absence of an ipsilateral reflex is only clinically relevant in the presence of a contralateral reflex. Clinicians may find the affected testis has a horizontal lie (bell-clapper deformity) or a “high-riding” position (from the twisted spermatic cord elevating the testis into the inguinal canal).\n\nUtilization of the TWIST score (introduced in 2013 by Barbosa et al) may allow clinicians to risk-stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk for TT based on physical exam alone. A summed score of 0-7 is calculated after determining the presence of 5 symptoms: hard testis (2 points), testis swelling,2 absent cremasteric reflex,1 nausea/vomiting,1 and high riding testis.120 According to the score algorithm, high risk patients (a score ≥5) have a positive predictive value of 100% for TT, thus clinicians can consider proceeding directly to surgical exploration as there is minimal benefit to CDUS. Low risk patients (≤2) have a negative predictive value of 100% for TT, thus they do not require CDUS to rule out torsion. Intermediate risk patients may benefit from CDUS to confirm the diagnosis. A study evaluating the usefulness of the TWIST score amongst nonurological nonphysician providers determined a PPV of 93.5% and NPV of 100% when high risk was defined as a score of greater than 6, intermediate risk as 1-5, and low risk as 0.21 (Figure 4)\n\nTable 1 The TWIST score and risk stratification groups.

Notably, this study evaluated the usefulness of the TWIST score amongst nonurologic nonphysician providers (to mirror emergency room triage personnel) and uses different thresholds for low, intermediate, and high-risk scores than the original Barbosa et al. 2013 description\n\nInitial Tests\n\nUrinalysis (UA) is a low-cost, rapid test useful in the setting of acute scrotal pain. It can be helpful to distinguish TT from bacterial epididymitis or urinary tract infection, both of which the UA would be expected to demonstrate pyuria. In TT, the UA would be expected to be unremarkable.\n\nImaging\n\nRoutine use is controversial, and studies assessing the accuracy and utility of imaging abound.22,23,24 If the diagnosis of TT is equivocal based upon the gathered history and physical, then imaging may be pursued. However, imaging should not be used as a substitute for an adequate history and physical exam. Unnecessary imaging can delay surgery and increase cost of care. Imaging is not required to diagnose TT.\n\nColor Doppler Ultrasonography\n\nCDUS is useful for visualization of testicular anatomy, including spermatic cord architecture, testicular blood flow, and testicular echotexture. Decreased or absent testicular blood flow on US has a specificity of 99% and a sensitivity of 63% for TT.24 As a rule of thumb, imaging should always be compared to the contralateral, unaffected side. In TT, the affected testis may appear edematous and enlarged. Clinicians should pay particular attention to comparative testis volumes in cases of equivocal CDUS as this can be a clue to the diagnosis. A reactive hydrocele may also be present.25 Heterogenous echotexture in the setting of absent Doppler signal likely indicates the onset of coagulative necrosis of a nonviable testis.\n\nOccasionally, normal or increased arterial flow is visualized in a patient with TT, generating a misleading false-negative result. One multi-center study demonstrated 24% of their confirmed spermatic cord torsions had normal or increased testicular flow on preoperative CDUS.26 Conceptually, it has been postulated that as the spermatic cord twists, venous outflow from the testis is likely affected prior to arterial inflow. Therefore, decreased or maintained arterial flow may hark the onset of testicular ischemia and should not necessarily be regarded as reassuring in the setting of absence or decreased outflow. Decreased blood flow may be suggestive of partial or incomplete torsion and intermittent torsion of the spermatic cord. It should be highlighted that Doppler and vascular waveform measurement is highly dependent on the sonographer and substantially more difficult to obtain in babies and young children. In settings of discordant history, physical exam, and CDUS findings, clinicians should exercise a high index of suspicion for partial or intermittent TT.\n\nHigh Resolution Ultrasonography\n\nhigh resolution ultrasonography (HRUS) is a more sensitive (97.3%) and specific (99%) imaging method compared to CDUS.26 It allows for direct visualization of a torsed spermatic cord. Studies have shown well-trained sonographers and radiologists can accurately identify tortuosity in the spermatic cord via the so-called “snail-shaped” or “whirlpool” spermatic cord signs. There is controversy in the literature about the utility of the HRUS identification of spermatic cord “whirlpool” signs. When correctly diagnosed in the setting of abnormal testis blood flow, these spermatic cord abnormalities can be definitive evidence of ongoing intravaginal torsion. However, a common criticism of HRUS-identified spermatic cord abnormalities is that literature highlighting these abnormalities have been unsuccessful in identifying the denominator of cases or how many children with torsion do not have identifiable spermatic cord changes on TT. In other words, the absence of identified or reported signs of spermatic cord tortuosity should not rule out the diagnosis of TT, and clinicians should not use HRUS-findings of the spermatic cord alone as indication for exploration.\n\nNuclear Scintigraphy\n\nThis test uses intravenous technetium-99m pertechnetate to evaluate testicular perfusion. Prior to CDUS, scintigraphy was the imaging test of choice for suspected TT. Studies have reported similar sensitivity and specificity to CDUS.27,28 However, the scan can take several hours to perform, is not always readily available, and risks prolonged testicular ischemia time. For these reasons, scintigraphy is rarely utilized in the modern diagnosis of TT.\n\nTreatment Options\n\nTT requires prompt surgical correction. Both the time since onset of pain (conceptualized as being equivalent to testicular ischemia time) and degree of spermatic cord torsion directly impact testis salvage rates.29,30 As a rule of thumb, the testis is most likely to be viable (&gt;90% likelihood) if scrotal exploration is performed within the first 6 hours of symptom onset. After the initial 6-hour window, the testicle may still be viable but at precipitously decreasing rates, thus highlighting the importance of timely intervention.31 However, even within this timeframe, patients may experience some degree of postoperative testicular atrophy from ischemia damage.\n\nManual Detorsion\n\nManual detorsion, or bedside rotation of the testis within the scrotum, is an option for initial management while awaiting urologic consultation and emergent surgical treatment or transfer to another facility. The maneuver can restore some blood flow to the testis and improve odds of testicle viability at time of exploration.32,33 Manual detorsion does not obviate the need for surgery and should not delay surgical intervention.\n\nThe classic teaching in TT manual detorsion is that the testis twists about the spermatic cord in a lateral to medial direction. Steps to achieve manual detorsion instruct the clinician to unwind the spermatic cord in the opposite direction: medial to lateral. The motion of rotating the testicle away from midline is what is commonly referred to as “opening the book.” The clinician should grasp the affected testis between his or her thumb and forefinger and gently rotate the testis within the scrotum outward toward the thigh for a full 360 degrees. Successful manual detorsion is usually suggested by immediate relief of pain and return of arterial flow on CDUS. Multiple rotations may be necessary depending on how many twists the cord possesses. In an ideal scenario, point-of-care ultrasound or CDUS can be used to objectively demonstrate improvement in blood flow. If pain relief is not achieved or is worsened by manually detorsing the testicle away from midline, detorsion through an inward (medial) rotation could be attempted.\n\nContrary to this classic teaching, retrospective studies demonstrated that at least a third of their cases of TT occurred in the lateral direction.29,34 Therefore, while the “opening the book” technique is likely to reduce torsion of the spermatic cord and potentially restore blood flow in the majority of cases, clinicians who attempt manual detorsion need to be attentive to the possibility of either incomplete detorsion of a spermatic cord with several revolutions or increasing the degrees of revolution, the latter of which may worsen the degree of ischemia. Therefore, it is the authors’ opinion manual detorsion ought not to be attempted if surgical intervention is readily available. Additionally, manual detorsion ought not be attempted if the diagnosis is in question or if the maneuver will delay definitive surgical intervention. If clinicians performing manual detorsion are not those who will provide definitive surgical intervention, it is vital to communicate the maneuver was attempted and the result.\n\nSurgical Correction\n\nSurgery management entails either detorsion and orchidopexy (fixation of the testicle to scrotal dependent wall) or orchiectomy of the affected testis, depending on the viability of the organ when examined intraoperatively. In either case, orchidopexy of the contralateral testis is the standard of care given the high probability of a contralateral bell clapper deformity.\n\nOverview of Surgical Technique:\n\nA midline raphe incision or bilateral horizontal incisions are most common. A midline raphe incision allows for each hemi scrotum to be explored through a single incision.\n\n\n  Midline scrotal incision\n  Electrosurgery dissection through dartos and into affected hemiscrotum\n  Delivery of tunica vaginalis through dartos incision\n  (Inspection of tunica vaginalis and spermatic cord for extravaginal torsion in cases of neonatal torsion)\n  Incision and eversion of tunica vaginalis to allow delivery and inspection of affected testicle and epididymis. Note the presence of intravaginal torsion of the spermatic cord and color of the testis and epididymis\n  Detorsion of spermatic cord and testis, noting direction and degrees of torsion\n  Envelopment of detorsed testis in a warm gauze sponge\n  Perform same electrosurgery dissection of dartos on the contralateral hemiscrotum to expose contralateral tunica vaginalis and testicle\n  Incision and eversion of tunica vaginalis to allow delivery and inspection of contralateral testicle and epididymis. Note the presence of a bell clapper deformity\n  Return to detorsed testis and repeat inspection to determine viability. If obviously nonviable, perform an orchiectomy. If viable, perform orchidopexy. This is a subjective assessment and often variable between providers. If viability appears indeterminate, providers may choose to perform micro-Doppler assessment of the testis to search for arterial flow or incise the testis with an equatorial incision to identify bleeding and healthy-appearing seminiferous tubules secondary to release of compartment syndrome pressure. In the case where an equatorial tunica vaginalis fasciotomy leads to tunica vaginalis bleeding, healthy-appearing seminiferous tubules, and overall improvement in testis color, tunica vaginalis patch augmentation of the tunica albuginea has been described.35 (Video 1)\n  An affected testis that has been determined viable and the normal contralateral testis should be secured in the scrotum to prevent future torsion. Testes ought to be secured with 3 points of fixation, either to each other (through the scrotal septum as in a “septopexy” technique) or in a dependent position in their respective hemiscrotum. The authors use a 5-0 polypropylene (non-absorbable) suture\n  Close the scrotal incision(s) in a typical fashion. For cases where an orchiectomy is performed in the setting of long-standing, delayed-presentation of testis torsion with substantial edema, a scrotal drain may be left to help prevent infection, hematocele, or hydrocele formation\n\n\n\n  \n  [Video 1](#video-1){:.video-link}. Intraoperative management of testicular torsion. In this case, surgical correction included provision of a tunica vaginalis flap. Note: This video was created for and featured in the American Urological Association core curriculum educational video library.\n\n\nSuggested Follow-Up\n\nPatients who undergo surgical management for testicular torsion should be seen at least once in outpatient clinic follow-up to verify proper wound healing and a non-concerning physical exam. After attempted testicular detorsion and orchidopexy for TT, clinicians should document the size of testes and the presence or absence of atrophy to an affected testis. The term “testicular salvage” is best reserved for affected testes which have shown preserved volume in follow-up.\n\nDuring follow-up, the authors typically discuss the following topics with patients and their families:\n\n\n  In the setting of orchidopexy of an affected testis, the appearance of and vascular flow to the affected testis should the patient ever receive another CDUS for another reason\n  In the setting of orchiectomy of an affected testis, there is potential for a testicular prosthesis after completion of puberty\n  Although recurrent testicular torsion is theoretically impossible, patients may feel pain or abnormalities for other reasons. Patients may benefit from monthly self-exams and should alert their parents or doctors immediately if they feel pain or palpate something different\n  All patients, especially those who have undergone orchiectomy for TT and now have a solitary testis, should be encouraged to wear a protective athletic cup during potentially contact sports and recreation. There are modern, slim-profile athletic cups that fit into comfortable compression shorts and sliding pants\n\n\nTorsion of the Testis Adnexa\n\nBoth the testis and epididymis commonly have a small, associated appendage off their superior pole. The appendix testis is an embryologic remnant of the paramesonephric duct. The appendix epididymis is an embryologic remnant of the mesonephric duct system. Either of these structures can twist about their axis, much in the same way as the spermatic cord twists in intravaginal TT, leading to ischemia and eventual necrosis. Presentation can mimic TT with abrupt onset of scrotal pain and swelling. There are, however, some key pertinent negative findings on history and physical exam the authors have anecdotally noticed in comparing testis adnexal torsion with TT:\n\n\n  Patients with adnexal torsion are less likely to report nausea and vomiting. This is likely secondary to the lack of visceral sensation from adnexal ischemia compared to testis ischemia\n  Patients with adnexal torsion are not likely to have an elevated testis lie within the scrotum\n  Patients with adnexal torsion often have a good testicular flow on CDUS with characteristic findings of a heterogeneous, avascular small structure adjacent and separate from the testis36 (See Figure 5 for a representative image from the authors’ collection)\n\n\n\nFigure 5 Color Doppler ultrasound image of an avascular, edematous, and heterogeneous-appearing torsed appendix testis or epididymis (yellow arrow)\n\nOn physical exam, adnexal torsion will present with a swollen, tender hemiscrotum. The testis will appear to have a normal, dependent lie. In light-skinned individuals, an occasional “blue dot” sign may be identified on the lateral scrotal wall, corresponding to the appearance of the ischemic appendage through scrotal skin thinned by a translucent hydrocele sac. To patients who can tolerate a thorough exam, this point will correspond to focal tenderness. Note that the blue dot sign has been reported in as few as 10% of adnexal torsion cases and will be difficult to identify in dark-skinned patients.\n\nIf the diagnosis is in question or testicular ischemia cannot be ruled out, surgical exploration is recommended. At exploration, the surgeon will find a torsed appendix with an otherwise normal appearing testis and epididymis (Figure 6 and Figure 7). The adnexal appendage can be surgically excised and the scrotum closed. For cases where good testicular flow is confirmed, history and objective data are inconsistent with TT, and adnexal torsion is likely, surgical exploration can be deferred.\n\nTreatment for adnexal torsion is conservative and includes rest, periodic ice in the acute period, scrotal elevation, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. The authors have routinely ordered a follow-up scrotal US within one week if pain persists to confirm the diagnosis and 4-6 weeks after pain resolution to document the adnexal mass seen on initial scrotal US has regressed.\n\n\nFigure 6 Forceps grasping a torsed appendix epididymis\n\n\nFigure 7 Appearance of an engorged appendix epididymis at scrotal exploration in what was thought to be an equivocal exam for TT\n\nEpididymitis\n\nEpidemiology\n\nEpididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis: the coiled, tubular structure which sits posteriorly and superiorly upon the oval-shaped testis. The epididymis functions to transport and mature sperm from the testis. In adolescents, epididymitis accounts for 35-71% of cases of acute scrotal pain.37 While the condition occurs most frequently in sexually active older adolescents, it may also occur in younger patients secondary to viral infection or chemical (urine) inflammation.\n\nPathogenesis\n\nIn older patients, epididymitis most commonly occurs due to bacterial infection. Typically, a sexually transmitted infection (STI) is the culprit, especially in younger aged men, which results in migration of bacteria from the urethra into the vas and epididymis. Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis are the most common infectious agents in this population. Similarly, infected urine from a urinary tract infection may reflux into the vas deferens and cause epididymitis. This may be precipitated by heavy lifting.\n\nIn younger children, the most common cause of epididymitis is sterile and secondary to pressurized voiding of “sterile” urine to the ejaculatory ducts and back through the vas deferens to the epididymis (so called “sterile” or “chemical” epididymitis). Less common etiologies are secondary to viral infections (e.g., both named, like mumps orchitis secondary to Paramyxoviridae virus, or unnamed viruses), trauma, and tuberculosis.\n\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis of epididymitis is clinical and often one of exclusion. A patient presenting with gradual onset of scrotal pain, scrotal swelling, and (possibly) fever should raise a high index of suspicion for epididymitis. They may also report symptoms of dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence, and/or urethral discharge. In young children in whom chemical epididymitis is suspected, a careful history of voiding and constipation should be elicited. Parents will often report these children have long periods of urine holding followed by urinary urgency. Constipation may lead boys to both pressurized urine and stool voiding, both of which can pressurize urine reflux down the ejaculatory duct and vas deferens.\n\nPhysical exam should reveal a normal, vertical lie of the testis, normal cremasteric reflex, and relief of pain with elevation of the testis (Prehn sign). Palpation of the epididymis on the posterior aspect of the testis will elicit tenderness.\n\nWork-up should include urinalysis and urine culture. In older patients with a concerning history or exam, CDUS may be necessary to rule out TT and other pathology, from testicular rupture to scrotal abscesses. In younger children in whom chemical epididymitis is expected, 1) bladder ultrasound assessing bladder distention and/or elevated post-void residual, and 2) plain film of the abdomen assessing for constipation can add support to the diagnosis.\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment is variable and depends upon the cause of epididymitis. The primary treatment for epididymitis caused by STI is appropriate antimicrobials. Both ceftriaxone and doxycycline should be administered to treat N. gonorrhea and C. trachomatis. Azithromycin may be substituted for doxycycline in patients with an allergy or contraindication. Additional supportive care includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics and scrotal support. Partners should be evaluated and treated with antibiotics, as well. Treatment for chemical epididymitis in a young child includes supportive care with scheduled non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics and supportive underwear. Urinary holding, pressurized urine voiding, and constipation need to be addressed concomitantly.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, an “acute scrotum” is the clinical descriptor of the rapid onset of a painful or swollen scrotum. The differential diagnosis includes but is not limited to testicular torsion, torsion of the appendix testes, and epididymitis. Testicular torsion should be ruled out prior to the workup of alternative etiologies.\n\nKey Points\n\n  The incidence of testicular torsion (TT) has a bimodal distribution: the first year of life (~1 month of age), when torsion is more likely to be extravaginal, and the pubertal period (~12 years of age) when torsion is more likely to be intravaginal\n  The bell clapper deformity is the primary risk factor predisposing to intravaginal torsion\n  TT is a clinical diagnosis: a focused history and physical exam are the only prerequisites for surgical exploration\n  In cases with equivocal clinical findings, color doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) may be utilized to confirm end-organ ischemia\n  The presence of vascular flow on CDUS does not necessarily rule-out the presence of developing ischemia\n  Imaging should not be performed if it significantly delays surgical exploration and definitive treatment\n  Be wary of isolated abdominal pain and remember to perform a genitourinary exam. Isolated abdominal pain as the sole complaint in a male child has been shown to be significantly associated with delayed presentations (&gt;24 hours) and higher rates of orchiectomy\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nJefferies MT, Cox AC, Gupta A, Proctor A.

        "title": "Long Term Complications of Lower Urinary Tract Reconstruction",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe need for urological reconstruction is long established and the range of techniques available continues to expand. With introduction of new technology (e.g., robotic surgery) the options for achieving those techniques also looks to be expanding. The problem with all of these innovations is that whilst they are attractive (to a surgeon) and they can be made to sound attractive (to a patient) the favorable elements (e.g., reduced hospital stay, reduction in abdominal scars etc) are weighed against an influence on outcome that is not yet fully understood.\n\nThis chapter will examine some of the long-term data that have been published in relation to urological reconstruction, it will also take a brief look at some of the aspects that make our interpretation difficult including variation in technique and the incorporation of new technology.\n\nBladder\n\nThe long-term outcomes of cystoplasty are overall favorable. With good urodynamic data showing significant improvements in reservoir capacity, detrusor pressure, compliance and risk of renal damage. Kreb’s et al looked at outcomes in 29 patients with neuropathic lower urinary tract dysfunction, follow-up was14 years; an overall complication rate of 38% was observed, 6 (20.7%) had required further surgery for complications including bladder stones or small bowel obstruction. A further 8 (27.6%) required additional procedures to achieve continence (artificial urinary sphincter or transobturator tape). Long-term continence rates were 72% which is comparable to other cohorts.1 other authors have reported an improvement in quality of life.2 It is documented in the literature that urinary and fecal incontinence will adversely affect quality of life.3 In a series with more heterogenous diagnoses (including neurogenic, posterior urethral valves bladder exstrophy and cloacal exstrophy) 88.1% were continent after a mean follow-up of 12 years. 11.9% required an additional bladder neck procedure for continence, 4 (9.5%) required bladder stone removal, and ¾ suffered a subsequent recurrence. 50% had a Mitrofanoff channel for bladder drainage, and in three patients this was combined with bladder neck closure.4\n\nThe rate of cystoplasty has fallen in favor of less invasive techniques such as intravesical botulinum toxin. Ileum is the most common segment of bowel. Up to 75% will need to perform CISC (clean intermittent self catheterization). About 15% of patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction have end stage renal failure; the data support cystoplasty giving at least as good and in some studies better 10-year graft survival than an ileal conduit. Overall success varies with diagnosis but generally sits between 80 and 90%, the outcomes are less good following radiotherapy with a fall to 70%.5\n\nMetabolic disturbance is often discussed and needs to be monitored as part of follow-up.6 There is probably a subclinical hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in many patients but 16% are reported to need daily, oral bicarbonate replacement. The author’s follow-up protocol includes an annual ultrasound combined with bloods for renal function, chloride, bicarbonate, folate and vitamin B12. The reason for including vitamin B12 is that in many cases it can be difficult to determine exactly which segment of bowel had been used and thus it is safer to screen for B12 deficiency rather than assume and miss it. The consequences of the ensuing neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the cord are irreversible and allowing this to happen would be regarded as below an acceptable standard of care.5\n\nAsymptomatic bacteriuria is very common—in some studies up to 100%, significant infection is less common.7,8\n\nBladder stones are a common complication following cystoplasty. Data offer a wide range of incidences up to 39%.9 Augmentation cystoplasty results in a 2% incidence of stones, if a patient needs to catheterize urethrally, the incidence rises 5-fold and if drainage is via a Mitrofanoff, channel this rises to 10 times. This suggests that dependent drainage is favorable and the presence of residual urine increases the risk of stones.10,11 Data suggest that reduced daily fluid intake and hypocitraturia may increase the risk of stones.12 Anecdotally, mucus production may be important and this deems to increase in some diets (e.g., dairy, spicy foods).\n\nPerforation of a cystoplasty is a dangerous complication with a reported mortality approaching 25%, this probably arises as a result of delayed diagnosis in the hands of inexperienced clinicians, soft clinical signs and negative or equivocal radiology.13 The incidence is increased in neuropaths and those who catheterize and or who have undergone a surgical increase in bladder neck resistance e.g., artificial urinary sphincter or bladder neck reconstruction.14\n\nMalignancy in a cystoplasty is a distressing complication the incidence is low and estimated at 1.2% with a time lag of approximately 20 years after surgery. Tumors are most commonly found in the region of the anastomosis, they are often adenocarcinoma and may present late making curative treatment difficult. Patients who have a congenital anomaly (e.g., bladder exstrophy) of the bladder may be at increased risk when compared to others. Other risks include chronic inflammation, infection, urinary stasis, bladder stones, immunosuppression and smoking.15,16,17,18\n\nPregnancy with a cystoplasty is (as a rule) safe. If there has been previous impaired renal function it is important to ensure renal function is sufficient and the advice of a nephrologist is advisable—otherwise there is no direct effect on renal function if this was normal before conception. Those who have had a reconstruction in the face of a congenital anomaly should be monitored through pregnancy as they are at greater risk of urological complications (63%) including upper tract obstruction (10–24%), urinary retention (37%) and obstetric/gynecology complications including prolapse (exstrophy – 42%) and hypertension/preeclampsia (10–32%).19,20\n\nUreter\n\nUreteric Reimplantation for Vesicoureteric Reflux\n\nPublished data show that open and minimally invasive techniques show excellent results for surgical reimplantation of the ureter. Open reimplantation gives excellent results in a series of 965 patients, only 6.1% had persistent reflux after surgery and 72 .2% resolved within a median time of 20. 4 months, 13% suffered febrile UTIs in a median follow up period of 47.1 months.21 Smaller studies have examined minimally invasive ureteric reconstruction with robot assisted reimplants—7.7–13% had post-operative reflux initially, 10% had febrile UTIs (none of these patients had post-operative reflux recorded.22,23 Gundeti et al recognized the learning curve and development of technique over a seven year period.22 immediate post-operative complications were recorded in 10% (including ileus, ureteric injury, ureteric obstruction and a perinephric fluid collection.23 Although these data appear to show good outcomes earlier data suggested a much higher rate of UTIs (43% vs 24% F vs M) pyelonephritis (27% vs 9.5% F vs M), hypertension in 6%, 28% of women who became pregnant reports UTIs during pregnancy and 7% suffered pre-eclampsia. These data predate other studies by more than 20 years and thus improved techniques both operatively and perioperatively may have influenced later outcomes, but it is important to remember that some earlier cohorts of patients (especially) may be vulnerable to later sequelae of these types.24\n\nPyeloplasty for Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction\n\nOverall the success rate for pyeloplasty is high. Success rates of greater than 95% are cited.25 The use of a stent appears to improve the long term success (96.3% vs 91.5%).26 There are recent data that suggest a lower rate of renal preservation in patients who have associated renal anomalies.27 Many centres would offer these using a minimally invasive techniques and the outcomes appear to support this approach.\n\nUrethra\n\nEpispadias/Hypospadias\n\nEven in the best hands and high-volume centres, outcomes of hypospadias range from 5–10% for distal repairs, whereas in cases of proximal repair the incidence can range from 15% to as high as 90%.28,29,30 Recent data, examining single stage repairs for proximal hypospadias, showed an overall 56% complication rate with an increased risk of unplanned procedures and at least 2 complications (33%) when measured against a two-stage repair.31 Each subsequent redo urethroplasty carries with it a higher risk of complication.32\n\nThe most common complications are:33,34,35\n\nA. Wound dehiscence\n\nThis is an early complication and may occur in any repair but is more common in patients with proximal hypospadias. It is also seen where there is any kind of tension on the repair—i.e., if the glans is small. If the closure fails and the urethra dehisces a revision repair is needed.\n\nB. Fistula\n\nOccurring in 4–50% of patients, this is the most common complication following hypospadias repair. An early fistula probably represents a technical failure and may need time to mature before closure. Fistulae may occur at any time and any age following repair—much later fistulae need to be examine to consider a distal stricture causing a blow-out fistula.\n\nC. Diverticulae\n\nThis term describes a dilated, sacculated section of the previous repair, as with fistula it may arise with distal obstruction causing ‘back pressure’ and distension of the more proximal neourethra. Absence or deficiency corpus spongiosum tissue may be an additional factor. They may present with ventral penile swelling during voiding, poor urinary stream, postvoid dribbling, urinary tract infections and (occasionally) urethral calculi secondary to stasis. Surgical intervention requires treatment of any underlying cause e.g., distal stricture, excision of the excess tissue (wall of the diverticulum) and reclosure of the urethra.\n\nHypospadias surgery can be technically challenging, the added difficulty is that it is impossible to follow every infant hypospadias into adult life—many patients don’t need to be seen unless they have a problem after the first couple of years and we tried to follow them all the workload would crush any healthcare system. Rynja et al examined reported data for 1027 patients—180 had severe hypospadias they required an average of 2.7 operations per patient.36 The authors recognized the very high lost to follow-up rate. Data from Ghent showed a 24.1% reoperation rate in 543 prospective followed patients.37\n\nD. Meatal stenosis\n\nMeatal stenosis (defined as &lt;8 Fr caliber) may occur in the following scenarios: inadequate mobilization of the glans wrap, tubularization of the neourethra extending too far towards the glans tip or ischemia of the glans flaps. Patients may present with voiding difficulty, urine infection (from incomplete emptying), a narrowed urinary stream or spraying.\n\nE. Persistent Chordee\n\nThis is something more commonly seen in patients after they have passed through puberty. If the chordee is severe enough to prevent penetrative intercourse then correct should be offered.\n\nReported data for men who have had hypospadias surgery in childhood and thus passed through puberty is less common but very important for the overall picture. Common complaints are:\n\n\n  spraying (10–63%),\n  post void dribbling (20–40%),\n  lower urinary tract symptoms (3–85%).\n\n\nPatient dissatisfaction with outcome is increasingly recognized with a reported rate of 7–81%, data quality appears to vary between studies—this may (in part) explain the variance. Broadly speaking proximal hypospadias appears to be associated with a greater chance of long-term outcome dissatisfaction. There may be in impact on sexual function, 77–100% of men expressed good sexual satisfaction, however factors such as recurrent chordee (5–23%), erectile dysfunction (0–73%) and ejaculatory difficulties (5–36%) may impact long term sexual function.38 These data were collated and examined for the recent European Consultation looking at Congenital Lifelong Urology.\n\nExstrophy/Epispadias\n\nIt is arguably controversial to cohort all exstrophy and epispadias together as the spectrum is wide. Epispadias may be a relatively mild epispadic urethral meatus, through to a more severe form affecting the integrity of the bladder neck. Outcomes in bladder exstrophy may be affected by a range of factors—bladder plate size, diastasis, corporal mass etc. The spectrum is further widened with cloacal exstrophy and the anatomical severity inherent in that along with additional factors that may include a neuropathic element.\n\nIn this section, the urethral outcomes are the focus— other aspects will be discussed in relation sexual and fertility outcomes.\n\nIn patients with epispadias the data relating to urethroplasty are (perhaps) most pure. In a series of 30 patients, 17% required a skin revision—20% had fistulae (although this fell to 6% in patients who had undergone a Mitchell repair), abscess 3% and diverticulum 3%. 89% expressed concern about their penile appearance, one required corporeal plication for dorsal chordee and one patient underwent a forearm flap phalloplasty.39 Long term data for patients with exstrophy suggest urinary diversion in 52–70%, in one study 30% were emptying per urethra only one was voiding spontaneously, 42% suffered moderate to severe incontinence.40,41 Ejaculatory function is reported in 82–85% of men, other factors such as orgasmic dysfunction (22–51%) and reduced sensation (26–36%) were also reported.40,42\n\nGenitalia\n\nIn our surgical generation, one of the areas that has elicited some of the most active debate and discussion is that of genital reconstruction in patients with differences in sex development (DSD). There are a number of elements to the debate, these include:\n\n\n  who should make the decision for surgery\n  when should surgery be performed\n  who can consent for such surgery\n  how do we measure outcomes\n  how do we use outcome data to inform future parents/patients and surgeons.\n\n\nIt is important to understand the potential indications for surgery:\n\n\n  The creation of a (neo) vagina as a conduit for menstruation\n  The creation of a (neo) vagina to allow penetrative intercourse\n  Cosmetic improvement of genital appearance\n  Improvement of psychological wellbeing.\n  Removal of gonads to manage malignant risk\n\n\nThe Chicago consensus meeting and subsequent document, published in 2006, was clear that there should be a reduction in infant clitoroplasty.43 Until recently data suggested that this change was slow to take effect, however, comparison of outcomes suggested that outcomes may be improving, although equal numbers of patients were requiring revision surgery, the procedures needed were (surgically) minor as opposed to major interventions, it appeared that bowel vaginoplasty in childhood had poor outcomes.44\n\nThere remain a paucity of data to support the assertion that surgery will lead to improved psychological outcomes and it would be impossible to run a controlled trial to examine whether the changes the reduced sensation45 experienced in older patients is an effect of surgery or an underlying disorder.\n\nA recent large European study surveyed patients views and suggested that decisions to operate remain finely balanced. There was a tendency amongst those with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), hypospadias and XY DSD to favor early surgery—this reached significance in the CAH identifying as female group when asked to agree or disagree with the statement ‘Reduction of an enlarged clitoris is necessary in girls’—even then 39% either disagreed, were undecided or did not know. However, there is considerable variation amongst the groups. Patients who had recent contact with support groups were more likely to favor surgery at a later age. Importantly, the authors conclude that a moratorium on surgery is not justified as it does not appear to reflect the views of many patients with DSD. It is clear that multidisciplinary care is vital. A continued emphasis on gathering data for long term outcomes, ensuring informed consent/assent are important and where there is not a clear surgical indication to proceed with surgery that attempts are made to ‘motivate parents to postpone elective genital surgery.46\n\nAn in-depth discussion around DSD and outcomes is beyond the scope of this chapter. It is important that practitioners in this area are aware of the discussions, actively seek up to date information regarding outcomes and work within a multidisciplinary team to ensure the best outcome for a patient and their family.\n\nSexual Function and Fertility\n\nThese are important aspects of life for many patients that have had surgical treatment of congenital anomalies however the outcomes vary significantly with the underlying diagnosis and potentially the impact of surgery.\n\nFemale\n\nSpina Bifida\n\nAdolescents (of both sexes) with spina bifida have the normal desires and ambitions for relationships and potentially family. The subject is often noted as being poorly handled by healthcare providers. Knowledge in the area and making sure that the conversation is initiated and ongoing education are very important.47 Questions about sexual health, contraception and factors such as latex allergy (with reference to barrier contraception) are important to include.48 These young female patients tend to reach menarche earlier than their age matched counterparts. A range of factors can influence sexual debut and on-going sexual behavior including social isolation, continence, age and level of lesion. Proactive advice about supplementation with high dose folic acid in preparation for conception and in the first trimester to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in children are very important.49\n\nGenitourinary Anomalies\n\nFemale patients with bladder exstrophy may have some initial difficulty with penetrative sexual intercourse because of vaginal stenosis and dyspareunia however 80–90% report sexual activity.50,51 In those affected by a cloacal anomaly the initial length of the common channel is significant, the reconstructive surgery in longer channels is much more challenging; bringing with it a greater risk of impact on urinary, bowel and sexual function.52 Others with an absence of the vagina or with a significant deficit need to be treated in a multidisciplinary team that can offer all options—including dilatation (which is highly successful in those with a dimple and an unoperated perineum).\n\nThe aforementioned discussion regarding differences of sex development highlights some of the concern and difficulties that accompany the management of affected patients. Previously published data have shown reduced sensation in these patients and an impact on sexual and orgasmic sensation.46,45 The big questions remain—when the surgery is done—why is it necessary, what will it achieve and is now the best time to do it? All ‘sides’ of the discussion need to remain involved and open minded to ensure that the best possible outcome is achieved allow the best possible future care for the new patients (and parents) coming into the system.\n\nMale\n\nSpina Bifida\n\nAffected men have reduced penile sensation and approximately 75% will describe erectile dysfunction—this can be readily treated with phosphodiesterase inhibitors with an 80% success rate.53 Erectile function, paternity rates and mobility are all affected by the level of the lesion (with those above T10 suffering the most severe impact).54 The use of electro ejaculation is one means to assist with fertility, however despite the vast majority of men showing a normal hormonal profile many demonstrate poor semen parameters. Affected men should also be advised to take high dose folic acid as part of planned conception as there is now evidence that this will reduce their chance of having children affected by neural tube defects.55\n\nBeing in a stable relationship appears to improve overall satisfaction, approximately 50% of men affected by spina bifida report being satisfied with their sex life.56\n\nUnderstanding the diagnosis and their prior surgery are part of a good care plan for any of these patients but ensuring that there is a conversation about relationships and sex life is important. In this group (and others) urinary and fecal continence may also play an important part in their confidence and well-being in this realm. Some patients will respond well to a message that the conversation is open for them to pick up and some will require much more proactive enquiry—good communication around this is very important particularly in a patient’s adolescent life, when these issues may be associated with large elements of self-doubt.57\n\nGenitourinary Anomalies\n\nIt is perfectly normal for adolescent women and men to examine their body image and in this context to think about sexual function and whether they will satisfy a partner. Unfortunately, some of the factors that influence them are difficult to control. The most immediate of these is peer pressure/comparison; this may form part of the barriers to engagement in intimate relationships with fear of discovery, pseudo acceptance or bullying.58,59\n\nThere are some clear, anatomical issues that may make penetrative intercourse painful or very difficult (e.g., residual chordee in hypospadias or marked dorsal chordee in exstrophy).42,36 In some men with severe hypospadias or a lack of or asymmetrical corporeal tissue in exstrophy there are significant concerns about penile size. In studies that have looked specifically at micropenis 95% of patients described normal erections, with 60% having regular sexual intercourse—38% were noted to need psychological support.60 Whilst these data are not specific to either hypospadias or exstrophy they do give a strong indication of the difficulties that these patients may face and the need to incorporate psychology into their management. Data highlighting some of the areas of sexual dysfunction in men with exstrophy and hypospadias are outlined in (Table 1) This table is not designed to draw comparison but highlight the similarity in issues that arise and the need for awareness in the clinic setting.\n\nTable 1 Outline of areas of sexual dysfunction in hypospadias and exstrophy.36,38,42,59\n\n\n  \n    \n      Hypospadias issue\n      Rate\n      Exstrophy issue\n      Rate\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Curvature\n      20–30%\n      —\n      —\n    \n    \n      Erectile dysfunction\n      8.7–73%\n      Erectile dysfunction/chordee\n      13–49%\n    \n    \n      Ejaculatory dysfunction\n      24.1–36%\n      Ejaculatory dysfunction\n      15–74%\n    \n    \n      Penile appearance (dissatisfaction)\n      20.2–33.5%\n      Penile appearance (dissatisfaction)\n      23–100\n    \n    \n      Sexual satisfaction\n      81.4–100%\n      Sexual satisfaction\n      Up to 92%\n    \n  \n\n\nAs with female sexual function, many authors have highlighted important data examining these very important concerns. These sections are, by no means, comprehensive.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis chapter summarizes data relating to pediatric urology and the outcomes that relate to an underlying condition and the treatment required to manage it. Each condition and each aspect of follow-up has been explored by a range of authors in much more depth than is possible here. The range of publications below will offer the reader a starting point to review further detail as they wish.\n\nThe range of concerns that may be faced by some of these patients is considerable. Over a lifetime many patients enjoy a good quality of life and very successful outcomes. However, the background of a chronic condition and altered anatomy should not be forgotten – the potential sequelae including urinary tract infection, renal impairment, bladder stones and sexual dysfunction necessitate long term follow-up with a team that understand a patient’s background and can maintain an appropriate regime to detect these concerns when they arise. A multidisciplinary approach is important for many with colleagues from a range of specialties playing parallel roles (e.g., gynecology, radiology, nephrology, gastro/colorectal, endocrinology and genetics).\n\nThe long-term care of these patients means they form close bonds with their healthcare team, continuity and consistency are very important in aiming to provide the best possible service.\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Woodhouse CRJ.

        "title": "Role of Transitional Urology",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe transitional urologist is charged with the care of pediatric urology patients as they progress to adult care. While the disease processes that compose transitional urology (Table 1) are themselves rare, they collectively amount to a significant burden. An estimated 3,573 babies were born in the United States in 2012 with spina bifida (2,765), posterior urethral valves (PUV, 493), bladder exstrophy (118), or cloacal anomalies (197).1 At the time of this writing, these patients are approaching adolescence and recent dramatic advances in the diagnosis and care of congenital urogenital anomalies and spinal dysraphism means that they will do so with unprecedented success. In the coming years, they will require transitional urologic care.\n\nTable 1 Conditions that may be seen by the transitional urologist.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Conditions\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Neurogenic Bowel and Bladder\n    \n    \n          Spina Bifida, Cerebral Palsy, Spinal Cord Injury, CNS Tumors\n    \n    \n      Bladder Exstrophy and Epispadias\n    \n    \n      Cloacal Anomalies\n    \n    \n      Prune Belly Syndrome\n    \n    \n      Posterior Urethral Valves\n    \n    \n      Vesicoureteral Reflux\n    \n    \n      Hypospadias\n    \n    \n      Intersex Conditions\n    \n    \n      Pediatric Urologic Cancer and Survivorship\n    \n    \n      Stone Disease\n    \n  \n\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to define the role of the transitional urologist by discussing many of the issues that become or remain prominent as patients with congenital genitourinary disorders progress to adolescence and adulthood.\n\nRenal Preservation\n\nRenal preservation is a challenge common to many transitional urology patients. This section will focus on the representative cases of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), in particular posterior urethral valves (PUV), as well as neurogenic bladder dysfunction.\n\nCAKUT\n\nCAKUT represents the leading cause of both chronic and end stage kidney disease in pediatric patients.2 A comparison of CAKUT patients with age-matched patients undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) for other renal disorders observed from 1990-2009 in a large European registry found that CAKUT patients initiated RRT at a median age of 31 years, versus 61 in controls.3 In the CAKUT cohort, the incidence of RRT initiation peaked between ages 15 and 19 years, supporting other data demonstrating that the renal function of CAKUT patients typically improves in infancy and remains stable until puberty, when decline is common.\n\nIn a report of adolescent and adult patients with both primary vesicoureteral reflux and renal dysplasia as well as obstructive uropathy and secondary dysplasia, Neild and colleagues observed that, while the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is significant in CAKUT patients, the rate of loss of function in these patients is slower than that seen in peers with other forms of CKD.4,5 When progression of CKD was defined as -1.10 mL/min per year or greater, half of all CAKUT patients with eGFR of 50-60 mL/min and one-third of those with eGFR of 30-50 mL/min were found to be non-progressors. Faster rates of decline were seen in those with lower starting eGFR. Proteinuria was a significant indicator of progressive renal failure, while minimal loss of function was seen when proteinuria was limited.\n\nPosterior Urethral Valves\n\nConsistent with these findings, renal deterioration in PUV is understood to be a progressive, irreversible process set in motion in utero. In recent retrospective data with long term follow-up, between 30 and 50 percent of PUV patients developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by adulthood.6,7,8 In addition to performing routine surveillance of renal function and proteinuria, it is important to recognize that bladder dynamics change as these patients age. Significant changes in urination or continence or the finding of worsening or new hydronephrosis warrant evaluation with urodynamic studies (UDS).9,10 Following childhood management aimed at relieving obstruction, improving bladder compliance, and minimizing detrusor instability, adolescent PUV patients will commonly develop a combination of a poorly compliant, thick-walled bladder, impaired sensation of fullness, incomplete bladder emptying, upper tract dilatation, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus referred to as “valve bladder syndrome.” Myogenic detrusor failure (decreased contractility and increased capacity) may follow this, indicated by increased post-void residual bladder volumes, new or worsening incontinence, or worsening dilatation of the upper tracts.\n\nIn light of this dynamic picture, management of PUV patients in the transitional period is dependent upon the state of bladder dysfunction. Patients with any combination of polyuria, poor compliance, and hypocontractility may benefit from double voiding, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), overnight catheter drainage and, in certain cases, anticholinergic medications. Those with persistent outlet obstruction may benefit from alpha-adrenergic antagonists or require re-resection. When vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) persists in spite of appropriate management of the bladder and bladder outlet, anti-reflux surgery may be considered, understanding that these procedures are generally less successful in patients with dysfunctional bladders.11\n\nNeurogenic Bladder Dysfunction\n\nNeurogenic bladder dysfunction resulting from conditions like spina bifida represents another common etiology of renal deterioration throughout the transitional period and into adulthood. Despite the fact that most spina bifida patients are born with normal renal function, about 26% will have some degree of renal impairment by adulthood.12 This process of continuous renal deterioration coincides with changes in bladder dynamics that extend beyond childhood. In a retrospective series of 37 spina bifida patients, Almodhen and colleagues found that, following puberty, patients experienced significant urodynamic changes including increases in cystometric bladder capacity and compliance, as well as increases in maximum detrusor pressure and detrusor leak point pressure.13 These changes are theorized to have neurogenic (resulting from spinal cord tethering), anatomic (due to increasing outlet resistant resulting from prostatic growth or estrogenization of the female urethra), and/or behavioral (related to poor compliance with CIC) causes. While rates of VUR and hydronephrosis were not significantly different between the pre- and post-pubertal periods, it is important to recognize that these parameters change and, in the case of increased maximum detrusor pressure and detrusor leak point pressure, may result in transmission of high pressures to the upper tract and associated renal deterioration.\n\nIn light of the concern for ongoing renal decline in these patients, the Spina Bifida Association (SBA) recommends annual surveillance with serum creatinine and renal-bladder ultrasound for adolescent and adult patients, as well as serum chemistries including B12 for those who have undergone urinary reconstruction. For immobile patients with low muscle mass, an alternative measure of renal function such as cystatin C or nuclear medicine eGFR should be assessed.14,15 This is supported by the 2019 European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society for Pediatric Urology (ESPU) guidelines for the management of neurogenic bladder in children and adolescents.16 The appropriate use of UDS in the transitional period is more controversial. The SBA makes no formal recommendations for the use of UDS, though some experts from high volume centers have individually recommended obtaining UDS at the beginning of the transitional period and/or for cause in the setting of recurrent UTIs, bladder pain, or new or worsening incontinence or upper tract dilatation thereafter.17,18 The EAU/ESPU guidelines suggest more regular screening with biannual UDS in adolescence and adulthood.\n\nThe mainstays of management of neurogenic high-pressure voiding in the transitional patient are similar to those recommended in childhood, including CIC, anticholinergic medications and, in cases refractory to medication, intradetrusor botulinum toxin A (Botox) injection. While all are generally low risk, each carries side effects to consider. Chronic CIC increases the risk of bladder or urethral trauma and resultant urethral stricture, perforation, or meatal stenosis. Furthermore, colonization of the urinary tract puts CIC patients at increased risk not only for UTIs, but also for overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and resultant multi-drug resistance, drug-related side-effects, and opportunistic infections.19,20 Anticholinergic medications have been shown to reliably reduce detrusor overactivity and decrease intravesical pressure21,22 and their use in pediatric neurogenic patients is broadly supported.14,16 Beta-3-adrenergic agonists have the advantage of eliminating anticholinergic side-effects and are commonly used as both alternatives and adjuncts to anticholinergics, though published clinical experience remains limited. Botox injection every 6-12 months may be considered in cases refractory to medications. Clinical experience suggests that Botox is most effective in suppressing detrusor overactivity and may be less effective when poor compliance is the primary issue.23,24\n\nPatients who fail or are otherwise unfit for conservative management of high-pressure voiding may be candidates for augmentation cystoplasty, which carries the benefit of both increasing surface area and decreasing contractility in the bladder. The use of bowel segments carries with it the risk of numerous complications (Table 2), including metabolic disarray, UTIs, reservoir stones, bowel obstruction, and malignancy. Furthermore, augmented bladders and pouches are susceptible to perforation, which can result from overdistension or direct puncture with a catheter. Perforation is a life-threatening emergency, presenting spontaneously in 8.6% of patients in a large retrospective series of 500 cases of bladder augmentation reviewed by Metcalfe and colleagues.25 In this group, roughly one-third of perforations occurred within 2 years of surgery, another third between post-operative years 2 and 6, and the final third more than 6 years following augmentation. While increased risk of perforation has traditionally been attributed to numerous clinical variables including choice of bowel segment, bladder neck closure, and ischemic injury to the augment, a 2016 analysis of transitional and adult bladder augmentation patients found that spontaneous bladder rupture occurred at a significantly higher rate (22%) in patients with a history of alcohol abuse and/or noncompliance versus peers with neither of these risk factors (2%).26\n\nTable 2 Complications of enterocystoplasty.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Complications\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Urinary Tract Infections\n    \n    \n      Urinary Tract Calculi\n    \n    \n      Metabolic Disarray\n    \n    \n      Bowel Obstruction\n    \n    \n      Diarrhea and Gastrointestinal Malabsorption\n    \n    \n      Bladder Perforation\n    \n    \n      Channel Stenosis, Stricture, or False Passage\n    \n    \n      New Urinary Incontinence\n    \n    \n      Malignancy of Bowel or Bladder\n    \n  \n\n\nVoiding and Continence\n\nThe scope of voiding dysfunction in the transitional patient is broad, including structural (PUV) and neurogenic (detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia) bladder outlet obstruction; congenital anomalies of the bladder, bladder neck, or urethral sphincter (prune belly syndrome, bladder exstrophy, cloacal malformations); and abnormal smooth muscle function, whether primarily neurogenic or resulting from trauma, stones, infections, or previous treatments or surgeries.\n\nA multicenter retrospective study of over 400 adolescent or adult spina bifida patients found that 66% experienced urinary incontinence, with 40% having either continuous or frequent leakage.27 In 2017, a group from the University of Indiana reported the results of a large survey study finding urinary incontinence to be a significant independent predictor of lower health related quality of life (HRQOL) in adult spina bifida patients, with increasing amount of urinary incontinence associated with worse HRQOL.28\n\nManagement of urinary incontinence in the transitional patient may be tailored depending on the etiology. If high end fill pressures are the primary driver of incontinence, as may be the case in both congenital outlet resistance like PUV as well as various forms of neurogenic bladder dysfunction, methods aimed at improving bladder compliance and capacity (as detailed in the previous section) may alone be effective. Of note, given that bladder dysfunction resulting from PUV is dynamic and often ends with a capacious, hypotonic bladder, augmentation is less commonly advisable in this population.\n\nIf incontinence is attributable primarily to an incompetent bladder outlet, this may be addressed with surgery of the bladder neck, whether it be a formal reconstruction, sling procedure, artificial urinary sphincter placement, or instillation of bulking agents. It is critical to note that treating incontinence in spina bifida patients introduces the risk of unmasking high voiding pressures and VUR, even in patients for whom this was not previously detected.29 For this reason, concomitant bladder augmentation is advisable when performing procedures to increase bladder outlet resistance, except in carefully selected patients who are counseled preoperatively on the need for close postoperative follow-up and potential need for a delayed augmentation.\n\nFinally, catheterizable channels often benefit this patient population—in cases of immobile female patients for whom urethral catheterization is challenging as well as in patients for whom a previous anti-incontinence procedure precludes catheterization per urethra. These surgeries are increasingly complex as patients age; obesity and prior surgeries limit choices for bowel segments and increase the likelihood of complications.30,31\n\nPregnancy\n\nPregnancy poses a number of unique challenges to transitional urology patients, particularly those with reconstructed or augmented urinary tracts. Ideally, patients should be counseled on this prior to becoming pregnant. Patients with enterocystoplasties should be made aware that urine HCG tests may be falsely positive up to 57% of the time, likely attributable to reservoir mucous and enzymes reacting with the testing reagent.32,33 These patients should therefore use serum HCG tests to minimize false positives. Patients with preexisting renal dysfunction are at greater risk for numerous pregnancy complications including accelerated loss of renal function and should be counseled on this.34 If and when pregnant, these patients’ renal function should be closely monitored. Patients with solitary kidney in particular should be aware of the increased risk of nephrolithiasis in pregnancy. Obstruction should be considered early in the evaluation of kidney injury in these pregnant patients.\n\nThe mass effect from the gravid uterus itself may challenge the vascular supply to a bowel augment, obstruct reimplanted ureters or catheterizable channels, or lead to bowel obstruction, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt compression, urostomy stenosis or prolapse, or a parastomal hernia. In patients without bladder neck closure, the attendant shift in pelvic anatomy may lead to de novo or worsening urinary incontinence.\n\nPregnancy is associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) in all patients. This is especially true of reconstructed patients who, on top of a baseline elevated UTI risk, must contend in pregnancy with increased mucous secretions and potential difficulty with catheterization. It is not uncommon that these patients require continuous urinary drainage at some point during pregnancy due to inability to catheterize.35 Patients with a reconstructed urinary tract, particularly those involving bowel segments, are at increased risk of pyelonephritis during pregnancy,36,37 which can lead to preterm labor, fetal loss, or fetal growth impairment.\n\nDelivery\n\nThere are special considerations for both vaginal delivery and Cesarean section (C-section) in many transitional urology patients.\n\nIn order to be eligible for vaginal delivery, bony and muscular anatomy, which is often altered in patients with spina bifida and other congenital anomalies, must permit adequate hip abduction and room for fetal transit through the pelvis. Furthermore, patients with spinal dysraphism must be able to generate the coordinated muscular contraction necessary for pushing in the later stages of delivery.37 Finally, patients with a history of anti-incontinence surgery or bladder neck reconstruction should be made aware that a prolonged vaginal delivery poses a risk of injury to pelvic floor support and continence mechanisms. Should these patients pursue vaginal delivery, prolonged labor should be avoided if this can be accomplished safely.\n\nC-section in patients with enterocystoplasties must be carefully planned and a surgeon familiar with the reconstructed anatomy must be accessible in case of any injury to the reconstructed bladder or its vascular supply. In a series of pregnant patients with prior urinary reconstruction, Hensle and colleagues report that C-section via a midline incision routinely permitted distraction of the reservoir or augmented bladder towards the area of bowel harvest and safely away from the gravid uterus.35 A midline incision is therefore traditionally recommended, though a recent series of female exstrophy patients from Dy and colleagues at the University of Washington reported that using a classical vertical uterine incision with a paramedian skin incision contralateral to the stoma was also routinely successful.38 Finally, the presence of a VP shunt should be considered a reason to avoid C-section unless otherwise necessary, given the risk of shunt infection associated with abdominal surgery.37\n\nUrinary Tract Calculi\n\nThe transitional urological patient may have a number of risk factors for developing urinary tract stones that are attributable to both the reconstructed urinary tract and associated comorbidities. Urinary retention, VUR, and the use of catheters with attendant increased UTI rates are all associated with heightened stone formation. Patients with reconstructed urinary tracts experience urinary stasis while enteric segments contribute mucous, which, along with sutures and staples, may serve as a nidus for stones. These patients are also at greater risk for enteric hyperoxaluria given prior bowel resection.\n\nSpina bifida patients may be particularly susceptible to stone disease throughout the urinary tract due to sequelae of immobility – namely bone resorption causing hypercalciuria and obesity leading to urinary acidosis. Spina bifida patients with sensory deficits who develop obstructing stones may present with atypical symptoms such as headaches, nausea, or autonomic dysreflexia, or may have no symptoms at all prior to developing sepsis or renal injury. Similarly, an obstructing stone in a patient with a renal transplant may present only as diminished urine output. It is thus necessary to have a high index of suspicion for obstructing stones in these patients.\n\nWork-Up and Medical Management\n\nAs with all pediatric patients, transitional patients who develop urinary tract stones warrant evaluation with 24-hour urine collection. Preliminary recommendations may nonetheless be made based on the predisposing condition. Patients with colonized urinary tracts are more likely to develop infection-related stones (struvite, carbonate apatite, or calcium phosphate); immobile patients are at risk of calcium-based stone formation resulting from osteodystrophy and uric acid stones relating to obesity; and those with bowel augments or pouches are at increased risk of developing enteric hyperoxaluria.39,40,41\n\nThe role of thiazide diuretics, prophylactic antibiotics, allopurinol, and alkalinizing agents in minimizing stone formation may be extrapolated from literature pertaining to the general population, though have not been rigorously evaluated in transitional patients who suffer from dysfunctional voiding and/or have undergone bladder augmentation. The use of regular high volume (≥240mL) irrigation has been shown in at least two clinical series to reduce bladder stone recurrence in patients with augmentation cystoplasties. Hensle and colleagues advised a regimen of twice weekly irrigation with saline and once weekly with gentamycin, while the Husman group used daily saline irrigations.26,42\n\nSurgical Management\n\nUrolithiasis is among the most common indications for surgery in transitional urology patients.17,18 When it comes to surgical management of stones, transitional urology patients typically require additional consideration and, in many cases, multiple surgeries in order to become stone-free. Positioning and access may be challenged by contracture, musculoskeletal deformities, and obesity. Furthermore, in susceptible patients, autonomic dysreflexia must be considered a significant risk with any procedure involving filling or instrumenting the urinary tract.\n\nPatients who experience urinary stasis, recurrent UTIs, and/or have urinary tracts including bowel segments are disproportionately susceptible to lower tract stones.41,43 In operating for lower tract stones, percutaneous and open approaches have been favored for patients with a history of bladder neck closure or reconstruction for whom urethral access is either impossible or ill-advised, as well as those with large stones. Instrumenting the catheterizable channel in these patients is not recommended in order to avoid damaging the continence mechanism. Current data generally support a percutaneous approach in all but extenuating circumstances, given comparable recurrence-free rates and favorable postoperative lengths of stay in comparison with the open approach.44,45,46\n\nCancer Surveillance\n\nPatients with urinary dysfunction are at elevated risk for developing cancer in their bladders, whether they have undergone augmentation or not. These patients experience higher rates of recurrent UTIs and bladder stones, and often have chronic indwelling catheters and/or reconstructed bladders, which are themselves risk factors for bladder and/or colon cancer.47,48 Furthermore, these patients suffer from presenting atypically and at advanced stages, likely leading to worse outcomes. Austin and colleagues reported on 8 cases of spina bifida patients treated for bladder cancer at median age of 41 years, of which just one patient had undergone augmentation cystoplasty.49 These patients commonly presented with atypical symptoms including urosepsis, renal failure, difficult catheterization, more frequent UTIs, and sterile pyuria. While the majority presented with gross hematuria, most of these patients had experienced episodes of gross hematuria in the past. At the time of diagnosis, 88% had either tumor stage 3 or greater or lymph node metastases.\n\nThe mixing of colonic and urothelial mucosa, prolonged exposure of enteric mucosa to urine and, in the case of ureterosigmoidostomies, the mixing of urine and feces have long been theorized to foster an oncogenic milieu in the reconstructed bladder. This was supported by evidence that tumors or polyps develop in as many as 41% of patients with ureterosigmoidostomies on long term follow-up,50,51,52,53 which have since mostly fallen out of favor. By comparison, Husmann and Rathbun have reported a malignancy risk (colonic and urothelial) of 1.5% per decade of life following ileocolonic augments performed for a range of etiologies of bladder dysfunction.54,55 In patients specifically with gastric cystoplasties, the risk is likely greater: 2.8% per decade, as reported by Vemulakonda and colleagues.56\n\nWith an understood increased risk of malignancy in all patients with dysfunctional bladders, the role that augmentation with bowel segments plays in amplifying this risk remains in question. In a review of over 20 years of registry data, Higuchi and colleagues compared cancer risk in patients who had undergone ileal or colonic cystoplasty for bladder dysfunction resulting from neurogenic cause, exstrophy, and PUV against that in patients matched for age, gender, and etiology of bladder disfunction who had not undergone augmentation and were managed with CIC and anticholinergic medications alone.57 They found no significant difference between these groups in bladder cancer incidence, age of diagnosis, tumor stage, mortality rate, or median survival. In all cases, cancer developing in these patients with congenital bladder anomalies presented at a younger age, with more advanced disease, and was associated with worse survival.\n\nIncreased cancer risk had led many urologists to recommend routine screening with cystoscopy and/or biopsy, and a possible role for urine cytology has also been discussed.56,58 Recent clinical experience has called into question the value of routine screening, however. In a 2011 study from the Mayo Clinic group, 250 surveillance cystoscopies over 5 years in patients 10 years post-enterocystoplasty found no malignant lesions.59 Notably, the performance of urine cytology for screening was also poor in this group, with  a specificity of 90% compared with 99% in the general population, supporting previous data suggesting that bowel segments meaningfully confound cytological analysis.60,61 Given the aggressiveness of tumors generally found in this type of patient and the low diagnostic yield of cystoscopy in this series and others,62 the authors concluded that routine cystoscopy was unlikely to detect early-stage cancer and therefore a poor screening tool. This group has instead recommended performing endoscopy only when certain criteria are met (recurrent UTIs; gross hematuria and/or greater than 50 rbc/hpf on urinalysis; bladder pain; concerning radiographic findings; or otherwise beginning at age 50 for patients with colonic augments, consistent with screening recommendations for colonoscopy). A similar recommendation is endorsed by the Spina Bifida Association 2018 guidelines, which recommend performing cystoscopy in adult patients with bladder augments in the event of clinical changes in the upper or lower urinary tracts including increasing incontinence, gross hematuria, recurrent UTIs, pelvic pain, or a renal transplant with known BK/polyomavirus.14\n\nSupporting Transition\n\nAcross fields, children with special health care needs are underserved, with only 40% receiving adequate services according to the 2009-2010 US National Survey of Children with Special Healthcare Needs.63 It is likely that transitional patients in need of genitourinary care are no exception. A 2014 study of 24 patients with neurogenic bladder or congenital genitourinary abnormalities referred to a transitional care clinic found that changes in management were required in 70.8% of cases, with surgical management required in 58.3%, indicating a staggering prevalence of undertreatment in these patients.17 In the case of spina bifida, even when patients are directed to follow up in a multidisciplinary clinic for transitional urologic care, the rate of successful transition has been demonstrated to be as low as 40%.64 Lack of insurance, under-insurance, or lapses in coverage may be accountable for as many as half of missed appointments in transitional urology patients.65\n\nThe consequences of inadequate surveillance and undertreatment in this group are substantial. In addition to the potential for major morbidity in the short- and long-term, it has been demonstrated that transitional patients with inadequate care are more likely to rely on emergency care64 and frequently require preventable hospitalization for urinary issues.66 In efforts to minimize gaps in care and maximize patient comfort and the impact of clinic visits in the transition period, a number of centers have established clinics specializing in transitional genitourinary care. Providers have described strategic clinic location64 and other best practices for transitional visits.17,18,65,67,68\n\nWhile it remains unclear which provider-related strategies are most effective in optimizing transitional care, it is now widely recognized that preparing the patient for adult life is critical to a successful transition. In addition to preparation for sexual and reproductive function and establishing continence when possible, this means enabling the patient to become the primary steward of his or her own care through education about independent living, medication management, and insurance coverage. Due to the multisystem nature of disease in transitional patients and the diversity of considerations relating to continuity of care, transitional urology is necessarily a team sport, often requiring contributions from additional providers across fields, including nephrology, endocrinology, gynecology, neurosurgery, social work, nutrition, and specialized nursing.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe role of the transitional urologist is multifaceted, including prevention of acute pathology, preservation of organ function, and enabling the progression of pediatric patients to adulthood. The establishment of best practices remains a work in progress, as clinical experience with these patients in adolescence and adulthood grows.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Close observation of patients with urologic malformations and neurogenic bladder is critical in the transitional patient to ensure preservation of renal and bladder function.\n  The presence of an enterocystoplasty puts patients at risk for numerous severe complications that may arise in the transitional period, including sepsis, bladder rupture, and malignancy.\n  Pregnancy planning in the transitional patient should consider unique maternal health risks as well as anatomic and neurologic barriers to delivery. If a C-section may be required or is preferred, this should be planned with careful consideration of the reconstructed anatomy and an expert available to assist in the event of complications.\n  Urinary tract stones and malignancy should be considered in the event of clinical changes including new or increasing incontinence, gross hematuria, recurrent UTIs, and pelvic pain in transitional patients with voiding dysfunction, particularly those who have undergone bladder augmentation.\n  Good transitional care includes not only disease prevention and management, but also preparation for adult life.\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Misseri R, Elliot SP.

        "title": "Long Term Complications of Urogential Reconstruction",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nUrogenital reconstruction is a broad description of surgeries that many of the most complex pediatric and adult urology patients have undergone. This chapter addresses the long-term considerations for adolescents and young adults (AYA) who have undergone reconstruction for urogenital (UG) sinuses, cloacal anomalies, exstrophy (including cloacal exstrophy and epispadias), and proximal hypospadias with a view to their reconstructive surgical outcomes later in life. Controversies regarding timing of reconstruction are discussed.\n\nOf note, long-term outcomes are inherently challenging to study in these complex populations because there have been such radical shifts in how we counsel and manage patients over time. For example, in bladder exstrophy, the modern staged repair became popularized in the early 1970s.1,2,3 In cloacal anomalies and UG sinuses, the posterior sagittal approach and total urethral mobilization (TUM) were published in the 1980s and 1990s.4,5 Thus, studying an adolescent and adult population today might make conclusions about outdated techniques and attitudes.\n\nAnother major limitation to the study and collation of data regarding urogenital reconstruction is that all the disease states summarized in this chapter exist on wide spectrums and are rare. For example, the complications and outcomes for a patient with a short confluence UG sinus or short common channel cloaca will likely be vastly different from a patient where the vagina and/or rectum insert into the bladder neck. Alternatively, a patient with bladder exstrophy and a large bladder plate without polyps and a narrow diastasis is vastly different from a patient with a demure plate covered in polyps and a wide diastasis. However, studies often include patients throughout a spectrum together because:\n\n\n  it can be challenging to quantify the severity of disease on an individualized basis and,\n  the number of patients in each disease state are often so small that making any meaningful conclusions requires some grouping of patients.\n\n\nRegardless, we must assess the data as they currently stand and use them to advance and improve the way we study long-term outcomes for these unique and important populations.\n\nTable 1 Summary of long-term considerations in urogenital reconstruction\n\n\n  \n    \n      UG Sinus\n      Cloacal Anomalies\n      BEEC\n      Proximal Hypospadias\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Vaginal stenosisGenital cosmesisContinenceMenstruationObstetrics\n      Vaginal stenosisGenital cosmesisContinenceMenstruationObstetricsBowel function\n      ContinencePenile reconstructionErectile/ejaculatory dysfunctionVaginal stenosisGenital cosmesisProlapseMenstruationObstetrics\n      Recurrent chordeeErectile/ejaculatory dysfunctionComplications (fistulae, stricture, diverticulae)Genital cosmesis\n    \n  \n\n\nUrogenital\n\nFor females with a UG sinus secondary to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and those with a pure UG sinus, repair of the UG sinus may be performed in infancy. Controversies surrounding the timing of repair and concomitant feminizing genitoplasty are discussed in a later section. This section assumes a UG sinus repair was performed and will discuss the associated long-term outcomes and complications.\n\nPatients with short confluences measured on endoscopy may be managed simply with a skin-flap (Fortunoff) introitoplasty. For those with longer confluences in which more mobilization is required, options include total urogenital sinus mobilization (TUM), partial urogenital sinus mobilization (PUM), or vaginal pull through with the common channel used as urethra. TUM involves radical dissection of the entire UG sinus circumferentially with division of the pubourethral ligaments to allow for greater mobilization. PUM aims to preserve the pubourethral ligaments. Regardless, the surgical approach, is to mobilize as little as necessary, balanced against the need to achieve a tension free closure to the perineum. In both cases, mobilized sinus tissue can be used to recreate a mucosa-lined vestibule.\n\nIn patients best served with a vaginal pull through and use of the common channel as the urethra, continence may be compromised as the true urethra and continence mechanism may be short and underdeveloped. TUM similarly can cause incontinence and a neurogenic component due to the radical mobilization required. Often a bladder neck surgery (sling, reconstruction, or transection) will be required to achieve continence. Urethrovaginal fistulas are a dreaded complication of vaginal pull through repair, the true incidence of these in the long-term is unknown. When minimal mobilization occurs as with patients undergoing a posterior channel mobilization or PUM, AYA tend to have excellent continence outcomes.6,7\n\nNeonatally performed vaginoplasty, for UG sinus repair, has a high rate of stenosis (25-100%) that will often require a secondary introitoplasty at puberty.8,9,10 These tend to be relatively simple procedures that heal well, with patient participation in postoperative dilation. After feminizing genitoplasty, sexual and psychological outcomes are grossly understudied despite the significant controversy that exists today.\n\nCloacal Anomalies\n\nUrogenital reconstruction in infancy for females with cloacal anomalies vary greatly depending on the length of common channel and where the vagina and rectum insert into the urethra. Most commonly, patients undergo a posterior sagittal anorecto-vagino-urethroplasty (PSARVUP) with or without UG sinus mobilization. As previously discussed, a TUM or PUM may be employed depending on where the vagina inserts into the urethra and thus, how much mobilization is needed to bring two separate orifices to the perineum. If the vagina enters near the bladder neck, a vaginal pull through might be considered and the common channel used as the urethra. Vaginal replacement with bowel can be considered where there is insufficient vaginal length or vaginal atresia.\n\nIn the long-term, a high suspicion for neurogenic bladder should be maintained throughout the AYA period. Radical mobilization during surgery is thought to lead to neuropraxia that often occurs early, but late presentations are always possible. Overall, 80-91% of adult females a history of cloacal anomaly, achieve social continence and 49-67% will require clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), either via urethra or through a continent catheterizable channel.11,12,13\n\nAbout 22-36% of females will present at puberty with obstructed menstruation due to introital stenosis after infant vaginoplasty.14,15 If a vagina of adequate length is present, a skin-flap introitoplasty or buccal mucosa grafting are possible treatment options. If a suitable vaginoplasty was never accomplished in infancy, other options such as a bowel vaginoplasty, skin (McIndoe) vaginoplasty, or buccal mucosa graft vaginoplasty are all options.\n\nBladder Exstrophy Epispadias Complex\n\nLong-term complications of urogenital reconstruction after closure of epispadias, bladder or cloacal exstrophy center around urinary continence and sexual function. Unsurprisingly, the definition of “continence” is variable depending on the study and often the patient population is so heterogeneous (severity of disease, closure technique, etc.) that conclusions are difficult to make. In general, achieving continence is possible for AYA with BEEC, although additional bladder neck procedures, augmentation cystoplasty, and catheterization are routinely required to accomplish continence goals. Augmentation cystoplasty is expected in 58-70% of adults, many of whom (88-95%) also will have a bladder neck reconstruction or transection and closure to aid in continence or dryness.16,17,18 Only 14-25% of adult patients report volitional voiding per urethra.18,19\n\nPenile complications after epispadias repair include fistulae, diverticulae, need for skin revision and recurrent dorsal chordee. In a series of 30 patients with isolated epispadias, 17% required a skin revision and 20% had fistulae.20 89% expressed concern about their penile appearance, one required corporeal plication for dorsal chordee and one patient underwent a forearm flap phalloplasty. In males with bladder exstrophy, Rubenwolf et al showed a 49% incidence of dorsal chordee and 36% with reduced penile sensation.21 Neophallus creation is an option for males who have a phallus that is not suitable due to length or degree of chordee for intercourse.\n\nFor females with BEEC, sequelae following primary closure in infancy may include introital stenosis and a significant scar over the mons pubis. Roughly 25–57% of females will require some form of introitoplasty during adolescence or adulthood.22,23,24,25 Obstructed menstruation is rare in BEEC, however introitoplasty allows for use of tampons and ability to have penetrative sex. These are usually straightforward procedures: options include dilation, perineal skin-flap introitoplasty, or use of buccal mucosal grafts. The abnormal pelvic floor musculature and anterior displacement of the vagina, females with BEEC result in a high rate of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). About 30–50% of patients will have evidence of POP by age 16, regardless of parity.26,27\n\nProximal Hypospadias\n\nNotably, long-term outcomes in this population are very difficult to parse out, as many of the studies group proximal and distal hypospadias repair together. In a similar theme to the other disease states noted in this chapter, the expected difference in outcomes and complications between a subcoronal or glanular hypospadias and a perineal hypospadias with penoscrotal transposition are great. In addition, it is estimated that there are over 300 types of repair noted in the literature and the exact type utilized is rarely noted.28\n\nIn the short term, we know that single-staged repairs for proximal hypospadias estimate a 56% complication rate, with a higher risk of unplanned procedures and multiple complications when compared to a two-stage repair.29 Notably, each subsequent redo repair comes with a higher risk of complications.30 Thus for patients presenting as AYA with a continued complication from a proximal hypospadias repair, the odds of success decrease with each attempt at repair.\n\nIn general, males with a history of proximal hypospadias seem to have worse long-term outcome satisfaction when compared to males with a history of distal hypospadias. Repairs that involve more genital reconstruction appear to have a greater impact on sexual function due to recurrent chordee (5–23%), erectile dysfunction (0–73%) and ejaculatory difficulties (5–36%).31 Recurrent curvature is common in this cohort as well as dissatisfaction with penile length.32\n\nHennayake et al recently published that in a cohort of adolescents with a history of childhood one-stage proximal hypospadias repair, 39% had complications requiring operative repair.33 In this cohort, the mean HOSE score was 14.8/16 and the mean PPPS score was 17.8/18. Residual curvature was noted in a small percentage, almost 90% reported a firm glans with erection, and all patients reported normal ejaculation.\n\nIn patients requiring corporal incisions and/or grafting, resultant erectile dysfunction rates are poorly documented. A recent study suggests that a small number of patients who underwent small intestinal submucosal (SIS) corporal grafting, 5% reported moderate ED, with no difference compared to a control group.34\n\nControversy\n\nOne of the most debated and controversial topics in urology today centers around timing and consent for genital reconstruction. This has been most notable in the discussion of patients with differences in sex development (DSD), including patients with UG sinuses and proximal hypospadias. Questions such as when surgery should occur, what urogenital reconstruction is most appropriate and who decides (caregiver vs. patient) have been the major topics of debate.\n\nThe Chicago DSD consensus meeting and publication from 2006, agreed that infant clitoroplasty should be avoided.35 There are no data to support the claim that feminizing genitoplasty (namely clitoroplasty and labioplasty) confer any psychological or sexual benefit. A recent study by Bennecke et al demonstrated that views on infant genital surgery are still mixed among affected patients.36 They found that 66% of patients with CAH and 60% of those with an XY DSD thought that infancy is the appropriate age for surgery. 47% of males thought early hypospadias surgery is better. Those who had infant genital surgery were more favorable of it; conversely, patients who had recent contact with support groups were more likely to favor later surgery. The authors conclude a case-by-case shared decision-making model is better suited for the sensitive nature of infant genital surgery, rather than a blanket ban.\n\nAs stated in the introduction, these populations are an extremely heterogeneous group in infancy and as AYA. There are some decisions that are not as controversial such as mobilization of the rectum from the vagina in a patient with a cloacal anomaly or closure of the bladder in bladder exstrophy. But UG sinus mobilization in an otherwise healthy child, whether to make a neovagina in an infant knowing a revision surgery will be necessary, however, decisions around feminizing genitoplasty must be dealt with in a patient- and family-centered fashion. Caring for these patients, not only in infancy, but also into adolescence and young adulthood with a multi-disciplinary team, including medical, surgical and psychological input, is critical.\n\nConclusions\n\nData concerning long-term complications and outcomes after urogenital reconstruction have significant limitations including small sample sizes, gross heterogeneity of cohorts, and variable definitions of success. However, care for the AYA who has undergone a UG sinus, cloacal, exstrophy, or proximal hypospadias repair requires individualized management with an underlying knowledge of general principles from the literature presented in this chapter. Ultimately, multi-institutional studies of longitudinal cohorts of patients will help overcome some of the current limitations.\n\nKey Points\n\n  Understanding the balance between cosmetic improvement and functional reconstruction is very important in counseling patients or their families.\n  There are very few absolute indications for infant surgery but parental consent for genital surgery remains controversial and an individualized approach is necessary.\n  Patients should be cared for by providers working within a multidisciplinary team.\n  An understanding of the potential complications of early surgery is important for those who have undertaken the surgery and those who will care for the patient as an adolescent/adult.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCendron l., Zanotti G, Percudani R, Ramazzina I, Puggioni V, Maccacaro E, et al..

        "title": "Tissue Engineering—Current Status and Future",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nTissue engineering is the science of transplanting cells or directing regrowth of healthy cells in order to create tissues or organs that mimic the native form and function to treat a myriad of diseases.1 Tissue engineering in the field of pediatric urology has focused primarily on regenerating bladder and urethral tissue for replacement or augmentation.2,3,4 The current use of intestine for bladder replacement and augmentation pose significant risks and complications, including intestinal obstruction, metabolic derangements, stone formation, mucus production, urinary incontinence, and recurrent infections.3,4 The use of mucosal or skin grafts for urethral replacement and augmentation pose risks such as strictures, fistulas, graft failure, graft contracture, donor site morbidity, and recurrence of chordee.5,6 Tissue engineering holds promise in the effort to provide durable alternatives for children.\n\nWork in this field has progressed from growth of these tissues ex vivo to animal studies to more recent trials in a limited number of pediatric patients. While there have been significant advancements in scaffolds and cell cultures along with promising results from animal studies, there are barriers that remain which limit the application of this technology to large-scale patient use. This review will aim to summarize and present clinical results from work in tissue engineering within pediatric urology and discuss barriers and future directions in this field.\n\nBiomaterials and Cells\n\nTissue engineering principles dictate the need for a scaffold and seeded cells to populate the scaffold.7 Numerous scaffolds exist and have been used in urological tissue engineering, including acellular small intestinal submucosa (SIS), collagen, and composite collagen-polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh.2,8 Work in generating a decellularized bladder extracellular matrix (BEM) using porcine bladders has also shown success with satisfactory removal of cells and genetic material without affecting the underlying collagen or elastin structure, with preservation of angiogenic properties.9\n\nSources of seeded cells can include autologous urothelial cells and stem cells. While autologous cells can be obtained from a bladder biopsy and expanded in vitro, underlying bladder pathology is a potential limitation as cells from diseased bladders had decreased survival on cell culture compared to healthy adult bladder controls. Additionally, urothelium from bladders with pathology were shown to form weaker and less efficacious epithelial borders.10 Numerous stem cells have also been investigated, including bone marrow-derived, mesenchymal, urine-derived, embryonic, and induced pluripotent stem cells.11,12,13 The process is outlined in Figure 1.\n\n\nFigure 1 Schematic diagram of the process to harvest host cells (a), expand them in vitro and implant on a suitable tissue scaffold (b), and then implant in the body (c).\n\nVascularization of Engineered Organs\n\nSimilar to native tissue, survival of seeded cells on scaffolds is reliant on adequate vascularization. Innovations in biomaterials have allowed for creation of larger constructs which invariably exceed the diffusion limit for gases and nutrients.14 Once implanted, establishing a vascular network may take weeks, depending on the size of the graft, during which time transplanted cells may experience hypoxia and/or nutrient deficiencies. Furthermore, the process of angiogenesis can result in formation of oxygen and/or nutrient gradients that preferentially support growth of superficial cells and may result in non-uniform growth of matrices and potential structural weakness.15 Strategies to overcome the size constraints of tissue engineered organs include: pre-vascularization of scaffolds prior to cell seeding, seeding of scaffolds with both transplant and endothelial cells, and addition of angiogenic factors prior to graft implantation.16 Another option that has shown potential is the use of an omental wrap over implanted bladder tissue to serve as a vascular pedicle; the functional capacity of these grafts can arguably be seen as a proxy for cell survival and function.17 However, this latter option is not feasible for implanted matrices outside the reach of omentum. Additional work is necessary to address this matter of vascular viability of engineered tissue, especially with goals for whole-organ regeneration.\n\nAnimal and Human Studies in Bladder Tissue Engineering\n\nPrevious animal studies in bladder regeneration have shown encouraging results with use of unseeded scaffolds alone. Caione et al studied the use of an SIS scaffold for bladder regrowth in a porcine model of partial cystectomy. 40-60% of the bladder wall of six piglets were removed and replaced with an SIS scaffold. Blood vessels were noted to be migrating from native bladders into the graft five weeks after surgery. Histologic examination of the graft after three months demonstrated transitional epithelium, smooth muscle, and nerves. Grafts had a collagen:smooth muscle ratio of 72:28 compared to 56:44 in native bladders, consistent with an absence of increased bladder capacity and compliance in all animals.18 In a later study by Roelofs et al, they compared the use of collagen scaffolds for bladder augmentation in a sheep model of bladder exstrophy versus healthy sheep bladder. At the one-month postoperative timepoint, bladders of lambs with exstrophy had lower capacity and compliance compared to augmented healthy bladders. Additionally, bladder grafts from healthy controls had more neovascularization and smooth muscle present compared to grafts from lambs with bladder exstrophy. At the six-month postoperative mark, bladder volumes were similar between the two but compliance remained lower in the exstrophy model; meanwhile regenerated bladders had similar urothelium with nerve regrowth in both groups.19 The early postoperative results corroborate in vitro studies of impaired regeneration in bladders with underlying pathology, however the six-month postoperative findings may be a reassuring sign of longer term potential, although there are limited studies to substantiate this.10\n\nEmboldened by initial successes in animal studies, pilot studies in a limited number of children have been performed to evaluate use of both cell-seeded and unseeded scaffolds for bladder regeneration. Caione et al evaluated the use of unseeded SIS scaffolds in five pediatric patients who did not desire bladder augmentation with bowel segments after repair of exstrophy-epispadias complex. Histologically, there was migration of all three tissue types into the scaffold, including nerve growth. The grafted portions of bladders had a greater proportion of collagen to muscle compared to native bladders. There was no significant change in bladder leak point pressures after placement of the graft, but three of the five patients had improvements in their bladder capacity at the six-month postoperative timepoint. There was a general increase in the length of time between incontinent episodes and a progressive increase in bladder volumes in all patients two to three years after surgery. However, no patient achieved full urinary continence.20\n\nA study in 2006 by Atala and colleagues used autologous seeding of scaffolds for cystoplasty in seven pediatric patients with a history of myelomeningocele who had high-pressure, low compliance bladders. Patients underwent cystoscopic evaluation with bladder biopsy to retrieve samples for in vitro cellular expansion. Cells were seeded on either collagen or collagen-PGA mesh scaffolds and anastomosed with or without omental wrap. There were no postoperative complications and patients were followed for a mean of 46 months. During the first 3-12 months postoperatively, bladder leak point pressures decreased in all patients while capacity and compliance exhibited variable responses in comparison to preoperative urodynamic findings. For the subset of patients who received augmentation with collagen-PGA scaffolds with omental wrap, there was a 1.58-fold increase in postoperative bladder capacity, which was not seen in the collagen scaffolds with or without omental wrap. Functionally, all patients benefitted from an increase in the average daytime dry interval. On histologic examination of the bladder grafts, the border between native and implanted bladders were indistinguishable and all three tissue layers were evident by 31-months after surgery. Notably, there was no evidence of re-innervation since all patients had to perform clean intermittent catheterization.17\n\nDespite these promising results, a subsequent prospective phase II study using a similar tissue engineering protocol, including omental wrap, was unable to replicate these outcomes. The authors assessed the use of autologous cell-seeded scaffolds for augmentation cystoplasty in children with NGB secondary to spina bifida at four tertiary children’s hospitals. Four out of 10 patients experienced decreased bladder capacity at one year after surgery without return to preoperative baseline even after 36 months. There was no convincing or consistent increase in bladder capacity or compliance 36 months after surgery and urodynamic changes were neither statistically nor clinically significant. Notably, four of the 10 patients had significant postoperative adverse events (i.e., bowel obstruction and/or bladder rupture). Ultimately, five of the 10 patients underwent traditional augmentation enterocystoplasty. The authors concluded that their intervention did not yield statistical nor clinical improvement overall and was associated with high rates of adverse events.21 The divergent outcomes in these two studies is likely multifactorial. The patients in Atala’s cohort were a very select subset of patients, which limits the applicability of this technique.22 Others have posited that absence of presurgical normal bladder cycling may predispose patients to implant failure, thereby excluding a large proportion of patients with bladder pathology for whom this therapy is intended for.23\n\nResults from animal studies demonstrated potential efficacy in bladder engineering, with regrowth of epithelium, smooth muscle, vasculature, and nervous tissue. However, regenerated tissue did not histologically resemble native bladders due to excessive fibrosis. The early progress in animals has not yet translated to overwhelming success in limited patient trials. Evidence of satisfactory bladder histology was equivocal and clinical outcomes were not better than traditional augmentation cystoplasty.24,25\n\nAnimal and Human Studies in Urethral Tissue Engineering\n\nGiven that the primary function of the urethra is to serve as a conduit for passage of urine from the bladder to the external environment, the benchmark of success in urethral tissue engineering has been measured mainly based on integrity and patency of grafts rather than histologic regrowth of tissue types, as is the case for bladder engineering.3 Various techniques for urethral reconstruction exist in pediatric urology, including primary anastomosis and skin and mucosal grafts.5,26 Tissue engineering is being explored as an alternative to these methods, particularly for repair of longer defects.\n\nDorin et al investigated the maximal length of native urethral tissue regeneration that could be achieved with urethral onlay of unseeded tubular bladder submucosa grafts in rabbits. They found normal urothelial growth and luminal patency in the 0.5 cm graft at one, two, and four-weeks postoperatively. The 1, 2, and 3 cm grafts all developed strictures by four weeks after surgery. Only the 0.5 cm length grafts had adequate ingrowth of epithelium and smooth muscle; all other lengths experienced fibrosis. It was concluded that unseeded tubular grafts could repair a maximal urethral defect length of 0.5 cm.27\n\nA later study by Orabi and colleagues compared efficacy of cell-seeded versus unseeded matrices in the repair of 6 cm urethral defects in dogs. Cells used for seeding were obtained through bladder biopsy for autologous cell expansion. Cell-seeded matrices remained patent 12 months after surgery while unseeded matrices developed strictures by three months. The seeded matrices had full layers of urothelium and smooth muscle, which the unseeded matrices lacked. It was hypothesized that the success of seeded matrices was due in part to an initial layer of protective urothelial cells which limited urine extravasation into the subepithelial space and causing subsequent fibrosis.28\n\nIn an early human trial of urethral tissue engineering, Fossum et al investigated the use of autologous cell-seeded collagen scaffolds for the treatment of severe hypospadias in six boys ages 14-44 months with 3-5.5 years of follow up. Five out of six patients had appropriate uroflow curves after surgery. Four patients developed complications, which consisted of two strictures and two fistulas, which were all corrected in an uneventful manner. Subsequent cystoscopy demonstrated patent neourethras in all patients. There was urothelium lining the neourethras of three patients, while two patients had epithelium-lined neourethras. At last follow-up, all patients voided without straining and had low post-void residuals.29 The investigators continued follow-up with these six boys until prepubertal ages and reported cosmetically appropriate outcomes. All patients continued to void with an adequate stream without straining. Five boys had bell-shaped urine flow curves with maximal flow rates ranging from 8.5-28.3 mL/s. One patient had a flat, extended urine flow curve but voided without issue. Cystoscopy demonstrated patent neourethras in all patients and artificial erections were without curvature. Given the complication rates associated with severe hypospadias, the authors were optimistic about their results as a possible alternative treatment modality. Follow-up of these patients is scheduled to continue during puberty and after full genital maturation.30\n\nIn a subsequent study, autologous cell-seeded PGA scaffolds were used in complex posterior urethral reconstruction in five boys with a median follow-up of 71 months. Grafts varied in length from 4 to 6 cm and normal histological tissue architecture was observed by three months after surgery. All neourethras remained patent 12 months after surgery and at the last follow-up. The mean end maximum flow rate was 25.1 mL/s as assessed by uroflow and there were no reported adverse events (e.g., infection, diverticula, dysuria, straining). The authors concluded that engineered neourethras can be successfully used in urethral repairs and that their results in posterior urethral reconstruction further bolster the success as the posterior urethra in boys is more delicate due to the lack of a mature prostate, necessitating more complex repairs than adult males.31\n\nBarriers and Future Directions\n\nLimited human studies have shown mixed results within the field of tissue engineering in pediatric urology with implications for future improvement. Currently, there lacks consistent, reproducible results in both bladder and urethral regeneration that yield compelling clinical and functional improvement without significant risks or complications. In order for tissue engineering to become a feasible treatment option for patients in the future, several barriers must be addressed to ensure optimal tissue growth and function. There needs to be a reliable source of cells that can be expanded in vitro for seeding of scaffolds; grafted tissue must be able to survive the requisite urinary environment of the genitourinary tract; and ideally dependable methods for nerve growth should be identified, particularly for bladder mucosal regeneration, to ensure the best chance for functional outcomes in children.\n\nAnimal and human trials using cell-seeded grafts tended to produce more durable results.17,27,31 Thus, it would not be unreasonable to presume that cell seeding may continue to play a role in future tissue engineering endeavors. While autologous cells, obtained through bladder biopsy for instance, may be convenient since it minimizes the risk of graft incompatibility, cells obtained from bladders with disease had limited survivability in vitro compared to healthy bladder controls. Healthy urothelium is mitotically quiescent with low cell turnover as demonstrated by a low Ki-67 index and presence of UPK3a, a molecular marker of terminal urothelium differentiation. However, cells from bladders with pathology have been shown to exhibit high proliferation rates (high Ki-67 indices) and low expression of UPK3a. This pattern was present in biopsies from patients with neurogenic bladder, posterior urethral valves, bladder dysfunction, and epispadias, suggesting that various pathologies of the genitourinary tract are capable of negatively impacting the ability of cells to expand and survive for use in autologous seeding of matrices.10,11 These results, coupled with the breadth of conditions that warrant surgical repair and reconstruction in pediatric urology, may lead to suboptimal results from tissue engineering using autologous cells.\n\nAdditional sources for cellular seeding may therefore benefit a large proportion of children. CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells induce angiogenesis and are implicated in peripheral nerve growth, while mesenchymal stem cells are a potential source for bladder smooth muscle. Together, they have been used to recapitulate bladder tissue in vivo and may be potential options.13 Another emerging avenue being explored is the use of urine-derived stem cells due to the lower cost and noninvasive nature of collection and their relatively high potential for differentiation.11,32 They have been induced into ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal cell lineages and hold potential for use in the field of urology, although the full spectrum of their biological characteristics still warrants further investigation.32\n\nRegardless of the source of cells that are used for seeding of matrices, they must be able to withstand the cytotoxic environment of urine. Previous studies have demonstrated that the simple addition of urine to growth medium led to decreased cell proliferation and survivability in various stem cells and even cultured urothelial cells.11,12,33 Additionally, tissues must also withstand radial stress and fluid shear forces associated with storage and emptying of urine, respectively. While cellular growth and seeding onto scaffolds in ideal growth conditions in vitro may establish a sufficient barrier to tolerate stressors of the urinary tract and alleviate the aforementioned issues, this adds additional time to the overall process, which currently already takes four to seven weeks.31 An option that has been proposed is the use of urinary diversion during the early postoperative period to allow implanted tissues adequate time to establish cell-cell connections while minimizing contact with urine.11 However, this predisposes patients to additional procedures that may increase the risk for infections.34 Adamowicz and colleagues proposed seeding cells on the external surface of the scaffold to reduce their contact with urine during the initial postoperative healing phase.12 Regardless of which method is ultimately pursued, Qin et al cautioned against postoperative transurethral catheterization as it was shown to mechanically disrupt grafted matrices, particularly in cases of urethral regeneration.35 Thus, another consideration for future work is reconciling the tradeoff of catheterization to decrease graft contact with urine with the sloughing of seeded cells from scaffolds.\n\nLastly, one of the goals of tissue engineering is to re-establish native function of the organ; in the case of the bladder, this is reliant on appropriate nerve growth and activity. To date, there have been mixed results in the realm of nerve growth.17,18,19,20 Despite evidence of nerve regeneration even with the use of unseeded scaffolds, there is no current evidence to demonstrate that these neurons have the capacity to function in a similar manner as native nervous tissue. The spinal pathways that mediate micturition involve bladder afferents, spinal cord efferents, spinal interneurons, and cortical projections that modulate these reflex circuits, components which are unlikely to be completely captured with bladder grafts alone.36 Furthermore, functional outcomes point toward deficits in nerve function since patients still experienced urinary incontinence and relied on clean intermittent catheterization.17,20,21 Work outside of pediatric urology in nerve tissue engineering has identified important characteristics of scaffolds that promote peripheral nerve growth: conductivity to enhance neuronal communication via action potentials, hydrophobicity to improve cell attachment, and larger pore size to stimulate cell proliferation and migration.37 As the field continues to advance, a delicate balance of scaffold porosity must be attained to foster nerve growth without causing extravasation of urine into the subepithelial space. Collaborating with experts in nerve engineering and drawing on the advancements in their field may lead to significant clinical outcomes for pediatric patients with bladder dysfunction.\n\nConclusion\n\nSignificant breakthroughs in pediatric urology tissue engineering have been made in the last few decades. Advances in biomaterials and cellular engineering have led to early success in tissue regeneration in animal models of urologic diseases. However, limited early human trials of similar interventions have not yielded conclusive, reproducible improvements in patients’ clinical function while minimizing risks. While tissue engineering has the potential to drastically alter the field of pediatric urology through tailored therapeutics, numerous pre-translational barriers still need to be addressed in order to optimize graft function in vivo. Additional long-term animal and human studies are necessary to better understand outcomes and complications, and multidisciplinary collaboration at all stages will undoubtedly be a key to future success.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Tissue engineering for urology patients is still under investigation with only preliminary early, translational studies having been completed.\n  Current challenges include revascularization of small vessel networks and incomplete neuralation within a host.\n  Should the field advance, however, it may dramatically improve outcomes from a number of congenital urological conditions.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBerthiaume F, Maguire TJ, Yarmush ML.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nCommentary and Edited By Liza M. Aguiar &amp; Anthony A. Caldamone\n\nIn 1991, Norman Zinner and co-authors published a paper entitled “Forecast of change in urology.”1 In this article they reviewed the results of a survey conducted by the Society of University Urologists asking members to identify the most important events or trends that would be likely to occur in the next 10-30 years in urology. This was published as the “1976 Possibilities List.” Table 1 lists a few of these that you would find interesting. This list covers areas of medical advancement, technological advancements, socio-economic factors, and education and training. Based on an analysis by a panel of experts, it was felt that urologists were remarkably accurate in their forecast of the most important trends and events over the issuing years. Areas where the 1976 urologist survey results did not envision important changes were in diagnostic imaging, HMO/PPOs, and outpatient surgeries.\n\nTable 1 Selected listing of the Society of University Urologists study of the future: 1976 Possibilities List.1\n\n\n  \n    \n       \n      Prediction\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1\n      Functional synthetic ureter, bladder, and urethra developed\n    \n    \n      2\n      Implantable small kidneys developed\n    \n    \n      3\n      External urinary diversion seldom performed\n    \n    \n      4\n      Development of foolproof form of antibacterial prophylaxis\n    \n    \n      5\n      Development of miniaturized and improved endoscopic instrumentation\n    \n    \n      6\n      Mandatory use of computers in diagnosis and treatment\n    \n    \n      7\n      Development of communications which permit remote two-way patient-physician interaction\n    \n    \n      8\n      National and international “on-line” grand rounds, including instant display of x-rays, etc.\n    \n    \n      9\n      Fertility problems controlled medically\n    \n    \n      10\n      Anomalies eliminated by genetic manipulation\n    \n    \n      11\n      Development of practical intrauterine diagnosis and therapy\n    \n    \n      12\n      Development of regionalized health care system with super specialization of major centers\n    \n    \n      13\n      Cost of medical education increases substantially\n    \n    \n      14\n      Natural disasters occur\n    \n    \n      15\n      Extrauterine fetal development and monitoring become feasible\n    \n    \n      16\n      Public hostility toward physicians increases\n    \n    \n      17\n      Type and number of residency programs subjected to government control\n    \n    \n      18\n      Urology residencies limited to university centers\n    \n    \n      19\n      Development of residency matching program\n    \n    \n      20\n      Team approach to patient care widely adopted\n    \n  \n\n\nIn this chapter, we take on the challenge of predicting what changes will occur in pediatric urology over the next 25 or more years. We have broken down the chapter into several content specific areas. We asked recognized experts in each of those content areas to predict the changes in their estimation that we will likely see over the next quarter decade. The chapter editors have provided a short commentary for each area as well.\n\nPrenatal Diagnosis and Treatment in 2050\n\nBy Marie-Klaire Farrugia\n\nAntenatal ultrasound and fetal MRI will be obsolete. Fetal anatomy will be visualised by 3D augmented reality, using smart phones. The fetal anatomy can then be analysed digitally and fetal measurements automatically plotted onto growth charts. Artificial intelligence (AI) will capture data instantaneously and provide a medical report. When a group of anomalies is identified, AI will suggest genetic, syndromic or other diagnoses and provide information on prognosis and further management. For example, if fetal lower urinary tract obstruction is diagnosed, the application can then formulate a “virtual cystoscopy,” augmented reality model to further delineate the cause of obstruction. Fetal renal cortical analysis (utilising data from echogenicity, cortical thickness or cysts, with the potential addition of fetal urine peptide signature) will estimate fetal renal function. Amniotic fluid level and its components will be measured utilising density and reflectivity data, without the need for invasive testing. Based on AI algorithms, the application will determine whether fetal intervention is indicated, and when. Once intervention is recommended, a special headset is worn by the specialist, whereby computer-generated laser holograms superimpose the safest pathway for the fetal cystoscope to be introduced, on the maternal abdomen. A flexible fetal cystoscope can then be inserted in an antegrade fashion via the fetal abdomen, into the bladder, and the urethra stented with a made-to-measure pre-formed coiled stent which can be “shot” into the urethra. The biggest challenge will be consent, in an era where surgery on the fetus without its consent is controversial.\n\nComment\n\nPregnancy and the developing fetus was once a “black box” of medicine. Now, with better understanding of fetal development, and technological advancements in prenatal imaging and prenatal interventions, the fetus has become as much of a patient as its host. Fetal medicine will continue to grow as a field the more we learn and are able to do during the earliest stages of development. We currently have multiple pediatric subspecialities, but who knows if in the future, we will have fetal subspecialties, including fetal urologists.\n\nThe “Top-Down” Approach to the Evaluation of Children with Febrile Urinary Tract Infection in 2050\n\nBy Hans G. Pohl\n\nThe year 2050 will be celebrated for the consolidation of the US pediatric urology programs into the North American Pediatric Genitourinary Outcomes Alliance and the publication of its first project “High-yield evaluation and treatment algorithm for pediatric urinary tract infection and associated CAKUT.” First proposed in 2025 at a meeting of the Society for Pediatric Urology to address the nagging question of whether the “bottom-up” or “top-down” approach to UTI evaluation is the superior algorithm, the members agreed to collaborate on a nation-wide multi-institutional study of children younger than 2 years old who presented with initial febrile UTIs. It was agreed that the inclusion of older, toilet-trained children introduced too much complexity and, so, the role of elimination disorders in determining the risk for UTI and how best to manage bladder-bowel dysfunction would be the focus of future collaborations, if this foray succeeded.\n\nFive years elapsed to achieve agreement on nomenclature and imaging methodology, including the collection of blood and urine samples at the time of presentation. The consortium members sought to utilize evolving technologies in high-throughput proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome analysis to create a personalized map of biological interactions using network visualization and analysis of high-dimensional data. Big data and artificial intelligence would settle the debate.\n\nMost programs opted to recruit for the “bottom-up” approach, with few providing patients undergoing upper tract imaging first, each according to the local bias. Standard contrast-radiography VCUGs or voiding urosonograms were used to seek VUR. Even among those employing the “top-down” approach, DMSA and MRU were selectively used based on institutional preference. Notwithstanding the lack of a standard approach across all institutions, perseverance yielded a trove of data in a central repository. The consortium had underestimated its success, driven partly by investigator zeal to answer the question as well as a fair sense of competition to recruit one’s allotment of data. How does one perform component analysis considering, for instance, serum procalcitonin levels, urinary biomarkers, single-nucleotide polymorphisms encoding innate immunity, bacterial metabolomics, and imaging findings? Help arrived from social media companies.\n\nIn the 2020s, the public discourse focused on the role of social media and “big data” as a determinant of socioeconomic, political, and personal well-being. Reeling from a decade of class-action suits and trans-national governmental inquiries, six of the largest technology firms made earnest commitment toward the public trust. Not unlike the photo sharing app, Snapchat, the enormous computing power available to these companies would be leveraged to answer specific questions within a finite period, then all data would be deleted, and all findings made publicly available and programmed as best-practice guidelines into the electronic health record systems.\n\nThe consortium confirmed the poor reliability of renal sonography to detect upper urinary tract abnormalities and the improved sensitivity of DMSA and MRU in identifying renal involvement.2,3,4 However, there was limited utility in employing a top-down approach the longer the interval between the symptomatic UTI and presentation for evaluation. The “bottom-up” approach had greater sensitivity for the detection of all cases of VUR. Superficially the age-old controversies pitting one form of invasive testing versus another were unresolved, until the inclusion of biomarker data of host-pathogen interaction. Using this multi-variable approach, the consortium proved the superiority of the “top-down” approach where serum and urine biomarkers served as a proxy for DMSA scans.5 A biochemical risk profile could then be created to inform further evaluation by voiding urosonography rather than by VCUG. As clinical data were entered into a risk calculator, the likelihood of the patient’s microbiome developing resistance, the likelihood of breakthrough symptomatic UTI and the likelihood of reflux resolution were generated. Not unlike the Partin tables for the prediction of prostate cancer disease progression, the VUR nomograms informed treatment selection; antimicrobial prophylaxis versus surgical correction. At the time of publication, the consortium foresaw that, in addition to foregoing ionizing radiation in the algorithm, catheterization would no longer be required as a new, ultra-fast MRI protocol resulted in rendering intra-vesical urine bright, thus creating the means for cystography without radiation or catheterization. The group celebrated their accomplishment the following year at the Wee Willies July 2051, Anchorage, Alaska, overlooking the leading edge of Portage Glacier as it once again filled the lake of the same name.\n\nComment\n\nOur understanding of urinary tract infections and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children has dramatically evolved over the past 50 years – from believing that VUR was rare and caused by bladder outlet obstruction to better understanding its natural history, association with bowel and bladder dysfunction, etc. Both parents and pediatric urologists would welcome a world in which the work-up for a febrile urinary tract infection in a child would no longer include invasive testing. In addition, individualized and accurate risk assessment, potentially determined by a nomogram app, would greatly improve our management.\n\nA Look at Hypospadias Management of the Future\n\nBy Christopher J. Long, MD\n\nEnvisioning the future of hypospadiology must start with an honest assessment of our current success and failures. Recent reports have revealed a low but significant complication rate for distal hypospadias and a much higher risk in proximal repairs, trends that are likely to continue to increase as follow-up extends through puberty. Our current management of hypospadias includes a lack of consistent follow up from childhood repair through adulthood, inconsistent incorporation of patient reported outcomes (PRO), and barriers to multi-institutional collaboration efforts to improve surgical outcomes.\n\nWe are only beginning to scratch the surface of utilizing machine learning as a tool in hypospadias management. Assessment of chordee and standardizing measurements such as penile length and glans width have been done but have not gained widespread acceptance. My hope is that one day we look back on this as the first step in our use of this resource. As we increase collaborative efforts with accumulating surgical data and photographs, they could be used to generate an app or website in which the surgeon can take a picture of a child’s specific anatomy and generate a picture of the anticipated outcome to facilitate the decision process. Perhaps the app could also generate an anatomic-specific recommendation for surgical intervention—such as a 1 versus 2 stage repair or the use of a dorsal inlay graft versus Thiersch-Duplay versus Mathieu repair. It would run the patient’s specific anatomy through an algorithm predicting outcomes. Perhaps this will also identify those at particularly high risk for poor outcomes—those with a small, flat glans, those with more dysplastic penile tissue, or even an abnormal anogenital distance, or other factors which we are yet to appreciate. Maybe tissue engineering advances to the point where we can request a synthetic replacement for scant spongiosum, which represents a vital deficiency in these patients. Ultimately, as we continue to expand the role of coaching and surgical “game tape,” having a computer model that could identify the optimal approach and display the key steps in video format will further improve surgical outcomes.\n\nThe future of hypospadias surgery should be patient centered. As much as we have refined our techniques and become more self-aware of outcomes, the patient voice is one that will answer current controversies such as the ideal age of repair, the true clinically significant degree of penile curvature, what we should classify as a successful repair, and if we should even repair a particular variant. Utilization of patient reported outcome (PRO) measures must increase, and the patient voice should be a major driver of our medical decision-making process.\n\nFinally, a framework is being established for a universal database utilizing the electronic medical record across a multi-institutional network. This collaboration will eliminate the limitations of underpowered studies to assess the many nuances of surgical management that currently plague the literature. In the future, this will lead to either universally improved outcomes across surgeons due to collaborative efforts and reduction in technical variation or the emergence of high-volume centers that should perform most highly complex procedures, particularly for less common severe variants.\n\nWe can never accurately predict the future, but my hope is that we can harness technologic advances to provide a level of care that we are not yet capable of providing.\n\nComment\n\nIt is true that the lack of objective assessment and standardization limits our ability to assess outcomes for hypospadias surgery, and perhaps technology or even artificial intelligence, can one day facilitate that. But, it may not be until we are able to tissue engineer a urethra or corpora spongiosal tissue, that we can actually significantly improve our surgical outcomes.\n\nThe Future of Stone Disease in Children\n\nBy Michael P. Kurtz, MD, MPH\n\nThere are exciting advances in the treatment of stones in children, with implications for the future. First caution, then hope.\n\nLithotripsy is complex, and while dangerous to bet against urologic ingenuity, we should acknowledge that there are some hard, durile, limits.6 PCNL is a good example. Percutaneous stone treatment has been performed using tracts so small that we normally associate them with needle gauge rather than French size. We also have ever-more powerful lithotripters, both ultrasonic/mechanical and with collimated coherent light around 2000 nM wavelength. The trouble is that transfer of energy from the lithotripter to stone is necessarily imperfect, remaining energy is mostly heat, and it is likely that smaller kidneys are the most vulnerable to heat.7 Compound this with poor-to-absent irrigant flow around the lithotripter itself, and you can see that while the stone may break, it may be at the cost of parenchymal damage. All of this suggests that while optics, lighting, lithotripters, and sheath size may miniaturize, the density of non-stone-breaking energy delivered may be dangerous. If we adopt new adult-based technology with potential thermal side effects, we, pediatric endourologists, will be the canary in the coal mine.\n\nSwitching to hot science, a rule-shattering finding has the potential to upend lithotripsy. Calcium stone formation has traditionally been modelled unidirectionally, unrelenting, with periods of stasis and growth. Once a clinic I will encounter a patient’s family wondering hopefully about a chemical stone dissolution formulation and its predatory, FDA-flouting claims. It turns out, someday, those might work. Stones are constantly in the process of formation and dissolution with over half of all stones undergoing such events.6,8 Agents that enhance dissolution at the margin may truly dissolve calcium stones. I suspect we will need to keep our supply closets stocked with lithotripsy equipment for some time, as this would be implemented as treatment or secondary prevention in patients already presenting with stones, but we all can dream of a day in which stones can be washed away through diet, or endoluminal application of a medication.\n\nComment\n\nThe rising prevalence of pediatric stone disease has led to significant patient morbidity, in addition to a costly burden on the health care system. With stone disease comes emergency room visits, prescriptions, imaging with potential exposure to radiation and invasive procedures. It would be remarkable to have a safe litholytic agent that could react with a stone to form a water-soluble compound. We are also looking forward to advancements in technology that would allow for better endoscopic visualization, safer lasering techniques, and of course, stents associated with less stent discomfort.\n\nBladder Exstrophy-Epispadias Complex: Beyond the Horizon\n\nBy Dana A. Weiss\n\nSteve Zderic always says, if you want a new idea, read an old book. The treatment of bladder exstrophy has come full circle from the 1960s when John K. Lattimer focused on a delayed complete repair, to the early staged repair championed by Bob Jeffs, John Gearhart and Julian Ansell, and back again to a delayed complete repair (CPRE) described by Michael Mitchell. With new techniques and the added safety net of clean intermittent catheterization, the complete repair is again a common approach in 2021, now refined, under the coaching of Mike Mitchell himself, by the MIBEC consortium at CHOP, Boston Children’s, and the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin. The question is where will this ever-changing circle be in 2050? My prediction is that current techniques will continue to improve, and a major adjuvant will be the addition of a “tincture of time” to our initial repairs, be they complete or staged, to achieve the ultimate goal of volitional voiding with continence.\n\nWe have shown with urodynamics that the bladder detrusor can function and contract, which allows for volitional voiding. We also know that the exstrophic bladder grows – at all times, from the newborn period when closure is sometimes delayed to allow for bladder plate growth, to the post-closure period, in the modern staged and complete repairs, when continence procedures are performed on only those who have achieved bladder growth to 100 mL. We also have witnessed that the bladder neck can be reconstructed in a way that recapitulates a normal bladder neck, with the ability to coapt and funnel with voiding. If you combine these advances and current observations, with the fact that we know that 20% of children who underwent closure in the past, before much of the modern nuances were known, can void with continence after a single surgery, then it seems that far before 2050 we will be seeing the majority of children born with BE grow into adults with the capability to volitionally void and be continent.\n\nInnovations of surgical technique, detailed 3D imaging, and intraoperative assessments have already advanced our understanding of how we can recapitulate normal functioning anatomy during the initial closure of exstrophy. These combined with adjunctive therapies such as physical therapy to augment the function of pelvic floor muscles, and the addition of time for growth and strength to develop, demonstrate that the future for those with bladder exstrophy is bright.\n\nAllowing time itself to promote continence, will require a new mentality—one that will understand that people, let alone children, do not follow set prescribed timelines. Our new appreciation of individuality will aid in this shift. Gone will be the precept that all 5-year-olds must be out of diapers. If it takes one until the age of 20 to safely become fully dry, and then to live the next 60–80 years with the ability to void and to maintain healthy kidneys, then isn’t that a far better option than to force dryness at the age of 5, and for the bladder to peter out by age 20, followed by 75 years of catheterizations, irrigations, bladder stones, and stomal complications.\n\nBy well before 2050 we will know what the optimal course of action is, not just from questioning the few, the believers, but from learning from the patients themselves, as a group—to understand what matters to those actually living with the bladder exstrophy. That is where the goal post really lays.\n\nIf science continues to advance as fast as it has for the last 30 years, we will see even greater advances. Perhaps fetal surgery will become so safe that we can close the bladder in utero, to allow for the additional 3–4 months of bladder cycling before birth, thus shifting the timeline for bladder growth. Or, while our current dream is to repair BE to make a functioning bladder, perhaps by 2050 our understanding of the genetics of exstrophy will be robust and we will have a better understanding of what leads to exstrophy, and with the potential of gene editing, we could prevent bladder exstrophy altogether... As Yogi Berra said, “It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.”\n\nComment\n\nThe bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex is one of the most complex anomalies in pediatric urology, involving anatomic, functional, cosmetic, sexual, reproductive and psychosocial factors. Regionalization of care for rare congenital disorders has long been advocated by physicians and health care leaders, as it has been proven to improve survival and reduce disability. However, it is important to also have a supportive and well-organized healthcare system that allows for access to these centers of excellence in order to prevent disparities between different patient populations.\n\nDSD in Pediatric Urology: What to Expect by 2050\n\nBy Anne-Françoise Spinoit\n\nDifferences of Sex Development (DSD) is a field where the medical practice has completely changed over the last thirty years, and I believe even more evolution is to be expected in the next decades.\n\nTaking the name related to the condition under the scope, it reflects quite accurately the evolution: Children born with ambiguous genitals used to be referred ‘secretly’ to a surgeon to quickly fix an ‘hermaphrodite’ condition with a surgical intervention meant to allow ‘classification’ of the child into the dichotomy boy or girl. The decision to operate was often taken by the surgeon alone. Along with evolution of patient care towards multidisciplinary decision-making, the ‘intersex’ term for the condition became more popular. Pediatricians, adult and pediatric specialists in endocrinology, gynecology, psychology, genetics widened the perspective from which the condition is examined and created new insights.\n\nTrue revolution came with the Chicago consensus statement in 2006;9 patient and family involvement, open communication, and avoidance of ‘shameful historical terms’ highlighted a trend which is nowadays peaking. The term Disorders of Sex Development was born. It was probably the stepping stone for acceptance and popularization of what used to be considered as abnormalities and rename it as variation. As patient involvement grew, patients felt the term ‘disorder’ stigmatizing and asked for acceptance of their physical conditions. Where the aim of all medical treatments used to be ‘normalization’ of the differences, acceptance of the differences, sometimes without surgical correction, was the new request. In 2018, the term Disorder of Sex Development was changed to Differences of Sex Development.10\n\nThis evolution from a purely surgical to a multidisciplinary care with patient involvement provides better results with less psychological distress.11 However, some patients went even further, founding activists groups fighting against irreversible medical care. It has led to reports and regulations like those from the Human Rights Watch “I want to be like nature made me”, stating surgery is unnecessary, and could be considered as torture in children. Scientific societies strongly reacted against those statements,12 without significant reaction from non-medical groups.\n\nThose reports might give us a glance of what the coming years of DSD patients care might look like.13 Today, watchful waiting and avoiding irreversible surgery has become standard of care, partly under pressure of activists groups. In many countries and centers in Europe, North America and UK, some feminizing surgeries are rarely performed. As we have no long-term follow-up of non-operated DSD patients, their outcome remains unclear.\n\nSurgical experience will have to shift from pediatric professionals to adolescent professionals.\n\nWhere the future will take us is unclear. The task of the professionals is to provide excellent follow-up for all patients, and, above all, to listen to the patients who are raised without surgery and, if we see concerning developments there, to report them, and, if necessary, to adjust our approach.\n\nThis approach may prevent us from having a group of non-operated activists asking us to adjust our approach in a few decades' time. In this way, we avoid the pendulum swinging too far between the extremes of early and late surgery.\n\nComment\n\nCaring for patients with DSD continues to be a struggle in the setting of societies that do not totally embrace a more non-binary, fluid view of sexual identity. We hope that in 2050, this will be different. There is widespread concern in the medical community regarding legislation regulating medical care. Most believe that changes in medicine should be based on scientific research and medical guidelines, as these changes are evidence-based and can happen within months and even weeks. It would be impossible to apply legislation in this fast-paced setting. In addition, we know there is nothing absolute in medicine; there is no 100%; There is always an exception to every rule. The viewpoint that every child should be celebrated as an individual is one that we agree is fundamental, yet the very nature of legislation often fails to take into account the specific needs of each patient.\n\nUrologic Management of Spina Bifida in 2050\n\nBy Marcela Leal da Cruz\n\nOpen spina bifida is a major cause of neurogenic bladder in childhood. A new paradigm was established in this scenario after the MOMS study14 that substantiated the use of fetal surgery as a standard method in trained services. Despite enthusiastic results of the neurological and orthopedic aspects, bladder function did not follow the same path. The prospective series in the post-MOMS era include the American groups involved in MOMS15 and the Zurich group16 which suggest some urologic benefits. The data from our group in São Paulo/Brazil17,18,19 did not show improvements in bladder function after MMC fetal repair.\n\nThe development of new approaches in fetal surgery, such as fetoscopy, promises to improve obstetric outcomes. Regarding urological outcomes, Gerber et al evaluated the prevalence of high-risk bladder dynamics among different types of myelomeningocele (MMC) repairs. They observed a decrease in high-risk bladder dynamics between the first and the follow-up (18 months) urodynamic evaluation in fetal surgery groups (35% to 8% in fetoscopic repair, 60% to 35% in open fetal repair), but no change in the postnatal repair group, which remained at 36%. These changes, however, were not statistically significant. In addition, the authors commented that long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate continence outcomes.20\n\nNew techniques are being researched to improve the results of fetal surgery. A promising alternative is stem cell therapies. Several investigators demonstrated the therapeutic potential of the intra-amniotic injection of mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the bone marrow, amniotic fluid and embryonic stem cells using experimental models of MMC.21\n\nThe advancement in fetal medicine and stem cell therapies bring enthusiasm for new possibilities to obtain good results. In addition, advances in genetic research involving the etiology of MMC may lead to gene therapies that would prevent neural tube defects in the future.\n\nRegarding urological management of MMC, we now have the urodynamic study as a fundamental tool. Maybe, in 2050, urodynamics will allow us to have a continuous bladder pressure recording for a whole day or a few days (similar to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring), which may improve our understanding of individual bladder patterns.\n\nManagement of neurogenic bladder principles consists of adequately treating the high-risk bladder to preserve renal function and achieving continence. The treatments consist in use of medication, clean intermittent catheterization and a complex arsenal of reconstructive surgical techniques. Looking to the future, I consider two challenges. The first is to improve results, especially related to continence, through improvements in surgical techniques. The second is, following the trend of advances in medicine, developing technology that restores organic function without the need of external devices or body modifications.\n\nAn evolution in nanotechnology may solve these challenges. Nanomedicine can be applied to improve the specificity of a drug’s action, in addition to regenerating and restoring organic functions. Will future generations be able to regenerate the neural tissue affected in MMC or even reprogram the functionality of a neurogenic bladder?\n\nComment\n\nSo much of what we do every day, as pediatric urologists, centers around restoring function to existing anatomy. The neuropathic bladder is one of our biggest challenges. Although there have been significant advancements in the care of spina bifida patients, including fetal intervention, it is exciting to think that pluripotent stem cells could one day develop into a functioning bladder, potentially obviating the need for major reconstructive surgery.\n\nBasic Science Research in Pediatric Urology in 2050\n\nBy Luke Harper\n\nBasic science research shapes clinical practice and vice versa. These two fields are intertwined and imagining the future of one requires imagining the future of the other.\n\nBasic science has revealed, more and more, the biological uniqueness of each individual, and hence we move closer and closer to the concept of personalized medicine. Whole-genome sequencing, and the astronomic quantity of data it will bring, will progressively pave the way for more precise patient characterization. Genetic and epigenetic identification will explain not only the existence of medical conditions but also how these conditions will likely evolve or respond to treatments. This will gradually allow for more tailored strategies. By combining the information garnered through the study of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, the complex and highly individual interactions of the human body will progressively unveil themselves.\n\nClinical research will incorporate experimental models that integrate the uniqueness of the individual, such as “N-of-1” or “adaptive and sequential” clinical trials.22,23 Computer-modeling will allow for extrapolation of individual traits to virtual populations, allowing researchers to interpret results unburdened by variations caused by the biological heterogeneity of a classic study population. These models, along with technological advances such as organs-on-a-chip—i.e., microfluidic cell culture devices that simulate physiological organ responses in vitro—will help do away completely with the need for animal and human testing.24 At a cellular level, patient-derived cellular avatars, i.e., cells harvested then cultivated from an individual, will allow for pre-treatment in vitro testing and individualized treatment customization.25\n\nResearch in stem cell tissue engineering will increasingly allow for replacement of failing organs using the patients’ own cells thus avoiding the risks of rejection, or the need for immunosuppressive agents.26\n\nBut illness will always be most often the result of the interaction between an individual and his environment and, in this way, basic science will always have to adjust to the changes affecting the world we live in. One of the greatest challenges of the next 30 years will be adapting to our environment. This not only includes the effects of climate change, but also all that we will be exposed to, including pollutants, toxins, germs, viruses, etc…. Our changing environment might deeply impact our biochemical properties, and early detection of some of these biochemical changes will be detectable just by the clothes we wear.27\n\nOf course, as the great scientist Niels Bohr purportedly said, “Prediction is difficult, especially when dealing with the future,” and there is a good chance that future basic research will focus on areas we do not even know exist yet. And, technology has accelerated so much in the past decades that what we have just described might just be the research of 2025. And in reality, by the time we reach 2050, the questions basic science will be concentrating on might well concern the conditions of life on Mars.28\n\nComment\n\nWe live in a world in which randomized control trials are considered the sine qua non of medical research, as they reveal the most generalizable results. It is remarkable to think that the future of medical research may include more N-of-1 or single subject clinical trials, where an individual patient is the sole unit of observation in a study. This would be the ultimate in individualized medical care.\n\nAI for Pediatric Urology in 2050\n\nBy Armando J. Lorenzo &amp; Mandy Rickard\n\nRecent years have seen a dramatic interest in the use of cutting-edge analytical tools to evaluate information. Around us, data is captured in exponential amounts, demanding strategies that accurately and efficiently evaluate it. Among the most promising recent advances, is the use of artificial intelligence (AI). This field of computer science aims to develop systems that can perform tasks in a manner that mimics the process in the human brain. The generated algorithms can therefore improve with further refinement and additional data, akin to what we describe as “gaining experience.” Within this umbrella term, Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI that develops programs and algorithms with the goal of providing computers with the ability to learn an assignment automatically, with limited human intervention and without the need to explicitly program each step. Ultimately, these tools can currently tackle a large number of narrow, well-defined tasks, quickly and accurately, impacting everything around us.\n\nWhat does the future hold for AI in pediatric urology in the next few decades? Larger and more complicated datasets are going to become commonplace, making traditional statistical tools insufficient. In addition, the demand for precision/personalized medicine along with quick (point of care) analyses to guide clinical care will likely be the rule rather than the exception. Thus, in our specialty (as in many others) the standard will be AI-driven algorithms integrated with commonly employed tools (electronic medical records, image storage platforms), based on a seamless amalgamation with common tools (such as electronic medical records, PACS®). Automated image, data capture and manipulation will aid clinicians in delivering evidence-based care. We should expect that our health care systems will need to adapt with more powerful interfaces, stronger databases, and robust computing power. Similarly, more training in computer science will be required in order to help integrate these tools with clinical care. Undoubtedly, delivery of care will change, and how we train future generations of pediatric urologists will have to adapt. Quicker data collection, on-the-spot analysis, and assisted decision making will demand that all providers learn a new way to integrate with these systems, and fully understand their capabilities and drawbacks.\n\nAs is the case with many other emergent technologies, caution is warranted. The quality of the data as well as the use of high-level and appropriate methodology ensures proper development of an initial algorithm.29 However, further steps are needed to ensure generalizability and minimize bias, common problems in many of the tools that are being generated for different classification and prediction products. Equally important is the issue of blind trust in these tools, which commonly have the so-called “black box effect” (i.e., opacity in how the ML algorithm works). The benefits in automation, speed, and ability to deal with complex data becomes meaningless if there is lack of regulation and human supervision.\n\nComment\n\nJohn McCarthy, an American computer and cognitive scientist, first described the term artificial intelligence (AI) in 1956 as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines. Now, Fitbit, Apple, and other health trackers can monitor an individual’s heart rate, activity levels, sleep levels, and EKG tracings. In the medical field, we have become accustomed to AI helping us peripherally—scheduling of appointments, online check-ins in medical centers, digitization of medical records, reminder calls for follow-up appointments. The question is whether patients and physicians will ever truly trust AI to help diagnose patients, recommend treatment, make predictions about patients' future health—even with our supervision.\n\nConclusion\n\nWayne Gretzky, a famous Canadian ice hockey player once said, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.” Although seemingly impossible, forecasting the future is often the very foundation of innovation, progress, and of success. The validity of the above predictions, of course, can only be determined by an assessment and comparison in 25 years. The challenge will be, therefore, that a future generation of pediatric urologists would assess the validity of the predictions and their impact on the practice of urology in 2050. Our hope is that in 2050, pediatric urologists will take the time to look back at not only our present practice, but our predictions of the future and learn from them in a way that promotes progress.\n\nReferences\n\n\nZinner NR, Enzer S, Brosman SA.

        "title": "Multicenter Collaboratives",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe quality of research in pediatric urology is historically low due to a predominance of small retrospective studies at single centers. The rarity and complexity of many conditions create a challenge for high-quality research. While the feasibility of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the pediatric surgical literature is debated, the need for more prospective study design and multicenter collaboration is clear. A prospective study design decreases the potential for bias, while a multicenter collaboration allows for a larger sample size to increase the statistical power and more generalizability. A multicenter collaboration is also benefitial to share the workload for research, provide more educational and funding opportunities, and build a relationship with the participating centers through a shared experience. Furthermore, it can shift the referral patterns and build a practice, as referring providers as well as patients and families understand which centers have an expertise and are able to achieve an excellent outcome for a particular condition. However, a multicenter collaboration is not without its challenges, such as a significant committment of time and resources as well as the need for leadership and coordination across mulitple centers to complete the necessary tasks in a timely fashion. The purpose of this chapter is to review the recent multicenter collaboratives in pediatric urology in the United States (US), including those registered with the Societies for Pediatric Urology and others that have made a significant contribution. While there are numerous multicenter collaboratives in pediatirc urology oncology, those are ouside the scope for this chapter.\n\nThe Society for Fetal Urology\n\nThe SFU hydronephrosis registry is a prospective registry that was developed in 2006. Its objective is to study the natural history of prenatal hydronephrosis and to guide the management of these patients. The participating centers include Children’s Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, Children’s Hospital of Orange County, Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, McMaster University, University of Iowa, University of Virginia, and University of Wisconsin.\n\nZee et al initially sought to assess the incidence and identify the risk factors for urinary tract infection (UTI) in a study of 213 patients with a prenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis between September 2008 and October 2015. A total of 18 (8%) patients developed a UTI during the study period, most of which occurred during their first year of life (89%). Only a female sex (OR 8.4, 95% CI 2.8–24.7) was an independent predictor of UTI on multivariate analysis. When stratified by sex, both the grade of hydronephrosis (OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.1–61.9) and circumcision status (OR 23.2, 95% CI 2.2–238.9) were an independent predictor of UTI in male patients on multivariate analysis.1\n\nIn a subsequent study of 248 patients over the same period, Zee et al assessed the resolution of prenatal hydronephrosis after birth. The time to resolution favored a lower grade of hydronephrosis with a median follow-up of 15 months (IQR 7–24). A majority of hydronephrosis resolved or improved within 3 years, and surgical intervention was only required in 14 (8%) patients.2\n\nHolzman et al also sought to determine the definition of clinically relevant hydroureter, its association with UTI, and the impact of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) in a study of 237 patients with ureteral measurements on ultrasound between 2008–2020. Among patients who did not have vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on voiding cystourethrogram, a ureteral diameter ≥7 mm was an independent predictor of UTI on multivariate analysis (HR 4.6, 95% CI 1.1–19.5). CAP was aslo significantly protective against UTI (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28–0.87).3\n\nChamberlin et al most recently assessed the incidence of UTI and impact of CAP in a study of 801 patients with a history of isolated prenatal hydronephrosis (no hydroureter) between 2008-2020. A total of 34 (4.2%) patients developed a UTI during the study period with a median follow-up of 1.6 years (IQR 0.85–2.7). A female sex (HR 13, 95% CI 3.8–44), circumcision status (HR 5.1, 95% CI 1.4–18), and SFU grade 3-4 hydronephrosis (HR 2.0, 95% CI 0.99–4.0) were each an independent predictor of UTI on multivariate analysis. The risk of UTI was not significantly different between those who received and did not receive CAP (4.0% vs. 4.3%) after adjusting for the sex, circumcision status, and grade of hydronephrosis on multivariate analysis (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34-1.5).4\n\nNational Spina Bifida Patient Registry\n\nDue to differences in the staffing, delivery of services, and care in spina bifida clinics across the US, the Professional Advisory Council of the Spina Bifida Association developed the NSBPR at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2008. By providing the framework for a systematic approach to improve the quality of care, the NSBPR collects comparative data on demographics, treatments, and outcomes for children, adolescents, and adults ≥21 years of age who attend the 21 participating spina bifida clinics in the US.\n\nTwo studies have assessed the variation in the surgical managements of patients in the NSBPR. Routh et al assesed the surgical management of neurogenic bowel in a study of 5,528 patients enrolled in the NSBPR between 2009-2015. A total of 1,088 (19.7%) patients underwent a surgery for neurogenic bowel, including a Malone anterograde continence enema or cecostomy tube in 957 (17.3%) patients and an ileostomy or colostomy in 155 (2.8%) patients. An older age (p&lt;0.001), female sex (p=0.02), white race (p=0.002), myelomeningocele (MMC) diagnosis (p=0.01), higher level of lesion (p&lt;0.001), mobility status (p=0.01), private insurance (p=0.002), and NSBPR clinic (p&lt;0.001) were each independently associated with an increased odds of surgery on multivariate analysis.5 Routh et al further assessed the surgical management of neurogenic bladder during the same study period. A total of 1,129 (20.4%) patients underwent a lower urinary tract reconstruction, including an augemntation cystoplasty in 703 (12.7%) patients, continent catheterizable channel in 382 (6.9%) patients, and bladder outlet procedure in 189 (3.4%) patients. The rates of lower urinary tract reconstruction widely varied from 12.1% to 37.9% among the NSBPR clinics. An older age, female sex, MMC diagnosis, mobility status, and NSBPR clinic (all p&lt;0.0001) were each independently associated with an increased odds of surgery on multivariate analysis.6 Both studies observed a wide variation in surgical management based on both clinical- and non-clinical factors.5,6\n\nSeveral studies have also assessed the bladder and bowel continence of patients in the NSBPR. In a study of 3,252 patients ≥5 years of age enrolled in the NSBPR between March 2009 and Septmeber 2012, Freeman et al reported that 1,326 (40.8%) patients were continent of urine with or without intervention during the day and that 1,398 (43.0%) patients had no involuntary leakage of stool with or without intervention during the day upon enrollment. The rates of bladder continence widely varied from 18.8% to 56.4% among the NSBPR clinics. An older age, female sex, race/ethnicity, private insurance, and NSBPR clinic were each independently associated with bladder continence for the entire cohort and those meeting the criteria for bladder impairment on multivariate analysis. The rates of bowel continence also widely varied from 17.2% to 65.0% among the NSBPR clinics. An older age, female sex, race/ethnicity, private insurance, and NSBPR clinic were each independently associated with bowel continence for the entire cohort and those meeting the criteria for bowel impairment on multivariate analysis. Both a sacral level of lesion when compared to a thoracic level (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.12–2.20) as well as a non-ambulator when compoared to a community ambulator (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58–0.99) were independently associated with bowel continence in the entire cohort. A non-MMC diagnosis was independently associated with bladder (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.36–2.10) and bowel (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.39–2.23) continence in the entire cohort as well.7 In a subsequent study of 5,250 patients ≥5 years of age enrolled in the NSBPR between 2009-2015, Lie et al assessed the bladder continence in a longitudinal fashion. By last follow-up, 1,178 (22.4%) patients underwent a lower urinary tract reconstruction, 4,833 (92.6%) patients used some form of bladder management, and 2,402 (45.8%) patients had no or less than 1 episode of daytime incontinence per month. An older age, female sex, race/ethnicity, non-MMC diagnosis, lower level of lesion, mobility status, and private insurance (all p&lt;0.001) were each independently associated with bladder continence on multivariate analysis. Both a history of lower urinary tract reconstruction (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.7–2.1) and any form of bladder management (OR 3.8, 95% CI 3.2–4.6) were also independently associated with bladder continence. The association between bladder management and continence was stronger for patients with a MMC diagnosis than those with a non-MMC diagnosis as well.8 Smith et al most recently focused on the ethnic disparities of bladder and bowel continence In a study of 4,364 patients between 5–21 years of age enrolled in the NSBPR between 2009–2015. By last follow-up, the Hispanic/Latino population had a significantly lower rate of private insurance (18.2% vs. 58.0%), lower urinary tract reconstruction (18.1% vs. 22.1%), surgery for neurogenic bowel (11.7% vs. 25.1%), bladder continence (38.6% vs. 44.9%), and bowel continence (43.9% vs. 55.8%) as well as a significantly higher rate of cutaneous vesicostomies (7.5% vs. 5.8%). A Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72–0.94) remained independently associated with a decreased odds of bowel continence on multivariate analysis.9\n\nTwo studies have specifically focused on adult patients in the NSBPR as well. Wiener et al assessed the bowel management and continence in a study of 5,209 patients ≥5 years of age enrolled in the NSBPR between September 2008 and December 2015. When compared to children between 5-11 years of age and adolescents between 12-19 yeas of age, the adult population was significantly less likely to use a Malone anterograde continence enema (17.1%) or cecostomy tube (5.5%) as well as more likely to use digital stimulation (4.4%) or disimpaction (3.0%) or have undergone a colostomy (3.9%). A total of 767 (58.3%) adults had no or less than 1 episode of bowel incontinence per month, including 630 (55.6%) adults with a MMC and 147 (74.9%) adults with a non-MMC diagnosis (p&lt;0.0001). Only a lack of full or part-time employment (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42-0.83) was independently associated with bowel continence on multivariate analysis.10 Wiener et al further assessed the bladder management and continence during the same study period. When compared to children between 5-11 years of age and adolescents between 12-19 yeas of age, the adult cohort was significantly more likely to use CAP (17.4%) and perform CIC (76.8%) as well as less likely to use an anticholinergic medication (47.7%) and void spontaneously (10.5%). The types of lower urinary tract reconstruction also widely varied among the cohorts, including a significantly higher rate of augmentation cystoplasty in adults (23.0%). A total of 661 (48.2%) adults had no or less than 1 episode of daytime incontinence per month, including 543 (45.8%) adults with a MMC and 118 (63.1%) adults with a non-MMC diagnosis (p&lt;0.0001). Bladder continence significantly improved with age in patients with a MMC (p&lt;0.0001) but not in those with a non-MMC diagnosis (p=0.12). Again only a lack of full or part-time employment (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.95) was independently associated with bladder continence on multivariate analysis.\n\nChu et al most recently assessed the surveillance of kidney function in a study of 5,445 patients registered in the NSBPR between 2013–2018. A total of 3,384 (62.1%) patients underwent at least 1 renal ultrasound and serum creatinine within 2 years of follow-up. The rates for surveillance of kidney function widely varied from 5.5% to 100% among the NSBPR clinics. A younger age (p&lt;0.0001), level of lesion (p=0.001), less mobility status (p&lt;0.0001), augmentation cystoplasty (p&lt;0.0001), and NSBPR clinic (p&lt;0.0001) were each independently associated with surveillane of kidney function on multivariate analysis. The NSBPR clinic remained an indepdendent predictor for surveillance of kidney function in all sensitivity analyses, supporting a wide variation in practice.11\n\nMulti-Institutional Bladder Exstrophy Consortium\n\nMIBEC is a multicenter collaborative that was developed to increase the experience and proficiency in the care of bladder exstrophy among Boston Children’s Hospital, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in 2013. Its objective is to refine the technical aspects and postoperative care for the complete primary repair of bladder exstrophy (CPRE) with the ultimate goal to decrease the complications and improve the long-term outcomes. Each center alternates as the host with observation, commentary, and critique by the visiting surgeons. High-definition video is used to record all surgeries and to facilitate a live local and distant broadcasting for real-time observation.12,13\n\nBorer et al initially assessed the short-term outcomes in a series of 27 consecutive patients during the first 2 years of MIBEC. A total of 13 female and 14 males patietns underwent a CPRE at a median age of 2.3 monghts (range 0.1–51.5). No dehiscences occurred, while the complications varied between male and female patients. A total of 6 female patients developed a complication (pyelonephritis in 5, urinary retention in 4, temporary CIC in 2, cutaneous vesicostomy in 1, and bladder rupture in 1), while 3 male patients developed a complication (urethrocutaneous fistula in 2, pyelonephritis in 1). They observed a higher rate of bladder outlet obstruction in female patients than previously reported in the literature but a comparibly low rate of complications in male patients as well as early signs of continence and spontaneous voiding in both.12\n\nWeiss et al also assessed the continence and dry intervals in a retrospective cohort study of 54 patients who underwent a CPRE prior to MIBEC between May 1993 and January 2013. A total of 35 (64.8%) patients were voiding per urethra, while 18 (33.3%) performed clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and 1 underwent a cutaneous vesicostomy. Of those voiding per urethra, 25 (71.4%) patients did not require any secondary procedures for continence. A total of 26 (48.1%) patients were continent or had a dry interval of at 3 hours, including 11 (20.4%) that were truly continent with voiding per urethra. Only 9 (16.7%) patients were continent with voiding per urethra after a single surgery.13\n\nUrologic Management to Preserve Initial Renal Function Protocol for Young Children with Spina Bifida\n\nUMPIRE is an iterative quality improvement protocol that was developed in 2014 to optimize the urologic management of patients with MMC from the newborn period to 5 years of age. Its objectives are to implement a standardized protocol for newborns with MMC across multiple centers, to determine the adherence to the protocol, to determine if the proposed protocol is optimal to maximize the urologic function while minimizing morbidity, to characterize the deviations from the protocol, and to determine its longitudinal impact on bladder and renal function. The participating centers include Duke University, Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Children's Hospital of Alabama, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Monroe Carrell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt University, Oregon Health Sciences University, Primary Children's Hospital, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Texas Children's Hospital. The study design and protocol have been described previously.14\n\nTanaka et al initially assessed the baseline urinary tract imaging in a study of 193 infants with MMC between 2015–2018. A majority had normal or near normal imaging characteristics, including 2 normal kidneys in 105 (55.9%) patients and SFU grade 1-2 hydronephrosis in at least 1 kidney in 76 (40.4%) patients on renal and bladder ultrasound, no VUR in 154 (84.6%) patients on cystogram, and no renal defects in 61 (92.4%) patients and a difference in the differential renal function &lt;15% in 62 (93.9%) patients on DMSA renal scan.15\n\nWallis et al also sought to assess the incidence and identify the risk factors for UTI in a study of 299 infants with MMC between February 2015 and August 2019. A total of 48 (16.1%) patients were treated for a UTI during the first 4 months of life. However, only 12 (4.0%) met the strict definition for UTI with an abnormal urinalysis (&gt;10 WBC/HPF on urine microscopy and/or leukocyte esterase ≥2+ on dipstick), positive urine culture (≥100,000 CFU/mL of 1 or 2 speciated organisms), and at least 2 symptoms. Patients with SFU grade 3-4 hydronephrosis had a significantly higher risk of UTI compared to those with no hydronephrosis (RR 10.1, 95% CI 2.8–36.3), and patients on CIC had a significantly higher risk of UTI (RR 3.3, 95% CI 1.0–10.5). Patients who received no CAP beyond the perioperative period also had a non-statistically significantly lower risk of UTI (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.1–2.1) and treatment for UTI (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3–1.1) than those who remained on CAP. They concluded that the incidence of UTI was low and questioned the necessity of routine CAP in newborns with MMC.16\n\nTanaka et al most recently assessed the baseline urodynamic findings at or before 3 months of age in a study of 157 patients with MMC between May 2015 to September 2017. There was a concurrence of only 50% for categorization of bladder hostility on primary review, which ultimately reached 100% with further standardization of interpretation. The categorization system was revised to group the “normal” and “safe” categories together as “low risk” as well as to exclude the diagnosis of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia from the high-risk category due to unreliable measurement with surface patch electrodes. The final categorizations were low risk in 38 (24%) patients, intermediate risk in 96 (61%) patients, and high risk in 23 (15%) patients.17\n\nPediatric Urology Robotic Surgery\n\nThe PURS consortium is a multicenter collaborative that was developed at University of Chicago in 2015. Its objective is to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery as a comparable option to traditional open surgery in the pediatric population. The participating centers have varied over time and currently include University of Chicago, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Riley Hospital of Children at Indiana University Health, Seattle Children’s Hospital, Texas Children’s Hospital, and Weill Cornell Medical College.\n\nAvery et al initially assessed the outcomes and complications of robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty in a retrospective cohort study of 60 infants between April 2006 and July 2012. A total of 54 (92%) patients had an improved or resolved hydronephrosis, while 2 patients required additional surgery due to a recurrent obstruction. A total of 7 (11%) patients developed a complication. The mean operative time was 3 hours and 52 minutes (SD ±43 minutes). They concluded that the success and complication rates favorably compared with contemporary series of open and laparoscopic pyeloplasty in infants.18\n\nThe PURS consortium has assessed the outcomes and complications of robot-assisted laparoscopic extravesical ureteral reimplantation as well. Boysen et al conducted a retrospective cohort study of 260 patients (363 ureters) between 2005-2014. The cohort included 90 patients with complex anatomy, including 42 patients with a duplicated collecting system, 40 patients with a failed endoscopic Deflux injection, and 8 patients with a periureteral diverticulum. Of 280 ureters with a postoperative cystogram, 246 (87.9%) had a radiographic success. A total of 25 (9.6%) patients developed a complication, including 7 Clavien-Dindo grade 3 and no grade 4-5 complications. Four (3.9%) patients developed a transient urinary retention after a bilateral surgery.19 Boysen et al subsequently conducted a prospective cohort study of 143 patients (199 ureters) between 2015-2017. The cohort included a grade III-V VUR in 146 (73.4%) and complex anatomy in 59 (29.7%) ureters. Of 145 ureters with a postoperative cystogram, 136 (93.8%) had a radiographic success, including 97 (94.1%) with grade III-V VUR. A total of 16 (11.2%) patients developed a complication, including 8 Clavien-Dindo grade 3 and no grade 4-5 complications. Four (7.1%) patients developed a transient urinary retention after a bilateral surgery. The mean operative time was 194 minutes (SD ±62 minutes). They concluded that the success and complication rates favorably compared with contemporary series of open ureteral reimplantation.20\n\nThe PURS consortium has also published on 90-day complications of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery, outcomes and complications of robot-assisted laparoscopic Mitrofanoff appendicovesicstomy, and outcomes and complications of robot-assisted laparoscopic ureterocalicostomy.21,22,23\n\nPediatric Urologists Researching Surgical Outcomes Using Health Information Technology\n\nThe PURSUIT network is a multicenter colloaborative that was developed at Children’s Hospital Colorado in 2016. Its objective is to study the clinical outcomes and to define the best practices for management of patients with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) through a prospective data collection using tools in the electronic health record (EHR). The participating centers include Children’s Hospital Colorado, Rady Children’s Hospital San Diego, Texas Children’s Hospital, University of Virginia Children’s Hospital, and Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital.\n\nVemulakonda et al initially sought to identify the clinical and demographic factors associated with infant pyeloplasty in a prospective cohort study of 197 infants &lt;6 months of age with SFU grade 3-4 hydronephrosis between 2/1/2018 to 9/30/2019. They noted a significant variability in the rate of infant pyeloplasty among the participating centers as well as a similar rate of improved hydronephrosis over time for patients who were observed and underwent pyeloplasty. These findings suggested the need to standardize the evaluation and indications for pyeloplasty in infants with suspected ureteropelvic junction obstruction.24\n\nVemulakonda et al also assessed the feasibility of a standarized template for clinic visits in patients with congenital hydronephrosis and/or VUR. In a random sample of 230 infants between 1/1/2020 and 4/30/2021, they noted a high amount of agreement (&gt;85%) between manual chart review and data extracted from the EHR.25\n\nPediatric Urology Midwest Alliance\n\nPUMA is a regional multicenter collaborative that was developed among Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health in 2017.\n\nTo determine the feasiblity of this collaborative, Szymanski et al initially assessed the probability of augemtation cystoplatsy or urinary diversion and CIC in a retrospective cohort study of 216 patients with classic bladder exstorphy between 1980 and 2016. They specifically focused on these outcomes due to their clinical relevance and reliable documentation in the medical records and performed a suvival analysis to account for the lost to follow-up and varying ages of patients. Of 212 patients who underwent a primary closure, 108 (50.9%) patients underwent an augmentation cystoplasty and 10 (4.7%) patients underwent a urinary diversion. CIC was performed in 143 patients (67.4%) at the last follow-up, including 65 (85.5%) adults without a urinary divesion. The probability of augmetnation cystoplasty or urinary diversion was 14.9% by 5 years of age, 50.7% by 10 years of age, and 70.1% by 18 years of age on survival analysis. Furthermore, the probability of augmentation cystoplasty or urinary divesion was 60.7% at 10 years after a bladder neck procedure on surviavl analysis. They concluded that these outcomes were much more common than previously reported in the literature.26\n\nUsing a similar approach, McLeod et al then assessed the risk of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and CIC in a retrospective cohort study of 274 patients with posterior urethral valves (PUV) who were treated withint 90 days of life between 1995 and 2005. A total of 42 (15.3%) patients progressed to dialysis or renal transplantation. The nadir serum creatinine in the first year of life was the only independent predictor of RRT on multivariate analysis. After stratification by the nadir serum creatinine, the risk of RRT by 10 years was 0% for &lt;0.4 mg/dL, 2% for 0.4-0.69 mg/dL, 27% for 0.7-0.99 mg/dL, and 100% for ≥1.0 mg/dL on surviavl analysis. CIC was also recommended in 60 (21.9%) patients in follow-up. The risk of CIC was 10% by 10 years of age and 50% by 14 years of age on survival analysis. A younger birth cohort from 2005-2015 (HR 15.3, 95% CI 4.6-51.1), nadir serum creatnine ≥1.0 mg/dL (HR 8.3, 95% CI 3.6-19.2), and anticholinergic use (HR 6.8, 95% CI 2.7-17.2) were each independently associated with risk of CIC on multivariant analysis. They concluded that the risk of RRT and CIC increased with age and that the nadir serum creatinine strongly predicted the need for RRT in the first year of life.27\n\nFuchs et al most recently assessed the long-term urinary and bowel management in a cross-sectional study of 160 patients with cloacal exstrophy or covered variants. A majority of patients were managed with CIC or incontinent urinary diversion. CIC was performed in 29 (83%) patients between 10-18 years of age and 46 (68%) adults, while an incontinent diversion was performed in 3 (9%) patients between 10-18 years of age and 19 (28%) adults. Only 14 (14%) patient were either catheterized or leaking per urethra, while no patients were voiding per urethra with a normal detrusor contraction and intact urinary spihncter. There was no significant difference in the age-adjusted odds of an incontinent urinary diversion among the participating centers or over time. A majority of patients were also managed with an intestinal diversion. An intestinal diversion was performed in 126 (79%) patients, while a pull-through was performed in the remaining 34 (21%) patients in addition to a Malone anterograde continence enama in 16 of these patients. The probability of an intestinal diversion varied significantly among the participating centers with a range of 55-91% but did not significantly change over time. Based on these unpromising results, they questioned the functional goals of pateitns with cloacal exstrophy and suggested that the reconstrucive surgeries by individualized accordingly.28\n\nIn concert with these efforts, PUMA has begun to study their patients with bladder exstrophy and PUV in a prospective fashion. They noted a significant variation in the management and outcomes of patients with PUV among the participating centers.29,30 They therefore developed a standardized clinical assessment and management plan by conducting a survey of pediatric urologists at the participating centers on their general practices and reviewing the available evidence.30 Selected surgeons also began to travel and observe the bladder exstrophy closures among the participating centers with the goal to refine the technical aspects of surgery and to promote an ongoing teaching, surgical coahing, and expertise. Kaefer et al described the use of intraoperative laser angiography to assess the real-time penile perfusion during various stages of closure.31\n\nPrevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) Trial\n\nThe PUSH trial is a multicenter RCT (NCT03244189) on the use of behavioral interventions to increase and maintain a higher fluid intake for prevention of stones. The participating centers are in the Urinary Stone Disease Research Network, including Duke University (sponsor), Children’s Health Texas, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, University of Pennsylvania, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, University of Washington, and Washington University in St. Louis. The study design and rationale as well as the challenges encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic have been described previously.32,33\n\nThe study has completed its enrollment of 1,658 patients and is scheduled to conclude in May 2024. Pediatric and adult patients ≥12 years of age were included with at least 1 symptomatic stone event within 3 years prior to enrollment or within 5 years if a new stone was detected on imaging. They also had a low 24-hour urine volume (defined as less than 2 L per day for patients ≥18 years of age and &lt;25 mL/kg/day for patients &lt;18 years of age). Patients were randomized in a parallel fashion to either an intervention or control arm. All patients received a smart water bottle to self monitor their fluid intake. Those in the intervention arm also underwent 3 behavioral interventions, including a fluid prescription for the additional water they must consume each day, randomly dispersed financial incentive when they reach their daily intake goal, and coaches to assist with overcoming their personal barriers to follow the fluid prescription. The primary outcomes include a stone passage and procedural intervention for a symptomatic or asymptomatic stone; while the secondary outcomes include the formation of new asymptomatic stone, growth of existing stone by &gt;2 mm, 24-hour urine volumes, and cost of procedural interventions.32\n\nPediatric Urology Recovery after SUrgery Endeavor\n\nPURSUE is a prospective, multicenter study (NCT03245242) on Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) for lower urinary tract reconstruction with a possible bowel anastomosis in patients between 4–25 years of age. The participating centers include Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, Children’s Health Texas, Children’s Hospital Colorado, Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Children’s Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Oklahoma Children’s Hospital at Oklahoma University Health, Seattle Children’s Hospital, and St. Louis Children’s Hospital. The study design and ERAS protocol have been described previously.34\n\nThe study has both a pilot and exploratory phase. The pilot phase is designed to assess the success with and barriers to implementation of ERAS in the first 5 patients at each center. The primary outcome is the protocol adherence with the goal of achieving a median of ≥70% protocol adherence per patient at ≥75% centers, while the secondary outcomes include the enrollment of ≥2 patients in the first 6 months of enrollment (to ensure a minimum level of experience with the ERAS protocol) and completion of 90 days of follow-up for the first 5 patients. For the exploratory phase, the enrolled patients will be propensity matched to historical controls in the 5 years prior to implementation of ERAS for comparison of outcomes. The primary outcome is the protocol adherence; while the secondary outcomes include the length of stay, emergency room visits, readmissions, reoperations, complications, pain scores, opioid usage, and differences in Quality of Recovery 9 scores.34\n\nMoore et al most recently assessed the use of regional anesthesia in a subset of 158 patients with MMC who underwent a lower urinary tract reconstruction using an ERAS protocol between 2009 to 2021. Anesthesia setup significantly increased from a median 40 minutes (IQR 34-51) for patients who did not receive any regional anesthesia to 64 minutes (IQR 40-97) for patients who underwent the placement of regional catheters (p&lt;0.01). However, the patients who underwent the placement of regional catheters had a significantly lower median intraoperative opioid use (0.24 vs 0.80 mg/kg morphine equivalents, p&lt;0.01) and lower in-hospital postoperative opioid use (0.05 vs 0.23 mg/kg/day morphine equivalents, p&lt;0.01) with no difference in pain scores. They concluded that patients with MMC benefited from regional anesthesia, despite the false perception of less postoperative pain due to their sensory deficits.35\n\nGonadoblastoma and Invasive Germ Cell Tumors\n\nThe registry is one of 2 open studies that are a part of the Pediatric Urology Working Group. Its objective is to assess the incidence of gonadoblastoma and GCTs in patients with DSD who underwent gonadectomy and to understand the oncologic outcomes for patients who developed a pre-malignant or malignant tumor. The study is actively recruiting participating centers and currently includes University of Kentucky, Children’s Hospital Colorado, and Children’s Hospital &amp; Medical Center Nebraska.\n\nPediatric KIDney Stone Care Improvement Network\n\nPKIDS is a care improvement network comprised of 26 pediatric healthcare systems. The network is conducting a prospective cohort study (NCT04285658) on the effectiveness of ureteroscopy, shockwave lithotripsy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy for kidney and/or ureteral stones in patients between 8–21 years of age. Its objective is to improve the selection of surgical treatment options by incorporating patient-specific factors and outcomes. The excecutive committee includes Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (sponsor), Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, and University of Pennsylania. The conceptual framework and protocol have been described previously.^37.38^\n\nIts enrollment began in February 2020 and is estimated to be completed in January 2024 with the goal of enrolling 1,290 patients. The primary outcome is the stone clearance (defined as absence of residual calculus &gt;4 mm on postoperative ultrasound); while the secondary outcomes include several patient-experience outcomes (patient-reported physical, emotional, and social health outcomes), analgesic use, and use of healthcare resources.36\n\nWestern Pediatric Urology Consortium\n\nWPUC is a regional multicenter collaborative that was developed at Children’s Hospital of Orange County in 2020. There are a total of 19 participating centers, including 3 in Canada, 2 in the eastern US, and the remaining in the western US.\n\nHolzman et al initially assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and management of acute testicular torsion in a study of 221 patients between 2 months and 18 years of age. The median time from the onset of symptoms to presentation significantly increased from 7.5 hours (IQR 4.0–28.0) in the 14 months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to 17.9 hours (IQR 5.5–48.0) during the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.04). The rate of orchiectomy had a corresponding increase from 40 (29%) patients to 34 (43%) patients, respectively (p=0.06).37\n\nYamashiro et al also sought to develop a surgical atlas of techniques for hypospadias repair by assessing the surgical volume and methods for recording operatve notes as well as the technical details for tubularized incised plate distal and proximal hypospadias repairs. A total of 24 (96.0%) surgeons at 12 centers recorded their operative notes in an EHR, of which 16 (66.7%) edited an existing template. They noted a significant variability with the use of surgeon-specific modifications for these 2 types of repairs.38\n\nTraumatic Renal Injury Collaboration for Kids\n\nTRICK is a multicenter collaborative that was developed for pediatric renal trauma in 2021. TRICK has presented at several national meetings but not published to date.\n\nLucas et al initially assessed the follow-up and recommentations for restriction of physical activity in a retrospective cohort study of 328 patients &lt;18 years of age with grades III-V renal trauma at 5 level-1 pediatric trauma centers between 2007–2020. Follow-up occurred at a median of 30.0 days (IQR 11.0–56.0) after discharge with trauma surgery in 110 (33.5%) patients, with urology in 103 (31.4%) patients, and with nephrology in 15 (4.6%) patients. Only 184 (56.1%) patients received any recommendations for return to physical activity, which widely varied in the type of restriction and duration with a median of 5.0 weeks (IQR 2.0–6.0). These findings suggested the need to standardize the follow-up and recommendations for restriciton of physical activty after high-grade renal trauma.39\n\nIn a subsequent retrospective cohort study of 345 patients &lt;18 years of age with high-grade renal trauma over the same period, Lee et al assessed the impact of race and insurance status on their presentation, management, and outcomes. Caucasian patients presented at a signicantly older age than African American patients and those with other races (p=0.001) and with a significantly lower rate of penetrating trauma than African American patients (p=0.002), but there was no differences in the rates of surgery, admission to the intensive care unit, complications, or mortality. Patients with public insurance also had a significantly higher injury severity score (p=0.02) and rate of blood transfusion (p=0.03) than those with private insurance, but there was again no differences in the rates of surgery, admission to the intensive care unit, complications, and mortality.40\n\nTong et al also assessed the utility of excretory-phase computerized tomagraphy (EPCT) in a retrospective cohort study of 343 patietns &lt;18 years of age with high-grade renal trauma during the same period. Patients who underwent an EPCT were significantly more likely to undergo the placement of ureteral stent than those who underwent a non-EPCT (p=0.009), but there was no difference in the length of hospitalization or the rates of delayed imaging, delayed surgical or radiologic intervention, complications, readmissions, or mortality. These findings questioned the utility of EPCT for high-grade renal trauma and suggested the need for additional research to identify those who may benefit from multi-phase CT.41\n\nFlores et al most recently assessed the utility of repeat CT in a retrospective cohort study of 84 patients &lt;18 years of age with isolated grade IV-V renal trauma between 2007–2022. There was no difference in the rates of delayed surgical or radiologic intervention, complications, readmissions, or mortaility in patients who underwent a repeat CT and those who underwent no imaging or only a renal ultrasound. These findings questioend the utility of repeat CT for high-grade renal trauma and suggested the need for pediatric-specific guidelines.42\n\nTable 1 Summary of Multicenter Collaboratives in Pediatric Urology\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name\n      Topic\n      Date of Origin or First Publication\n      Principal Investigator(s)\n      Website\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Gonadoblastoma and invasive GCT in DSD\n      GCT in DSD\n      2017\n      Amanda F.

They have generally been of higher quality with a majority having a large sample size and prospective study design. These types of multicenter collaboratives are critical to advancing the field of pediatric urology.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  The quality of research in pediatric urology is historically low due to a predominance of small retrospective studies at single centers.\n  A multicenter collaboration has a multitude of advantages, including a larger sample size to increase the statistical power (which is particularly important for rare and complex conditions), more generalizability, more evenly distributed workload for research, educational and funding opportunities, building a relationship with the participating centers, and building an area of expertise.\n  Many multicenter collaboratives have recently developed in the US with a higher-quality study design on a wide variety of topics in pediatric urology.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nZee RS, Herbst KW, Kim C, McKenna PH, Bentley T, Cooper CS, et al..

        "title": "Quality Improvement in Pediatric Urology",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nIn 1999, the Institute of Medicine highlighted the need for self-reflection and improvement in medical practices when it reported that preventable errors resulted in nearly 98,000 annual deaths. This striking revelation emphasized the importance of evaluating patient outcomes and devising strategies to improve medical processes and provide safe, effective, and equitable care.1 Over the last few decades, there has been increasing emphasis on quality improvement (QI) and patient safety which has been integrated into medical education and hospital practices. Although initial uptake has been slow, these quality improvement initiatives are becoming more widespread in pediatric urology. This chapter will provide a brief overview of various QI initiatives in pediatric urology and QI methodology. It is important to note the various QI initiatives mentioned below are not comprehensive, and many centers may have QI projects that are not outlined.\n\nQuality Improvement Initiatives in Patient Care\n\nTesticular Torsion\n\nTesticular torsion is a pediatric urologic emergency that affects an estimated 3.8 per 100,000 boys per year. Orchiectomies occur in 41.9% of cases in which the torsed testes are not viable.2 Contributing factors to orchiectomies include delays in presentation, diagnosis, transport, and surgical intervention. Many institutions have implemented QI care pathways to expedite workup of patients presenting with testicular torsions with hopes of reducing time to intervention.\n\nIn 2012, Children’s Medical Center Dallas implemented a straight to operating room (STOR) pathway in which cases of sonographically diagnosed torsion transfers from outside institutions would bypass the emergency room (ER) (Figure 1). These patients are brought to the perioperative area for evaluation after a physician-to-physician conversation between the on-call pediatric urologist and emergency room physician. With pathway activation, the operating room team is mobilized and if surgery is indicated after re-evaluation by the pediatric urology team, consents are obtained, and the patient is taken to the operating room within an hour of arrival. The STOR pathway significantly decreased median arrival to incision time from 94 min to 54 min, but only 46.8% of patients underwent surgical intervention within 6 hours of symptom onset. As such, rates of testicular loss were not significantly different compared to rates prior to pathway implementation. Further process improvements to reduce ischemia time prior to transfer is needed for testicular salvage.3\n\n\nFigure 1 STOR Pathway. Diagram of the Straight to Operating Room Pathway for torsion management at Children’s Medical Center Dallas. Cases of ultrasound confirmed torsions are transferred directly to the perioperative area in preparation for surgical intervention. With this pathway, the emergency room (ER) is bypassed to reduced time to the operating room. Indeterminate cases are transferred to the ER for further urologic evaluation. (Emergency Room - ER; Post-anesthesia care unit – PACU; History and Physical – H&amp;P; Operating Room – OR)\n\nZee et al reported their experience creating an accelerated care of torsion pathway (ACT) to expedite time to surgical intervention for torsions that presented at the Children’s National Medical Center ER. The pathway decreased time from ER triage to the operating room from a median of 196 min to 127 min. However, orchiectomy rates were unchanged, suggesting that despite decreasing time from ER to OR, further work is needed to decrease total testicular ischemia time.4\n\nMany institutions including Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Children’s Hospital Colorado, and others have created management pathways for their ER providers to guide workup of boys presenting with acute scrotums. These pathways help expedite diagnosis of testicular torsion. However, efforts are needed to increase public knowledge of signs and symptoms of testicular torsion to reduce time from symptom onset to medical evaluation.\n\nEnhanced Recover After Surgery\n\nEnhanced Recovery After Surgery pathways promote standardized, evidence-based approaches to post-operative care and aim to improve patients’ recovery processes after major surgery. These pathways have been widely adopted in adult surgical care and have been shown to reduce post-operative length of stay, complication rates, and cost.5,6 In comparison, ERAS implementation in pediatric surgery has been slower, as its efficacy is not well studied in children. The belief that ERAS would yield minimal benefit for pediatric procedures, which generally have low morbidity and mortality, has also slowed development and adoption of standardized pediatric ERAS protocols.7 In the last decade, this sentiment has been changing, and ERAS implementation has increased in children with hopes of improving their post-operative recovery after major surgery.8,9 A survey of pediatric urologists regarding ERAS showed that 54% reported implementing various ERAS elements in post-operative care, although only 20% report having an established protocol at their respective institutions.10\n\nIn pediatric urology, ERAS pathways have been implemented at multiple institutions to improve recovery for children undergoing bladder reconstruction including bladder augmentation, bladder neck reconstruction, or creation of catheterizable channels. Rove et al reported their experience with ERAS at Children’s Hospital Colorado and noted a decrease in post-operative length of stay from 8 to 5.7 days when compared to a historical non-ERAS cohort. They also reported a 30% decrease in risk of complications in the ERAS group (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51–0.97).11 Similarly, Chu et al also noted that length of stay for children undergoing bladder reconstruction decreased from a median of 9 to 4 days following ERAS implementation at Lurie Children’s Hospital, though no significant changes in complication rates were noted.12 These studies suggest that ERAS may be beneficial for children undergoing major bladder reconstruction. A multicenter trial (Pediatric Urology Recovery After Surgery Endeavor) involving over eight centers across the United States is ongoing and is evaluating the efficacy of ERAS in children undergoing bladder reconstruction. Results from this trial will be informative in determining which specific ERAS elements are critical and will help refine future ERAS pathways for this patient population.13 A list of ERAS elements are shown in Figure 2.\n\n\nFigure 2 ERAS Elements. Table of various enhanced recovery elements implemented as a part of institutional Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways. Bolded elements are tracked as a part of the multicenter study PURSUE.\n\nMany ERAS elements including early feeding, early catheter removal, and early mobility are already implemented for patients undergoing ureteral reimplantation and pyeloplasty, a shift from historical practices.7 While standardized protocols do not necessarily exist for these cases, these practice changes reflect ongoing efforts in improving the post-operative care of pediatric urology patients.\n\nPediatric Opioid Use\n\nIn the last several decades, death from opioid overdose has been increasing and is the cause of half of pediatric drug overdose mortalities from 1999–2007.14 In response to the opioid epidemic, many studies have examined post-operative opioid prescription patterns after pediatric urologic procedures, highlighting wide variability in prescription habits amongst providers.15,16 Garren et al further noted that 62% of pediatric urology patients did not need or use the entire opioid prescription provided.17 In response to the opioid epidemic, there has been steady effort amongst pediatric urologists to limit post-operative opioid prescriptions.\n\nMultiple pediatric institutions have utilized the QI framework to minimize opioid prescriptions for outpatient urologic procedures. O’Kelly et al implemented a QI initiative at The Hospital for Sick Children to reduce opioid prescriptions for children undergoing hypospadias repairs. The initiative successfully reduced prescriptions by 56% and noted no significant difference in pain scores or post-operative outcomes.18 Mittal et al implemented a similar initiative at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to reduce opioid prescriptions for patients undergoing ambulatory pediatric urologic procedures. They successfully reduced prescription rates from 43.9% to 2.3% with high patient satisfaction.19 Cardona-Grau et al used the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model and reduced opiate prescriptions following pediatric urologic procedures by 50%. They noted no differences in pain scores following implementation.20 Many other such initiatives are ongoing, and their successes will likely be augmented with state mandates in response to the opiate crisis.21\n\nConcurrent efforts are also being made to improve public education of proper opiate disposal. Garren et al highlighted that 78% of patients did not dispose of excess opiates and few received perioperative counseling regarding proper storage and disposal.17 Butler et al also noted lack of proper opiate disposal following pediatric urologic surgeries despite knowledge of proper methods of doing so. Their study suggests that counseling by a medical professional may improve proper disposal rates, but further QI initiatives are needed to better evaluate this.\n\nTransitional Clinic\n\nChildren with spina bifida often have complex multidisciplinary medical needs and are under the care of pediatric urologists, orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and physical medicine and rehabilitation or developmental and behavioral pediatricians. As medical care has advanced, life expectancy for this population has increased, necessitating the transition of care to adult specialists.22,23 Studies have shown that 20% of youths with spina bifida continue to require caregiver assistance with intermittent catheterization.24 Readiness to transition is associated with patient health literacy, and programs focused on developing this is important.25 Due to multiple reasons, this transition may not always go smoothly. Many patients face issues of establishing care with adult specialists and managing their medical needs in adulthood.\n\nAlthough no set guidelines exist, many institutions have established transitional clinics to assist and guide patients in this process. At Children’s Medical Center Dallas, patients with spina bifida are seen in an adult transitional urology clinic after they reach 18 years of age by a urology provider, nurse, and a social worker. The group noted that youth with neurogenic bladder needed guidance with medication management, navigating medical insurance companies, and managing personal finance. Social work and nursing involvement were vital in assisting with the transition.26 In Halifax, Canada, patients alternate appointments with pediatric and adult urology clinics during the first year of transition.27 At Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, these patients see both pediatric and adult providers in the same clinic space to facilitate the development of physician-patient trust in a familiar and safe environment.22 Many models for transition exist and many institutions including those above have established programs to assist with this challenging and complex process. However, despite the presence of transition clinics, some centers have noted surprising low rates of successful transition, suggesting need for more research and QI initiatives in this endeavor.28\n\nHemorrhagic Cystitis\n\nHemorrhagic cystitis can occur in children who have undergone pelvic radiation or who have thrombocytopenia secondary to chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant. Severe forms of hemorrhagic cystitis result in urinary retention, leading to a vicious cycle of further bladder distention and increasing clot burden. These cases are challenging to manage and have severely negative impacts on the patients’ quality of life.\n\nAs no guidelines exist, a multidisciplinary management approach may be beneficial in severe cases. At Children’s Medical Center Dallas, a hemorrhagic cystitis working group consisting of urologists, oncologists, infectious disease physicians, interventional radiologists, and pharmacists was assembled in 2020 to generate a stepwise approach to these cases. This institutional guideline is currently under development.\n\nReducing OR Waste\n\nReducing waste in the operating room is increasingly important as healthcare costs continue to rise. Many pediatric urologists have promoted standardization of surgical instruments to reduce costs of re-processing. Koyle et al standardized the instrument trays for pediatric hernias used by pediatric surgeons and urologists. They decreased the instrument processing time by half. Although cost reduction was not specifically evaluated, a survey of surgeons and nurses noted improvement in safety, quality, and efficiency.29 Nast and Swords reduced their GU minor instrument tray by 39% and decreased annual costs by $3,489.42 at Rady Children’s Hospital. Using the same approach they further modified other surgical trays and estimated annual potential savings to be $14,588.30 The urology team at Lurie Children’s has also reduced the number of instruments in the surgical trays utilized for groin and penile cases using the DMAIC methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) with positive results (E. Johnson, personal communication, September 29, 2021).\n\nQuality Improvement in Pediatric Urology Training\n\nThe importance of training new physicians in QI is emphasized in pediatric urology. As a part of fellowship, pediatric urology fellows are required to complete an institutional QI project. Through this experiential process, they learn QI methodology and experience the challenges of overcoming institutional implementation barriers and acquiring stakeholder buy-in.31\n\nQI methodology has also been utilized in improving medical education. Sharma et al implemented a QI initiative to improve provider confidence and expertise in evaluating cryptorchidism.32 Cryptorchidism affects 1–3% of term boys and is a known risk factor for testicular cancer development. It can result in decreased fertility if both testes are affected. Timely diagnosis is imperative, but primary care physicians’ comfort and confidence with diagnosis may be variable. The authors surveyed medical students, family medicine practitioners, pediatricians, urology residents and pediatric attendings on baseline training and self confidence in examining undescended testes. This was followed by a proctored exam administered by a pediatric urologist and a follow up survey 3 months later. The intervention improved provider confidence in diagnosis and examination skills.32 As we continue to improve quality of medical education and feedback, similar studies would be helpful to identify learning gaps and enhance urologic training.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nLocal\n\nMany institutions have established institutional QI and patient safety programs as the importance of QI is increasingly recognized. QI consultants help providers design and execute QI initiatives, organize major stakeholder meetings, and collaborate with information technology specialists to use the institutions’ electronic medical record (EMR) systems to sustain these efforts. With automated data extraction through the EMR, audits of QI initiative outcomes can also be more easily performed.33\n\nNational\n\nOn a national level, the American College of Surgeons established the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (ACS NSQIP Peds) to better assess and improve surgical care for children. Participants in NSQIP Peds provide institutional risk-adjusted data on 30-day surgical outcomes which may be used to establish quality metrics. Increasing pediatric urology participation has been encouraged.34\n\nMethodology and Approaches to QI\n\nMultiple resources are available for those interested in further advancing their knowledge on QI methodology. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) offers both in-person and online programs along with a credentialing option to become a Certified Professional in Patient Safety. The American College of Surgeons also offers a self-paced course on the basics of QI approaches. Various institutions offer certificate or Master programs in QI and patient safety for those wishing to pursue advanced degrees in the field.\n\nSquire 2.0\n\nTo provide a framework for reporting quality improvement work, the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) guideline was introduced in 2008. A revised version (SQUIRE 2.0) was introduced in 2015. The guideline encourages authors to expound on the nature and significance of the problem addressed, outline in detail how the intervention was performed such that it is reproducible by others, and assess the intervention’s impact and sustainability.35 Adherence to the SQUIRE 2.0 guideline is increasingly encouraged with QI publications in pediatric urology.36\n\nModel for Improvement and PDSA\n\nDifferent frameworks exist for QI implementation. One such approach is the Model for Improvement which was developed by Associates in Process Improvement.37 Under this framework, the team asks three fundamental questions addressing the aim of the intervention, defining measures to evaluate the effects of the intervention, and identifying areas of change for improvement. The effects of the change or intervention are then tested via the Plan-Do-Study-Act approach (Figure 3) The proposed change is implemented, and the effects assessed. After implementing the intervention on a small scale and evaluating the results, the intervention is then refined and then implemented on a broader scale.37\n\n\nFigure 3 PDSA. Schematic detailing the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) approach.\n\nLean Six Sigma and DMAIC\n\nLean Six Sigma combines the approaches of Lean thinking and Six Sigma. Lean thinking originated from the Japanese automotive industry and is focused on reducing waste. With this approach, one first studies the process that requires improvement and reduces wasteful processes.38 Six Sigma is a structured approach to process and quality improvement that originated in manufacturing industries. The combination of the two approaches is known as Lean Six Sigma. Under this framework, teams approach QI projects through five phases: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control (Figure 4) In the Define phase, the issue to be addressed is identified. Baseline data is gathered during the measure phase. In the analyze phase, the root cause to the problem is deciphered and measures for improvement are implemented. In the control phase, implemented changes are maintained.39\n\n\nFigure 4 DMAIC. Schematic detailing the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control approach.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nQuality improvement is gaining momentum in pediatric urology, but there is still a long way to go. Compared to standard clinical research, the methodology, implementation process, and management of global and institutional implementation barriers are especially critical in the success of QI projects. While journals including the Journal of Pediatric Urology are publishing more QI papers, these publications are still wanting in urologic literature. A discussion platform for QI enthusiasts in pediatric urology can help propel projects forward as we collectively navigate implementation barriers and learn from each other’s experiences and struggles. The relative rarity of pediatric urologic conditions also makes defining “quality” challenging as we are limited by the presence of high quality evidence to support best practices.36 However, implementation of data-driven practices may help better assess their efficacy and safety as we continue to challenge dogma. As pediatric urologists, our involvement and leadership in QI is critical as we strive for continuous improvement and move our field forward.\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Institute for Healthcare Improvement\n  Hannick JH, O’Kelly F, Wolfstadt JI.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nIncreasingly, there is broad recognition that clinical expertise and information technology expertise do not always overlap, especially as the separate domains have marched down the road of sub-specialization. Have you ever struggled to convey to the help desk what is not working in the electronic medical record (EMR)? Has an EMR \"upgrade\" ever felt like a clinical workflow \"downgrade?\" This is a gap experienced by most healthcare organizations, and more and more organizations are setting up clinical informatics programs to close that gap.\n\nA clinical informaticist (sometimes referred to as an informatician), is a clinical provider with specialty knowledge and training in clinical information systems, usually focused on the EMR. Clinical informatics has expanded in the last decade into a specialty of its own, complete with training and board certification. Some specialties have relied on such specialists for much longer than urology or surgery, including pathology (laboratory systems interfaces) and radiology (PACS interfaces). But as s EMRs advance and more of our workflows are digitized, even surgeons are affected by the aforementioned gap, and it is increasingly imperative to have surgical providers trained in the EMR to be at the table for decisions that affect our practice.\n\nClinical informatics can also be defined by what it is not: physicians using a computer, physicians who use clinical software (at any level of expertise), or physicians performing data analysis or research. Historically, the young field of clinical informatics has struggled to convey what it is that we do, and stating what we are not is a useful exercise to emphasize the definition. Figure 1 demonstrates some of the overlap and functions of clinical informatics with the field of analytics. Similarly, Figure 2 shows how overlap between the health care system, clinical care, and information technology and systems leads to different domains of expertise with clinical informatics at the center.\n\n\nFigure 1 Clinical informatics as a domain has some overlap and relationship with analytics (which in many healthcare systems is nacent), but each has unique elements distinct from the other.\n\nFigure 2 Overlapping domains in and around clinical care differentiate clinical\n   informatics from domains such as quality improvement and patient safety and the information technology help desk. Clinical informatics sits at the intersection of the three larger domains, clinical care, the healthcare system and information and communications technology.\n\nDefining EMR—What It Is\n\nThere are various terms used to refer to computerized medical records, including the title of this review, electronic medical record (EMR). But what constitutes an EMR? EMRs may consist of a single, large application (e.g., Epic or Cerner or AllScripts) licensed and maintained by a care delivery organization like a hospital or or private clinic, or they can also consist of multiple, separate applications. The term electronic health record (EHR) is occasionally used synonymously with EMR, but it is defined as a separate, discrete concept of a patient-facing portal that allows access to records from multiple health care delivery organizations and unifies the information in a single place. Table 1 provides a comparison of EMR, EHR, and health information exchanges (HIE), which are also becoming increasingly important regionally to aid with efficient and timely electronic, secure information exchange between organizations.\n\nBeyond defining EMR, there are also measures of how advanced the capabilities and integrations are within the EMR, defined by HIMSS.1 By defining these stages, organizations can benchmark their capabilities (features and integrations that impact patient safety, data security, and clinician efficiency/satisfaction) against one another. Each stage definition1,2,3,4,5,6,7 includes that stage’s capabilities plus all the lower stages. The most advanced stage is HIMSS stage 7. These are shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 1 Differences between an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and an Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Health Information Exchange (HIE). EMRs may consist of a single, large application (e.g., Epic or Cerner) owned and maintained by a care delivery organization like a hospital or hospital system or private clinic, or they can also consist of multiple applications. An HIE, in contrast, aids the sharing of information between EMRs using standardized terminologies (e.g., ICD-10 and SNOMED for diagnoses, CPT for procedures, LOINC codes for lab tests, etc). HIEs are increasingly common. Examples of an EHR include Apple Health or Google Health, which can collect and integrate information securely from multiple entities.\n\n\n  \n    \n      EMR\n      EHR\n      HIE\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Care delivery organization (hospital, hospital system, clinic) owned\n      Patient or stakeholder owned\n      Independent entity with agreements with multiple organizations to automatically share standardized information (e.g., medications, immunizations, notes, discharge summaries, labs, among others)\n    \n    \n      Contains legal medical record for a single organization\n      Subset of records pertaining to a single patient spanning multiple organizations\n      Facilitates exchange of information with member organizations\n    \n    \n      Single organization\n      May span local, regional, and national areas\n      May span local, regional, and national areas (e.g., CORHIO HIE in state of Colorado)\n    \n    \n      Integrated or multiple applications\n      Interactive interface (web portal or mobile application, typically used by patients)\n      Interactive interface (web portal or mobile application, typically used by providers within member organizations) or may directly integrate/send/receive data into organization EMR\n    \n  \n\n\nTable 2 HIMSS stages of EMR capabilities.

This has also led to a dramatic lengthening of documentation as EMRs make it very easy to pull this information into a note.2,3,4,5 The unintended consequence of this is the tendency for clinicians to include redundant information verbatim (e.g., entire renal bladder ultrasound report) in their clinic and inpatient progress notes instead of summarizing and noting the significance of said result—leading to a doubling of clinic note lengths since 2009.6\n\nClinical informaticists are well positioned to positively impact this by encouraging the use of and creating documentation templates within the EMR. Why is this important? Too often, clinicians repeat mundane tasks over and over, without realizing or understanding that the EMR can automate tasks and work. A great example of this is when patients with common pediatric urology problems are seen in clinic (e.g., hypospadias, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteral reflux, bowel and bladder dysfunction). If you find yourself having the same conversation with patients and families and presenting similar options, a clinical note template can turn 10 minutes “re-creating the wheel” to document said conversation into a 30–60 second exercise of filling out key details in a clinical note template that is saved in the EMR.\n\nTable 3 provides a list of new patient shared note template outpatient phenotypes at my organization. Note the word shared: Our group has elected to create this shared resource to all providers. The benefit of sharing is that we have standardized the documentation for ~95% of new patients, which fall into this list, and all providers benefit as issues are corrected and the template is refined.\n\nTable 3 List of new patient shared note templates at Children’s Hospital Colorado as of 2023.\n\n\n  \n    \n      New patient templates\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Anorectal\n    \n    \n      Differences of sexual development\n    \n    \n      Dysfunctional voiding\n    \n    \n      Dysuria\n    \n    \n      Generic\n    \n    \n      Hematuria\n    \n    \n      Hernia / hydrocele\n    \n    \n      Hydronephrosis\n    \n    \n      Hypospadias\n    \n    \n      Labial adhesions\n    \n    \n      Newborn phimosis\n    \n    \n      Nocturnal enuresis\n    \n    \n      Penis\n    \n    \n      Prenatal consult\n    \n    \n      Scrotal pain / mass / swelling\n    \n    \n      Spinal defect\n    \n    \n      Stones\n    \n    \n      Testicular mass / microlithiasis\n    \n    \n      Undescended testicle\n    \n    \n      Urachal issue\n    \n    \n      UTI\n    \n    \n      Varicocele / spermatocele\n    \n    \n      Vesicoureteral reflux\n    \n  \n\n\nCreation of Discrete Data\n\nAn enormous advantage the EMR holds over paper records lies within structured, or discrete, data. One may think of discrete data as information that has been parsed into its base elements, labeled, and stored such that it can be easily accessed. Within the EMR, much of the data important for clinical documentation has already been captured in this way—dates, names, vital signs, lab values, diagnoses, etc. Such data can facilitate direct patient care and can be leveraged for secondary uses including outcomes tracking and clinical research.\n\nIt is generally simple to pull discrete data into notes. When doing so, physicians must be mindful to avoid note bloat and structure their templates to focus solely on the pertinent data. Discrete data within an EMR are highly granular, and with enough customization discrete data elements can be incorporated into a note without sacrificing readability. For instance, rather than importing a full set of recent lab tables, one can template a sentence to include only the most recent creatinine value and the date it was collected.7\n\nClinical Decision Support\n\nClinical decision support (CDS) is defined as a “process for enhancing health-related decisions and actions with pertinent, organized clinical knowledge and patient information to improve healthcare and healthcare delivery.”8 EMR data on a patient can be leveraged to recommend a specific action or highlight important information. Pop-up alerts are a common form of CDS. Table 4 lists common CDS types, tools, and examples within pediatric urology.\n\nTable 4 Clinical decision support (CDS) examples within pediatric urology.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Category\n      Tool\n      Benefit\n      Example\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Data entry\n      Smart form (dynamic, guided data entry)\n      Dynamically prompt collection of key, discrete data\n      Pediatric urodynamics data entry that adjusts based on procedures/documented conditions\n    \n    \n       \n      Order sets\n      Standardize order entry for patient condition\n      Postoperative Pediatric Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) order set\n    \n    \n      Data review\n      Pediatric urology ambulatory nursing dashbaord\n      Centralizes assigned tasks and provides global assessment of duties\n      Lists pending postoperative calls, patient teaching tasks, inbox message pool review, and other indirect care tasks (e.g., tracking ureteral stents)\n    \n    \n      Assessment and understanding\n      Informational buttons, embedded links to educational materials\n      Provides on-the-spot educational opportunity for a clinician\n      Providing a link to pediatric urology-specific surgical antibiotic prophylactic guidelines within an order set\n    \n    \n      Triggered by user task\n      In-line workflow alerts\n      Helpful for common notifications\n      Flu vaccination prompts\n    \n    \n       \n      Pop-up, interruptive alerts\n      Useful for important messages where an action is highly recommended\n      Suggested medication change because the selected one is out of stock\n    \n    \n       \n      Automated inbox notification\n      Alert providers to required pending action\n      Reminder to finish documentation on an open chart\n    \n  \n\n\nThe “five rights” of CDS are important to consider in designing and building new tools: 1) right information, 2), right person, 3) right intervention format, 4) right channel, 5) right time/workflow (Table 5).9 These concepts help to focus the tool to avoid interrupting the wrong team members at the wrong times with interventions that are not effective. While historically, CDS tools have not always improved efficiency, as time marches on, we suspect this will improve.10,11,12\n\nTable 5 Five rights of CDS.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Right\n      Explanation\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Right information\n      Information should be presented to the user that is ideally evidence-based (e.g., guideline) while avoiding too many details\n    \n    \n      Right person\n      Modern healthcare is team based and interventions should be targeted at the correct team member who can take action\n    \n    \n      Right intervention format\n      An appropriate tool from Table 2 should be selected that aids the user\n    \n    \n      Right channel\n      Increasingly, there are EMR interfaces throughout the healthcare environment, a desktop clinic session, operating room flight board, handheld devices, printed patient lists, and more. CDS designers should select an optimal channel for the intervention.\n    \n    \n      Right time/workflow\n      Interventions should be targeted and tested in real-world scenarios to ensure they are delivered at the correct time and in the correct workflow to be effective.\n    \n  \n\n\nInformatics Training\n\nClinical informatics is now taught through formal training programs that are GME-accredited. Board certification is available for those who wish to formalize their training.13 There are currently two pathways available to board certification (which is granted after passing a written exam) through the American Board of Preventative Medicine: 1) clinical informatics training pathway where you can sit for the board after completing graduate medical education (GME) certified training (typically one year), or 2) practice pathway that allows those with formal roles in your organization with at least 0.25 full-time equivalent dedicated time. The latter is available through 2023 (but this grandfather clause has been extended several times, recognizing that not all clinical informaticists have received formal training, but rather have gone through on-the-job training). More information about board certification requirements for clinical informatics is available through the American Board of Preventative Medicine.\n\nEMR Governance\n\nGiven the complexity of the EMR, particularly in ones with integrated outpatient, lab, pharmacy, inpatient, ED, OR functionality, changes to the EMR cannot be made by a small team without input from the organization. Many hospitals and systems with large EMRs have set up governance committees that discuss and decide on major changes that might impact a broad swath of users. Serving on these committees can provide valuable insight into new features of an EMR, may help you stave off a change that might negatively impact your team, or provide a venue to discuss a feature or build that might benefit your group or organization.\n\nInformatics Leadership and Help Desk\n\nMany physicians have expressed frustration at not knowing where to start when there are issues or frustration with the current state of affairs. Knowing your IT and informatics leadership is a good place to begin. Many organizations (big and small) have someone designated to lead the IT team (perhaps called a Chief Information Officer or CIO). There is also likely someone clinical designated to liaise with the CIO to represent clinicians. At many organizations, this is a Chief Medical Informatics Officer or CMIO. Knowing who these people are at your organization is half the battle. Asking them to include designated persons to represent your interests is also key. These designated representatives should have an interest in informatics (if not formal training) and be empowered to make decisions on behalf of your group, while also serving as someone who can help facilitate change, which has emerged as a constant new normal in the EMR era.\n\nBeyond engaging with key leaders at your health care organization, half the battle of EMR issues stems from a variation on the economics concept of “tragedy of the commons.” This is where a shared resource (in this case, the EMR) is allowed to fester secondary to the prioritization of self-interest (read: precious clinician time and the assumption that others are handling an issue) over the attention to and betterment of said resource. More directly, when users encounter unexpected results in the EMR (unknown new error or functionality that is broken), we observe that most users work around the issue rather than report it to the help desk. Because IT staff are not clinicians, many of these issues in the EMR can go undetected for days or more because no one reports it to the help desk. Do not assume that others have reported the issue. To address the time it takes to call the help desk, delegate the task of notifying the help desk to a staff member (medical assistant, for example) while providing them with enough information to convey the issue.\n\nConclusion\n\nClinical informatics is an increasing important area of practice for urologists. Having a member of your team or group who can represent your interests and seek additional training to be an expert in this area is likely to pay dividends in terms of efficiency, productivity, and minimize friction between your team and the EMR.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Clinical informatics is a new field that leverages and bridges the gap between clinical care and information technology systems (with a particular focus on the EMR)\n  EMRs have increasingly integrated features to make it easier to access radiology, pharmacy, clinical decision support, laboratory, documentation functionality that covers outpatient, inpatient, perioperative and emergency department care (HIMSS level 7)\n  The additional complexity has required that organizations invest in clinical informatics teams to ensure more efficient utilization of the EMR that mirrors existing workflows and practices.\n  Knowing your information technology (CIO) and informatics (CMIO) leaders are key to ensuring your interests are represented.\n  Call the help desk when you encounter something unexpected. Do not fall trap to tragedy of the commons and think that someone else has reported the issue.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAnon. Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model (EMRAM).

        "title": "Ethical Dilemmas and Considerations",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nAll of pediatric urological care involves the application of ethical principles on a daily basis. Occasionally, those principles are spotlighted as we push therapeutic envelopes further, societal thinking evolves or medical advances challenge legal (or even political) thinking. Gender affirming therapies represent such an arena as care for the transgender population has developed rapidly and unevenly throughout our country. Similarly, care for neonates and infants with disorders of sexual differentiation (DSD) has become a focus for social and political activism, potentially influencing treatment. Both areas have assumed ethical importance for the principles upheld.\n\nAs we will discuss, the ethical concepts guiding transgender care—justice, beneficence and autonomy—are magnified. For neonates and infants with DSDs, for whom gender-related surgery is considered, these same principles apply but with different, powerful tensions. For both, informed consent takes on particular importance.\n\nEthical Principles\n\nBeneficence\n\nIn biomedical ethics, the concept of beneficence encompasses actions intended to provide net benefit to a patient.1 These actions include protecting patient rights, rescuing a patient from danger, and providing treatment to reduce patient discomfort. Beneficence means that those treatments with which the benefits outweigh the harms should be offered to patients. When the goal of medical treatment is to have an overall positive effect on patient health it is sometimes unclear what treatments may best benefit a patient, in which case beneficence may require shared decision making, wherein a medical practitioner presents options and the patient and practitioner choose together the best course of action.\n\nPaternalism is the concept that an individual with power (in this case a medical professional) relies on their own judgement in making decisions for someone with less power (in this case the patient).1 Paternalism can result if the principle of beneficence is followed too closely and subjectively. In pursuing beneficence, a medical practitioner might allow their judgement of the most beneficial course of action to supersede patient preferences.2 Thus, while it is important to uphold the principle of beneficence, it is equally important to balance it with other ethical principles discussed later in the chapter.\n\nNon-Maleficence\n\nNon-maleficence is the ethical principle describing not inflicting harm on a patient.1 In biomedical ethics, patients ideally are not hurt by their medical care. Harm is a broad term, which includes offense, annoyance, discomfort, or other negative outcomes which may or may not occur due to wrongdoing. Unlike beneficence, which involves actively doing good or preventing harm, non-maleficence involves avoiding actions which might cause harm or balancing the risks and benefits of a given action. The principle of non-maleficence requires that healthcare providers not impose harm or risks of harm. Harm can occur both unintentionally as a result of actions or inactions or can be a result of reckless behavior that puts a patient at risk. It is the responsibility of healthcare providers to avoid hasty decision making and rash behavior as well as to anticipate potential negative outcomes of therapy and attempt to prevent them. In the context of pediatric care, this may involve anticipating problems that may result from childhood treatment when patients become adults and attempting to mitigate these problems. This may also require healthcare providers to delay irreversible or potentially difficult treatments until patients reach an age at which they are better able to participate in discussions regarding such treatments.\n\nJustice\n\nThe principle encompassing fairness within biomedical ethics is justice.1 Justice implies that every patient should have equivalent access to medical care regardless of where they live, their background, or their financial circumstances. Consistency in allocating therapies is an important aspect of justice in medical care. Local laws may vary throughout a country compromising justice in the delivery of medical care. In areas where there are laws preventing the use of certain therapies in pediatrics, for example, pediatric patients may be legally unable to receive treatment that is available in other parts of the country. Thus, when local laws run contrary to the best possible provision of care, it may be incumbent on medical practitioners to advocate, lobby, or otherwise pursue a more just distribution of medical care.\n\nIt is especially important to employ the principle of justice in treating potentially vulnerable patients, such as the pediatric population. Younger pediatric patients may not understand the benefits and harms of medical therapies, and adolescent patients have not yet achieved the maturity to be fully autonomous. Additionally, preventing exploitation or coercion of vulnerable patients falls under the principle of justice. Thus, patients who are legally unable to make decisions themselves must be evaluated for evidence of such coercion. Thus, in providing medical care to a vulnerable population practitioners must consider the bioethical principle of justice, provide care in a fair and equal manner, and prevent coercion of patients.\n\nAutonomy/Respect for Persons\n\nRespect for persons, also called respect for autonomy, is the moral principle guarding an individual’s right to self-determination.1 The right to make one’s own health care decisions benefits individuals with capacity, allowing them to take control of their medical care. Adults with capacity are clearly able to understand the consequences of decisions that they make. However, in the adult population, capacity can be temporarily or permanently compromised by illnesses, ignorance or coercion. In contrast to adults, it is less clear in the pediatric population when a patient becomes able to fully comprehend medical decision making. As pediatric patients approach adulthood, they increasingly have opinions and desires for independent decision making. However, parents are typically involved in the unemancipated child’s decision making until they reach the legal age of majority (18 years in the USA). This means that healthcare professionals must navigate respect for the wishes of both the pediatric patient and their parents. When these wishes align, it is far easier to provide medical care than when they are at odds. Ethical dilemmas arise when pediatric patients have preferences that are contrary to their caregivers’ expectations.\n\nAutonomy involves individuals acting with intention, able to understand their actions and without coercive influences. Responsibility for respect for persons can fall on the healthcare worker. This involves not only providing options and respecting individuals desires. Healthcare workers may be responsible for advocating for patients’ care or providing education to facilitate informed consent. In the case of the pediatric population health care workers may find themselves advocating for the best possible care for the patient, educating a patient and their caretakers or seeking legal authority when caretakers’ preferences conflict with what appears to be the child’s best interests.\n\nDisorders of Sexual Differentiation\n\nManagement of the patient with DSD can be medically and surgically complex. But undoubtedly the aspect of care that is most ethically fraught is gender assignment in the setting of genital ambiguity.\n\nFor a neonate or infant, the first issue is to determine who the appropriate decision-maker should be. The law calls for an adult surrogate decision-maker. Historically, the parents have been regarded as the rightful parties based on a “best interests” standard which is believed to represent what reasonable persons would consider the highest net benefit among the available options.1 The law has assumed that parents generally do act in their child’s best interests and thus the state should be reluctant to interfere. It is also generally believed that only the parents can fully understand the values inherent to their family in assessing medical priorities.\n\nThere are two challenges to the principle of parents as rightful surrogate decision-makers for their child. The first is based on the qualifications for surrogate decision-making, of which there are four: 1) competency—the ability to make reasonable judgements; 2) emotional stability; 3) partiality toward the patient’s interests and 4) adequate knowledge and information. In the setting of decision-making for the infant with DSD the greatest challenge for most surrogates would be the 4th qualification—adequate understanding to make the best decision. This is not necessarily a function of intelligence or educational level of the parent but limitations in medical understanding of these conditions. This qualification places the burden on the treating physician team to provide thorough and understandable information so that the parents feel informed in their consent to treat.\n\nThe second challenge to parental surrogate decision-making relates to the limits of those decisions. One might argue that gender is so fundamental to the individual that allowing anyone other than the patient, themselves, to significantly influence that personal characteristic is inappropriate. This line of thought is consistent with preserving “an open future” for the adult whom the infant will become.\n\nAssuming a scenario in which the parents feel well-informed and comfortable with the responsibility of surrogate medical decision-making for their child, one might consider the potential surgical decisions to be made. The most common DSD diagnosis that raises surgical questions is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in the 46XX female, in which external genitalia are virilized prenatally due to supraphysiologic levels of Testosterone (T).3 This can result in clitoromegaly and formation of a urogenital sinus into which both vagina and urethra drain. Internally, the child is an anatomically normal female. The elevated T levels raise the possibility that brain hormonal imprinting may occur, although very rarely do these patients identify as male when the diagnosis is made in the neonatal period. So, the potential surgical issues facing the virilized female include exteriorization of the vagina, which is medically necessary in the long run for reproductive tract function and clitoral reduction which may be psychologically important but not necessarily medically essential. In addition, future fertility as a female has supported maintenance of female gender in the more virilized cases.\n\nAn important principle in the management of children with DSD’s, consistent with preservation of future options, is to avoid irreversible surgical procedures.4 For the child with CAH, exteriorization of the vagina is a reversible procedure in the sense that vaginectomy could be performed should that child identify as male later in life. Clitoral reduction, on the other hand, would represent an irreversible procedure as it entails removal of hypertrophic erectile tissue which cannot currently be replaced. Of these two procedures, vaginoplasty is certainly the more time sensitive, as it can be performed with considerably less morbidity and greater safety in the young child, aged 6 to 18 months. Clitoral reduction can be performed safely in pubertal females at an age of meaningful assent and established gender identity, thereby protecting the autonomous decision-making of the patient, themselves.\n\nThe dilemma confronting parents of a child with CAH (or another DSD) and genital ambiguity is determining for themselves what represents the best interests of their child. Postponement of a decision regarding surgery entails selection of a pathway that will have its own implications for the child’s development. Little data exists about the effects of external genital ambiguity on the psychological development of the child. Therefore, those who might argue in favor of a surgical moratorium for these disorders (as has occurred in Europe) have acted with missing information about its consequences. In the absence of greater medical certainty, deference to the decisions of the parental surrogate decision-makers seems respectful and reasonable.5\n\nCare for the Gender Non-Conforming Population\n\nThe pediatric transgender and gender nonconforming population represents a group in which there are several ethical conundrums for medical providers. In the adult population with gender dysphoria, it is usually clear that the patient, themselves, should be making choices related to gender affirming therapies. However, in the pediatric population, it may be less clear whether patients fully understand decisions, requiring consideration for respect for persons.1 Additionally, it is important to work with parents and caregivers to maximize care and minimize harm thereby embodying the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence.1 Finally, attempting to provide optimal gender affirming care for all gender dysphoric individuals regardless of age embodies the principle of justice.1\n\nParental Involvement\n\nCare in the pediatric population is typically overseen by a parent or guardian who has influence over the decisions made by the pediatric patient or makes decisions on their behalf. The bioethical construct of respect for persons is therefore relevant as healthcare providers attempt to deliver gender affirming care for minor patients. Because lack of gender affirming care can have such a negative psychological impact, it is imperative to work with patients and their caregivers to deliver treatment.6 Parents typically make decisions with their child’s best interest in mind but sometimes, especially in emotionally charged situations, parental decision-making can be compromised.7 In situations in which the minor and parents are at odds, there is precedent for facilitating care of the minor when they may experience significant distress at not receiving such care,6,8\n\nParental involvement is important in the care of the pediatric or adolescent transgender patient and is associated with improved physical and mental health outcomes in this population.9 Thus, a key role for medical professionals in providing transgender care is encouraging parental support of pediatric transgender patients. Interestingly, one study demonstrated that transgender children and adolescents rated the support they received from their parents higher than the parents rated their ability to provide that support.9,10 This finding may indicate that parents are able to fulfill a supportive role for their children despite discomfort with the transition process. It is thus important for medical practitioners to evaluate caregiver attitudes and promote supportive behaviors in this population.\n\nOne study evaluated parents’ and caregivers’ reactions to what the authors termed “pivotal moments” in the development of their child’s gender identity.9,10 These events included learning of a patient’s gender identity, the child’s desire for a name or pronoun change, hearing descriptions of their child’s gender dysphoria and hearing their child express interest in topics related to gender identity.9,10 Many parents reported requiring time to adjust to these changes with an initial negative reaction followed by acceptance. These “pivotal moments” correspond with topics that may be discussed as part of a transgender child’s medical appointments and thus it is incumbent on medical providers to facilitate communication between patients and their caregivers and to promote caregiver acceptance.10\n\nTransition to Adult Care\n\nAn interesting aspect of the pediatric population is that they are initially managed by pediatric specialists but will, presumably in their late teens or early twenties, transition to care by adult practitioners. The need for transition to adult care uniquely impacts the principle of beneficence because there is a need to balance provision of high-quality care between pediatric and adult specialists. Patients come to trust their pediatric practitioners and surgeons and may struggle with the transition to adult care. A team-based approach including input from providers and surgeons who care for adults may improve this transition.\n\nSurgical Considerations\n\nTransgender individuals may consider gender affirming surgeries while they are minors. The availability of gender affirming surgery for minors falls into the ethical principles of justice and respect for persons. While pediatric patients are generally considered unable to make such decisions, the timing at which adolescents can adequately understand the permanence of surgical interventions remains hotly debated. The most just condition would permit such options to be available to transgender and gender non-conforming patients as soon as they achieve the maturity to fully understand the implications of their decisions. This availability would also maximize respect for persons. However, it is unclear exactly at what age individuals achieve the required maturity and it likely varies from person to person. One California-based study, conducted to evaluate referral patterns for gender affirming services between 2015 and 2018, included 104 instances of gender affirming surgeries in minors, which were typically performed between the ages of 14 and 18.11 A majority of these surgeries were gender affirming mastectomies but there were instances of hysterectomy, vaginoplasty and phalloplasty/metoidioplasty among this population.11 Advantages of surgical management in minors include patients completing physical transition with parental support and prior to leaving home for college or work. However, given the permanence of such surgeries, which typically entail sterilization, many practitioners defer surgical management until after the age of majority.8 A focus on maximizing future options provides useful guidance. In many cases, simply blocking puberty until a person reaches adulthood leaves surgical options open while allowing a person to socially transition and prevents unwanted secondary sexual changes to their body associated with their sex of birth.\n\nFertility\n\nGender affirming so-called “bottom” surgeries, typically entail gonadectomy and are therefore sterilizing procedures. Considerations of future fertility involve the principle of beneficence and non-maleficence. Thus, assessing attitudes of transgender individuals toward future fertility is important in providing proper care. In one survey administered to adolescent transgender and nonbinary individuals, about 16% expressed a desire for future biological children.12 However, some individuals express gender dysphoria associated with fertility preserving procedures, such as a visit to a sperm bank.12 Thus, the balance between beneficence and non-maleficence may be challenging. On the one hand, some transgender youths desire future biological children and may wish to preserve this option. On the other hand, fertility preservation may induce feelings of gender dysphoria. Shared decision making is paramount in carefully presenting options when discussing fertility in this population. Furthermore, deferring sterilizing therapies until after fertility decisions have been made remains prudent.\n\nLegal Aspects\n\nLaws have the potential to both positively and negatively impact justice for transgender and gender non-conforming individuals. Laws limiting gender-affirming therapies, even when recommended or overseen by health practitioners, will reduce options for gender non-conforming individuals, especially when they are written in such a way as to prevent even temporary therapies. Additionally, discriminatory laws that are enacted locally may reduce availability of such therapies, which is also unjust. On the other hand, laws aimed at punishing discrimination or bullying may positively impact patients.\n\nAs of 2021, 22 states had introduced legislation limiting gender-affirming medical care in the pediatric population and 1 state, Arkansas, had passed such legislation.13,14 Some of the introduced laws block gender-affirming therapy even with parental permission.13 Medical practitioners have criticized this type of legislation, noting that it politicizes medical care and legally mandates care that is a departure from accepted practice standards.13 Furthermore, practitioners have noted that these laws adversely impact patients’ mental health and reduce these patients’ access to healthcare.13 These laws may reduce or eliminate insurance coverage for patients desiring gender transition.14\n\nLaws regulating treatment of gender diverse individuals also dissuade providers due to fear of legal consequences for provision of care.13 Laws, such as Arkansas HB1570, allow for legal action against medical practitioners who prescribe gender affirming therapies to be brought by a patient’s parents throughout childhood and by the patient themselves for 20 years into adulthood.14 Laws of this type may dissuade practitioners from treating gender diverse individuals or impact their specialty choice.13 Additionally, it is likely that individuals interested in practicing gender affirming medicine will preferentially locate in states that do not have such laws. The principle of justice requires availability of practitioners so that care is readily available to gender dysphoric individuals that require it. Thus, laws such as this adversely impact just medical care.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe principles of bioethics have a significant impact on the delivery of pediatric surgical care. When attempting to provide just care with respect for patient autonomy, the pediatric population is particularly vulnerable due to their legal status as minors and actual or perceived mental and emotional immaturity. These challenges in providing ethical pediatric care are highlighted by the DSD and gender non-conforming patient populations. Balancing patient preferences and parental expectations may contribute to ethical dilemmas for the pediatric medical provider. Additionally, ethical care provision may be further complicated by local laws. A focus on non-permanent options prior to the age of majority, shared decision making and a team-based approach when transitioning to adult care can alleviate ethical difficulties relating to care in these populations.\n\nSuggested Readings\n\n\n  Beauchamp TL, Childress JF.

        "title": "Leadership and Training in Pediatric Urology",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nA frequently asked question of medical leaders and in particular surgical leaders is why would you give up some of your surgical practice to attend meetings. With sometimes a not too subtle subtext, some might imply perhaps you went into administration because you were unable to do surgery! While certainly that was considered true decades ago, for the authors who have over 20 years of administrative experience, we certainly hope that is not the case today.\n\nIn general, a surgeon’s career can be divided into 3 parts: after completing training the first part consists of honing ones skill, developing your own particular techniques, style and creating, in many peoples’ practice a clinical and or research niche. The second is when you are comfortable in your skill you have a definite competency and can provide excellent care and pass on your knowledge to others. Then there is the third—for some this is a continuation of excellent clinical care or research and for others it is the business side of medicine, especially if the surgeon is in private practice. For those less fortunate it is biding time until retirement. But one option available is to go into medical leadership.\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to outline some of the reasons and benefits and give some guidance as to the necessary roles and skills of a good surgical leader. It is important to realize that being a “good leader” does not necessarily mean that the leader has an official title or position, although it can. A good leader is someone who exercises the quality of a leader in their daily practice within the team. These qualities are vital for a successful career in surgery regardless of whether the person chooses to take on a more formal leadership role. After all, a surgeon acts as the leader (or should act as the leader) every time they are in the operating room.\n\nThis is one chapter and not meant to be the definitive text on the matter. In fact there have been books written on almost every section outlined in this chapter and consequently there is an additional reading list at the end of this chapter that we recommend to interested readers.\n\n\n  “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, concerned citizens can change the world. Indeed it is the only thing that ever has.” —Margaret Mead\n\n\nWhy become a surgical leader\n\nBefore addressing the reasons for becoming a surgical leader with a formal title, it is important to realize that all surgeons, in practice, have a leadership role. Whenever a surgeon runs a clinic or has patients undergoing surgery then they are part of a very complex and highly qualified team. There is no doubt that the surgeon acts as the leader of that team, and the culture, vision and communication that the surgeon portrays, and models are vital to the outcomes those patients achieve. Consequently, all surgeons should understand the principles of good leadership, and this is the reason why many medical schools and surgical trainee programs now have official leadership courses in their curriculum.\n\nThere are many reasons to become a surgical leader when you have mastered being a competent clinical surgeon, but a many may not realize it gives you an opportunity to continue to develop and learn new skills. Leadership is like most skills, while some people are naturally better than others, everyone can improve by concentrating, learning and developing. Probably the most common reason why people choose to become a surgical leader is to help develop new programs and mentor less experienced faculty. There can be few greater work achievements than watching a novel program come to fruition that you had a hand in helping to foster. Or seeing a colleague develop and go on to have greater individual success. A good surgical leader can have enormous influence on the success of the team and the people within the team. In addition, by developing successful programs a surgical leader can significantly improve the care of patients to a much greater degree than individually treating patients. A good example of this is the formation of a robust quality and safety program. By creating a process that reduces surgical site infections by only 1% you could improve the care of hundreds of patients every year, which is difficult to do in one’s own surgical practice alone.\n\nThe one reason that is unacceptable to want to go into medical leadership is the desire to have a new (more important) title. If this is the reason you are considering surgical leadership you will be unhappy, and the people you are there to serve will be equally unhappy.\n\nWhat value do clinicians have as leaders for a hospital\n\nOften medical leaders undervalue their role in a hospital, perhaps because they have trained for many years to perfect the skills necessary to become a physician but do not appreciate what that brings to hospital management. In fact, many leaders feel intimidated by the new technical terms, abbreviations, and huge spreadsheets that they are presented with. Every profession has its own language and hospital administration is no different, but it is relatively easy to pick up. But even before you have mastered this, clinicians have a vital role to play in running a hospital. Certainly, the most successful hospitals have a strong collaborative relationship between clinical leaders and hospital leaders. After all, both are striving to provide greater and better care to the patients and community they serve. Increasingly, physicians are leading hospitals as their CEO.\n\nClinicians have insight into clinical problems and how to prioritize clinical conditions and treatments. Every hospital would love to provide all the resources necessary for every program, but all too often, difficult choices are necessary and clinicians can guide this. Clinical leaders act as a bridge between providers and administration and are advocates for staff, faculty, and patients to ensure that resources go to the most appropriate place. Importantly, a good clinical leader will have clinical credibility, so that when difficult decisions have to be made, such as which elective surgical patient needs to be cancelled because there are insufficient intensive care beds today, although patients will not be happy it will be based on clinically-relevant criteria.\n\nHow can you become a surgical leader\n\n\n  “The most dangerous leadership myth is that leader are born—that there is a genetic factor to leadership. That’s nonsense; in fact, the opposite is true. Leaders are made rather than born.” —Warren Bennis\n\n\nHaving made the decision to pursue a career as a surgical leader, how can you realize this ambition? There are many ways to go about this. Firstly, and probably most importantly on the job experience is vital. This will mean, even before taking up a position, being involved and actively contributing to committee work. Frequently, physicians will attend a committee because it is “good for your CV” or “will help with promotion” but not actually contribute—responding to emails, being available, answering questions and providing input to the committee. If you have aspirations for leadership, it is important to be active and add value to the committee. By being involved in committee work you will gain insight into the administrative workings of the hospital and hopefully be able to observe good leaders in action and learn from them. Furthermore, you may well have the experience to help solve important problems in the process! What are the attributes that make this person successful and not another?\n\nIn addition to on-the-job experience, there are a few more didactic ways to develop the necessary skills. Most hospitals and Universities will offer a series of leadership courses, and they may cover such areas as successful mentoring, financial education, or human resource work (specifically communication skills). Increasingly, leaders and potential leaders are offered executive coaching, this is normally a one hour a month of one on one conversations with a coach who can help you work through difficult problems and provide guidance. Be warned though a good coach will not tell you what to do but will ask you questions until you have the appropriate approach to deal with the current problem. Finally, there are degree courses, such as an Masters of Business Administration (MBA) or a Masters in Health Care. While these degrees will certainly provide a good education, they are not essential to landing a leadership position. They can certainly indicate a strong desire for leadership. We would reinforce the idea that leadership is a skill that is best improved by practice.\n\nFrequently, people are striving to determine the specific characteristics associated with being a good leader, and in truth there is no one set of characteristics that make a great leader. Effective leaders can be quiet and introverted or eloquent and extroverted. They can be people who enjoy the limelight at presentations, and they can be happy in the shadows. It is important to follow your own character, but be clear and consistent in your communication and actions.\n\nHow to Lead\n\nOnce in a new leadership position, what are the areas that need to be addressed, and how can you best develop and promote your team and prepare the whole team for success? There appear to be several very important aspects to this covered in the following sections.\n\nChanging Culture\n\n\n  “What you do has far greater impact that what you say.” —Stephen Covey\n\n\nOne of the most important first things in a role is to develop the culture of the team. How do you want the team to behave and to present itself? What are the behaviors that need to be promoted and what are the things that should be reduced? There are many aspects to developing a culture: Firstly, it is vital to communicate what you want to achieve, and this should be restated time and time again in almost every communication method that is available. It is not enough though to preach without practicing, but it is more important the leader should personally practice that behavior. For example, if you want the team to be respectful of each other, then the leader needs to treat everyone in the whole team with respect all the time. Creating a good culture takes time, but one or two bad acts by a leader can destroy a good culture in hours. In addition to preaching and practicing the culture, it is necessary to manage and correct behavior that is not in alignment with the culture. If someone, especially a senior person is seen or believed to be “getting away with it” or “above the law,” then all the work to create a good culture will be lost. Once a culture has been created (and this can be very quickly achieved with concerted effort) then it constantly needs attention and management.\n\nOne area that consistently seems to be important but is actually difficult to do is creating a culture that is consistent and, as much as possible, transparent. For example, if there are limited resources available for a set number of planned surgical procedures, deciding how to prioritize said resouces in a manner that is known by everyone (transparency) and applying this in a consistent approach will make the decision making process easier. Even though the people who did not get the resources will be disappointed, they will know why they did not get them and what they have to do to be more successful in the future. This is true for all decisions, if the criteria for success is openly communicated, and the results of the decisions are equally communicated then everyone will know how the system works. Little can be more destructive to a culture than “back room deals” or a feeling that the system is stacked against you or unfair.\n\nCreating the appropriate culture cannot be overstated. There are many examples when a new CEO starts or a new coach leads a team, and within days or weeks, the success and direction of the team has completed changed.\n\nCreating a Vision\n\nFor new surgical leaders having to create a vision seems very intimidating, but it does not need to be. What are you hoping to achieve? Is it to be the best clinical department in the country, to have the safest patient care, to develop a world class research team, or to provide excellent clinical care for your community. Do you want the team to be known as a great place and supportive place to work? What are your priorities? Once you have this in mind then you need to let your team know and keep telling them. It can seem ridiculous to repeat the same things every time you meet or have a staff meeting but everyone needs to know that making sure every patient gets great care every time is still the team’s main priority. Think of a good politician every time they get an interview, on the stump or in front of voters: they say the same thing and stress the same points over and over again, and a good leader needs to do the same thing. The team should never be in any doubt what the vision and goals of the team are.\n\nWhen informing the group about a vision or goals, it is not possible to over communicate. Use every tool you have: meetings, one on ones, texts, emails, and retreats. However frequently you communicate, there will always be at least one person who has not heard or understood what you are hoping to achieve.\n\nOnce you have communicated your vision, this naturally leads to creating goals, both long term and short term. For example, if the vision is to become the best surgical program in the country then it is likely going to take 5–10 years to achieve this. So your long term goals are going to probably include: Developing world class programs, starting a robust quality and safety program, fostering a renowned teaching program, and creating a highly-funded research program. From these long-term goals, short-term goals can be created that can actually be achieved within a year. So that a goal may be to recruit a new surgeon scientist or develop quality dashboards. Having a clear vision, including long-term and short-term goals that the whole team know and have bought into will make your chances of success much greater. By writing down the goals and publicizing them, it has been consistently shown that they are much more likely to be achieved. When you have developed these goals and achieved them, make sure the whole team is aware of those successes!\n\nPeople\n\n\n  “The best executive is the one who has sense enough to pick good people to do what the leader wants done and self-restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it.” —Theodore Roosevelt\n\n\nIn any hospital the most important asset and the most expensive asset are the people who work in it. So once you have the right culture and an appropriate vision concentrating on the people within the team is vital to success. In fact, without recruiting, retaining, and developing the people, a team will never be successful.\n\nRecruitment and retainment\n\nRecruiting the right people is notoriously difficult. Many psychological studies have shown that interviews are a very poor way of assessing how effective the candidate is going to be at their job. Currently, though it is the most widely used method. In order to have the best work force, it is necessary to be able to choose from the most diverse pool, and so having a strong commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is vital today for success. To recruit a diverse workforce, it is important to have a recruitment committee that is diverse and reflects the community that you are serving. That way, individual biases both known and unknown can be minimized, a wider pool of candidates can be obtained and hopefully the best candidate chosen. Larger organizations have systems in place to assist in this process, but if not, then a deliberate and conscientious effort is needed to ensure that the team becomes more diverse, equitable and inclusive.\n\nOnce the right team is in place, keeping them is the next challenge. Team members should be constantly checked in with to make sure that they have the necessary opportunities and resources not only to manage their work but also to achieve their career goals. It is too late when someone comes with another job offer to start giving them new opportunities.\n\nMentorship\n\n\n  “Outstanding leaders go out of their way to boost the self-esteem of their personnel. If people believe in themselves, it’s amazing what they can accomplish.” —Sam Walton\n\n\nAn integral part of being a good leader is mentoring and developing your team. It is necessary to create specific time on a regular basis for this. It can be part of regular meetings or time set aside for mentoring. Mentoring is a difficult skill because it is often easy to slip in to just giving advice, and on occasion that may be necessary but in general mentoring is about carefully listening to your mentee, asking appropriate questions, so that they can think through the problems in their work or career and giving them gentle guidance. Mentoring people can help them develop new skills that are vital for the team. It is also important to push mentees to develop or take on new tasks so that they are always improving and challenging themselves. When appropriate make sure that the mentee is offered new opportunities to pursue that way the team will develop a reputation of creating advancement chances and so will start to attract the best candidates.\n\nAs a leader though it is important to continue to understand the need for guidance in the role. Frequently, leaders are continuing to lean on their own experienced mentors to offer guidance, suggestions and advice in multiple areas. In addition, there is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that surgical coaching has great value in continuing to improve a leader’s skills.\n\nFeedback\n\n\n  “A ruler should be slow to punish and swift to reward.” —Ovid\n\n\nIncreasingly, the importance of feedback is being recognized and requested by the work force. Giving regular positive feedback as close to real time is vital. This will be make it clear what attributes and behavior are wanted in the hospital and will also enable more constructive feedback to be given when necessary. Historically, 3 pieces of positive feedback were given for every one of constructive feedback—the so called feedback sandwich. But more recently this has been increased to up to 9 positive for every constructive. When giving feedback, either positive or constructive, it is better to give very specific examples and to give the feedback as close to the event as possible. So rather than saying you did a great job in the OR today, it may be better to communicate that the trainee was really good at gently handling the tissue. In general it is alright to give positive feedback in front of others (everyone likes being praised) but to give constructive feedback in private. Creating an environment where feedback is expected is vital, as this allows everyone to freely communicate expectations and good results. It allows all the team members to improve. In top performing companies, feedback is being given both to team members and leaders. Giving and receiving good feedback tends to be easy but giving constructive feedback is more difficult and needs to be deliberate, thought through, and timely.\n\nDifficult conversations\n\n\n  “The growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership.” —Harvey Firestone\n\n\nOn occasion it is necessary to have difficult or crucial conversations with team members especially if their behavior or work is not reaching expectations. No one likes having these conversations, but they are vital for people and for teams to improve. There is a tendency to put them off and find a “better” time, but they will always be difficult so it is best to get them done as soon as the need is understood. It is obviously best to have these in private and to ask the person about the event in question and what, in their words, happened and what they thought of it. Many times the person will realize their error and apologize without you needing to say anything except to work on a way to help the person so that it does not happen again. On occasion and more concerning the person may deny or gloss over the error, this requires more education and input from the leader. Many organizations now have specific offices that can help people improve their behavioral problems and sometimes the person has medical or social problems that we need to address first. If the team perceives that inappropriate behavior is not being addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, it may be taken that this behavior is accepted. Consequently, it is best to have these difficult conversations as quickly as possible assuming all the necessary information has been obtained first.\n\nOpportunities\n\nGiving team members opportunities within the team or organization is vital. This may seem like straight delegation but by offering people these opportunities either small (e.g., to arrange a meeting or retreat) or large (e.g., to develop a whole new program) sends a clear signal that you trust in them and believe they have the skills to do the job correctly. This has many advantages. It allows them to develop and to have confidence in their own ability, but it also allows you to move on to other projects that may be only you have the insight or information to successfully complete. By delegating appropriately team moral and confidence is greatly improved the team develop new skills and the leader greatly multiplies the work that can be achieved.\n\nMoney\n\nMoney can ruin everything! If people feel that others are better and unfairly compensated or that resources are not being fairly divided then this quickly leads to team disharmony. Wherever possible having a transparent system in place will allow people to know why decisions or compensation are different and what is necessary to improve the chances of better compensation. Where the system is opaque or murky people tend to assume that something underhand or unfair is happening even if it is not. In general, there are fewer complaints if people know and understand even if they are getting less money than others. Starting to develop transparency can be difficult though, as money is a difficult topic to bring up.\n\nContinuous monitoring and reevaluating\n\nTo understand how the team is performing and whether you are achieving the goals the team have decided upon, it is critical to have prospective measurements. When you set a goal (for example, increasing research output), have metrics clearly defined before you start and measure them regularly. Publish them so everyone in the team knows if you are achieving those goals. Interestingly, team dynamics and the desire to improve can often significantly improve the data even without putting any new mechanisms in place. For example, just by documenting and publicizing what individual surgeons on time start rate is you will see an improvement as no one wants to be “below average.” Once you have these metrics in place, creating a dashboard and regularly reviewing the data will continue to lead to improvements. Also, by regularly reviewing the data you will be able to decide when it is time to move on and concentrate on something else.\n\nTime\n\nFinally, being a good administrator and leader takes time, it is not possible to continue having the same busy clinical practice and then taking on leading the whole team. You will need time to think, develop visions and goals, to meet regular with your direct reports, have time to mentor people. In addition, there will be many meetings with hospital leadership that it is vital to attend, so you are able to understand how the hospital works and what the current climate of the hospital. This will allow you to appropriately advocate for your team.\n\nIf you do not feel able or want to give up some of your practice, seriously consider if this is the right time to take on this position. If your organization is not prepared to compensate you appropriately for your time, once again consider if this is worth doing. Taking on a leadership role is incredibly rewarding: seeing new programs develop and team members taking on new opportunities is exciting and fulfilling, but if you are going to be annoyed by the lack of time or compensation it may not be the right time.\n\nHowever, if you are given the right opportunities and resources, the satisfaction you gain from your new role can easily compensate for the reduction in your clinical work.\n\n\n  “There are three essentials to leadership: humility, clarity and courage.” —Fuchan Yuan\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Becoming a surgical leader provides new opportunities for learning about healthcare systems and to influence the care of a larger number of patients.\n  Start by getting involved in committee work and actively participating.\n  Leadership skills are best obtained through purposeful practice.\n  Creating a culture, defining your vision, and cultivating people and talent are key to a leader’s success.\n  Be purposeful, transparent, and available.\n\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n  Admiral McRaven addresses the University of Texas at Austin Class of 2014 \n  The power of vulnerability | Brené Brown | TEDxHouston\n\n\nRecommended Readings\n\n\nDethmer J, Chapman D, Klemp KW.

        "title": "Social Media and Learning Opportunities",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThe use of social media has progressed considerably over the past decade, with approximately 3.484 billion people worldwide engaging in at least one application in 2019.1,2 The use of social media applications such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok has become an integral part of people’s lives, with many users dedicating several hours of their day to these various platforms.1 According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), social media usage in the United States increased from approximately 27% to 86% between 2009 and 2019, reflecting a 59% increase in a ten year period.2 This rise has been particularly prominent in the younger adult population, 90% of whom with internet access are social media users.3 YouTube is the most commonly utilised platform, with approximately 73% of U.S adults reporting use.4 This is closely followed by Facebook (69%), Instagram (37%), Pinterest (28%), LinkedIn (27%), Snapchat (24%) and Twitter (22%). Individual social media platforms, their characteristics and potential uses in pediatric urology are outlined in Table 1. With an increased uptake of social media by young adults, the potential exists to deliver high quality health information and interventions to a cohort that may be hard-to-reach with conventional health promotion and disease prevention measures.3\n\nTable 1 Social media platforms, their characteristics and potential uses in pediatric urology**\n\n\n  \n    \n      Social Media Platform\n      Characteristics\n      Potential uses in pediatric urology\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Twitter\n      Quick, frequent messages with a 140 character limit, ‘Tweets’ may contain photos, videos, links or text\n      Quick educational points on pediatric urology topics. Links to reliable sources of information\n    \n    \n      Facebook\n      Sharing of text, images, videos or links to ‘followers’. No limit on characters.\n      Patient awareness campaigns, short educational videos\n    \n    \n      YouTube\n      Video-sharing platform (no limit on length)\n      Educational videos (academic and patient-friendly)\n    \n    \n      Instagram\n      Photo and short video sharing application\n      Short educational videos or photographs\n    \n    \n      TikTok\n      Short videos (maximum 60 seconds)\n      Short educational videos\n    \n  \n\n\nSince its inception, users have become increasingly reliant on social media for health information.5 Given their unique relationship with social media, many young adults resort to social media applications as their primary source of healthcare information, an issue which has only been amplified by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.6 While social media has become a powerful tool for patients to obtain information about medical conditions, share their own experiences and even communicate with healthcare professionals, there lies a great potential for the spread of misinformation.7,8 These applications allow pseudo-experts and influencers, often lacking any expertise on the topic, to create content and spread false information that has the potential to reach millions of users worldwide.9 While this ability has the potential to be used to the advantage of the healthcare professional by delivering reliable, accessible information to the public, it unfortunately catalyses the dissemination of misinformation when in the wrong hands.10 Despite the risks social media poses to the public from a healthcare perspective, the potential benefits are undeniable.\n\nConventional methods of healthcare communication, via the use of pamphlets or newsletters for example, are rapidly becoming obsolete.7 The incorporation of social media by hospitals has been shown to significantly increase patient use of hospital services, as well as having a positive impact on its public perception.11 Healthcare professionals now have the ability to share information, promote good health behaviours and engage with the public via the use of social media applications, providing much-needed accessible healthcare information to vast amounts of users.12,13 The distribution of credible information via these applications has already proved to result in observable behavioural changes, with research demonstrating a positive effect on weight loss, smoking cessation and physical activity in exposed patients.12,14 Recognising that many healthcare professionals have incorporated social media applications into their methods of communication with patients, several government bodies have developed and published guidelines on how to utilise these platforms correctly, efficiently and safely.15\n\nThe field of urology is one of the pioneering specialties to harness the opportunities provided by social media for the education and global exchange of information pertaining to urological disorders.16 While urology residents worldwide are optimistic about the potential social media holds for education, an element of doubt exists surrounding its correct and appropriate usage within a healthcare setting.16,17,18 Several guidelines have been developed to shed light on this confusion, and provide healthcare professionals with clear and safe recommendations to engage with social media responsibly.19\n\nIn 2014, the British Society of Urology International (BJUI) proposed ten recommendations for healthcare professionals to engage responsibly in social media.19 These recommendations were as follows:\n\n\n  Always consider that your content will exist forever and be available to everyone.\n  If you are posting as a doctor, you should identify yourself.\n  State that your views are your own if your institutions are identifiable.\n  Your digital profile and behaviour online must align with the standards of your profession.\n  Avoid impropriety—always disclose potential conflicts of interest.\n  Maintain a professional boundary between you and your patient.\n  Do not post content in anger and always be respectful.\n  Protect patient privacy and confidentiality at all times.\n  Alert colleagues if you feel they have posted content which may be deemed inappropriate for a doctor.\n  Always be truthful and strive for accuracy.\n\n\nThe European Association of Urology (EAU) soon followed suit, publishing guidelines initially in 2014 and updating them in 2018.18 Similarly to BJUI, the EAU devised ten practical guidelines on the appropriate use of social media. These guidelines were as follows:\n\n\n  Understand how other users behave online before interacting on social networks.\n  Establish and maintain a professional digital identity that is in line with your professional practice and goals.\n  Never undermine your patients’ privacy or confidentiality.\n  Avoid providing medical advice and maintain limits between yourself and patients.\n  Assume that anything and everything you post is permanent.\n  Use instant messaging services with care.\n  Exercise professionalism.\n  Beware of social media policies set by employers.\n  Beware of how advertisement and self-promotion will be perceive by others.\n  Use disease-specific ontology hashtags for structured online communication.\n\n\nOf note, the EAU Guidelines Office (GO) Dissemination Committee (DC) has recently published its strategy to improve the visibility and dissemination of EAU guidelines in order to successfully implement them worldwide.20 The DC has been able to adapt to and engage with a wide range of audience using Twitter, Facebook and more recently Instagram as a medium, thus maximising its reach. The EAU GO is also in the process of developing podcasts, which will involve panel members presenting guideline recommendations and encouraging debate in a question-answer format.21 This will undoubtedly be an invaluable tool for busy clinicians, who will soon be able to listen to new recommendations on the go.\n\nFinally, the American Urological Association (AUA) published a document with seven ‘best practices’, designed to provide guidance and advice to effectively utilise social media within urology.22 The guidelines were as follows:\n\n\n  Be professional\n  Protect confidentiality\n  Allow for interaction\n  Be courteous\n  Exercise discretion\n  Support AUA’s identity\n  Be thoughtful\n\n\nWhile social media continues to be an exciting, novel area of digital communication for clinicians, risks do exist and it is imperative that we understand the boundaries of professionalism to avoid problems. Adhering to guidelines, such as those described above, will undoubtedly assist healthcare professionals posting content on these platforms and avert any risk of disciplinary action for misconduct.19\n\nTwitter, a social networking platform with 330 million users launched in 2006, allows users to post messages up to 280 characters known as ‘tweets’.18 Its use in medicine involves research, online journal clubs, online support for patients and discussions about clinical care.23,24,25 The use of Twitter in the field of urology is well documented.18 Wilkinson et al analysed the use of the application at a variety of urological conferences to enhance the social media experience.26 They found that over the course of eight separate urology conferences in 2013, 12,363 tweets were sent generating a total of over 14 million impressions. Almost ten years on, these numbers have undoubtedly multiplied, exponentially increasing global reach and international engagement. Similarly, many urological academic journals have taken to Twitter to promote and highlight significant journal articles to readers.27,28 Cardona-Grau et al aimed to evaluate the reach and academic influence these journals have in the realm of social media, by developing the Twitter impact factor (TIF).27 This tool incorporates the number of followers, tweets and retweets an individual journal has, to provide a score that serves as an alternative to the conventional journal impact factor (JIF). Thangasamy et al described their twelve month experience from the International Urology Journal Club, the first international journal club to be carried out on Twitter.29 The club involved the monthly discussion of a recently published article, drawing in 189 unique users from nineteen countries across six continents. The authors concluded that the use of social media in this context was a viable and sustainable alternative, allowing urology trainees and specialists from multiple centres worldwide the opportunity to come together and discuss papers of interest.\n\nFacebook, a social media site launched in 2007, has been utilised in medicine and specifically the field of urology for many reasons, including the establishment of physician group networks, recruitment for clinical trials and dissemination of information for patient awareness campaigns.18 Borgmann et al performed a feasibility study to assess the efficacy of a professional campaign on cryptorchidism using Facebook advertisements.30 With an investment of €7,500, the campaign generated 2,511,923 impressions, 7,369 homepage sessions and 1,086 brochure downloads, demonstrating that social media sites such as Facebook are an effective platform for campaigns such as the above. Despite the potential Facebook offers to the field of urology, the platform has also been used to expose potentially unprofessional personal behaviour to the public.30 Koo et al analysed the Facebook accounts of 281 US urology residency graduates for unprofessional content.30 72% of graduates had publicly identifiable profiles and 13% had profiles containing explicitly unprofessional behaviour, including intoxication, uncensored profanity, unlawful behaviour or displaying confidential patient information. It is evident that a greater awareness of our online identities is essential, to avoid implications for education and professionalism competencies.\n\nYouTube is well established in the field of urology for patient and physician education via the creation and publication of videos.18 In 2017, Siegel et al measured the usage rate of various social media resources within the prostate cancer (PCa) community and found 536 videos accounting for 43,866,634 views, 52,655 likes and 12,393 comments.31 These videos were primarily educational and supportive in nature, but also included personal experiences of patients with the disease. Screening, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and robotic-assisted prostatectomy were among the topics discussed. The authors demonstrated that the utilisation of social media within the PCa community is high and that YouTube in particular was engaged with more than its counterparts (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram). Borgmann et al used YouTube to quantify public and academic interest in urology, hypothesising that a discrepancy would exist between public and academic interest for various urologic diseases and treatments.32 Their results demonstrated a high public interest in premature ejaculation, testicular cancer and erectile dysfunction, whereas the topic with the highest academic interest was prostate cancer, confirming their hypothesis which undoubtedly has implications for future research strategies, conference planning and patient information projects. With the spread of misinformation on the rise, Loeb et al aimed to characterise the quality of educational bladder cancer posts on the video-sharing platform.33 The authors reviewed the first 150 videos on ‘bladder cancer’ and assessed each one for elements of misinformation, revealing moderate to high levels in 21% of videos assessed. Using the validated DISCERN instrument, 67% of videos were shown to contain moderate to poor quality of information, with a high commercial bias exhibited in 17%. This study demonstrated that while there are several educational videos on bladder cancer of good quality, much of the content surrounding this topic on YouTube is of poor quality and presents a risk of exposure to misinformation. Selvi et al suggested several methods of overcoming this risk, including the provision of thorough, high quality information to patients at the time of diagnosis, as well as the recommendation by healthcare professionals of YouTube channels run by international or national health organisations such as the European Association of Urology (EAU).34\n\nInstagram, a photo and video sharing application launched in 2010, is no exception to the dissemination of misinformation.35 Xu et al searched for posts using the hashtag #prostatecancer in 2020, examining a combination of video and image posts and assessing their quality using validated tools.35 While the presence of educational content on prostate cancer on Instagram had previously been established, the quality of information being shared had yet to be characterised.31 The study demonstrated that 90% of content examined was of low to moderate quality (DISCERN rating &lt;4) and 40% contained moderate to high levels of misinformation. This is the first study assessing the quality of content surrounding a urological disorder, and highlights the importance of proceeding with caution when searching social media platforms like Instagram for health information.\n\nTikTok is a social media application that allows its 1.1 billion users to create short videos that have the potential to reach millions of users worldwide.36 Whilst the majority of these videos are solely entertainment based, the platform is being increasingly utilised as a way to search for or provide medical information.37 TikTok has been shown to have a farther and more diverse reach than its follower-based counterparts such as Instagram or Twitter, allowing for the vast dissemination of information to users of all age groups and backgrounds.38 With up to 96% of parents admitting to using social media for health education, it is imperative to assess the quality of content being published on these applications to ensure the safety of patients.39 O’Sullivan et al assessed the authenticity of information on various common paediatric conditions by comparing video content with guidelines provided by the EAU.10 Conditions assessed included nocturnal enuresis, vesicoureteral reflux, hypospadias and testicular torsion. The authors found factual EAU-backed information in only 22.2% of videos analysed, with several videos advising therapies that could prove harmful to the user. This study demonstrated the potential for TikTok to be utilised as a resource for health information, however further regulatory measures are necessary to prevent the spread of misinformation to patients.\n\nKey Points\n\n\n  Many young adults resort to social media applications as their primary source of healthcare information.\n  Healthcare professionals now have the ability to share information, promote good health behaviours and engage with the public via the use of social media applications, providing much-needed accessible healthcare information to vast amounts of users.\n  The field of urology is one of the pioneering specialties to harness the opportunities provided by social media for the education and global exchange of information pertaining to urological disorders\n  Various guidelines, such as those described by the BJUI and EAU, have been developed to help healthcare professionals engage with social media responsibly and present themselves professionally while doing so.\n  The increased uptake of social media education by healthcare professionals within the field of urology, in combination with the introduction of regulatory measures to prevent misinformation, will allow for the production of evidence-based content to educate patients about their conditions and potential treatment options.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nSocial media use has exponentially increased over the last decade, with many healthcare professionals now utilising the platforms for research purposes, online journal clubs, discussions about patient care and for providing the public with accessible, high quality information about their conditions and management options.1,2,23 Various guidelines, such as those described by the BJUI and EAU, have been developed to help healthcare professionals engage with social media responsibly and present themselves professionally while doing so.18,19,22 The use of social media platforms is well described within the field of urology, however there is evidently work to be done to improve content and combat the spread of misinformation.10 The increased uptake of social media education by healthcare professionals within the field of urology, in combination with the introduction of regulatory measures to prevent misinformation, will allow for the production of evidence-based content to educate patients about their conditions and potential treatment options.\n\nReferences\n\n\nKarim F, Oyewande A, Abdalla LF, Chaudhry Ehsanullah R, Khan S.

        "title": "Use of Patient-Reported Outcomes",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nIn medical practice, patient-self reports of their experience related to a specific disease or a treatment for a given condition may significantly differ from those of caregivers or practitioners. Patient-reported outcomes are a formal mechanism by which practitioners are able to collect data about a patient’s experience and gain valuable insight into ways to improve patient experience and the approach to care. These data allow patients and providers to come together in a shared decision-making process to improve the quality of care, treatment approaches, and interventions.\n\nHowever, what constitutes a meaningful patient-reported may be a subject of debate. Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs), as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration are “any report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else.”1 PROs may be used to measure the effect of a given intervention (medical or behavioral) on a specific concept, such as:\n\n\n  A specific symptom or group of symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pain, depression), or\n  A type of bodily or neuropsychological function or group of such functions.1\n\n\nOne specific type of patient-reported outcome is Quality of Life (QoL). According to the WHO, QoL is a multi-faceted construct that measures the composite of all positive and negative aspects of life.2 Health, in turn, was first described by the WHO Constitution in 1948 as the “state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”3 Health-related QoL (HRQoL) focuses on QoL and health in the context of any existing disease or ongoing treatment.4,5 Generic measures focus on QoL or HRQoL as a whole, while disease-specific measures contextualize HRQoL concerns within the confines of a specific disease (Table 1). When a measure focuses on one component of QoL, e.g. social functioning, this is called a dimensional assessment.5 Functioning involves assessment of task performance in the context of social, physical, or behavioral/psychological activities.6 Measures used in pediatric urology have encompassed one or all of these concepts (Figure 1).7\n\nTable 1 Examples of HRQoL and Disease-Specific HRQoL for Social Health\n* The SF-36, or 36-item Short Form Survey, is a set of generic and easily administered QoL measures. \n** The QUALAS, or QUality of Life Assessment in Spina Bifida, is a disease-specific measure of QoL in the setting of Spina Bifida.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Generic (SF-36) *\n      Disease-Specific (Spina Bifida, QUALAS) **\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      To what extent have your health or emotional problems interfered with normal social activities?8\n      To what extent do urine problems stop you from doing fun things?9\n    \n  \n\n\n \nFigure 1 Types of Measures and Relationships. Adapted from Raveendran, et al. 2021.7\n\nMeasure validation is a rigorous process by which a patient-reported outcome can be ascertained to be clinically meaningful, relevant, and assured to accurately represent the patient’s experiences.10 The validation criteria established by the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) are considered the gold-standard approach to measure validation, and include several detailed steps. These steps are confirmation of the conceptual and measurement model, reliability, validity, interpretability, respondent burden, alternative forms for administration, and multi-cultural or multi-lingual adaptations (Table 2).10 Studies using non-valid, or informal, measures to obtain PROs are still valuable, as the amalgamation of responses from such studies can assist with designing a conceptual model and then a measure for HRQoL in specific disease states.11 Pediatric urologists should therefore know how to evaluate a measure’s validity prior to use. In fact, some published measures have not passed rigorous validation techniques, and have been recommended for further revision prior to clinical administration.12\n\nTable 2 SAC criteria.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Criterion\n      Definitions/Examples\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Conceptual Model\n      A justification and detailed description of what is being measured and why. This often involves a systematic literature review to create the conceptual model. Qualitative interviews are then used to obtain patient input to revise/refine the model. The model is then used to guide the design of the measure.\n    \n    \n      Reliability\n      Tests that ensure that the measure performs consistently and is free from random error. Some examples include test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability.\n    \n    \n      Validity\n      The tests that confirm a measure accurately measures what it is intended to measure. Using the example above, validation of the QUALAS-T for Spina Bifida may require the comparison of patient scores for continence questions to those of the validated Pediatric Incontinence Questionnaire and the social functioning questions to the validated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, etc. (Convergent validity)\n    \n    \n      Interpretability\n      Establishes whether the response range and scale are clinically meaningful. For example, if patients consistently respond Always (ceiling value) or Never (floor value) to a specific question, the question may not yield a meaningful scaled result, and needs to be altered.\n    \n    \n      Respondent Burden\n      The amount of time and number of questions required for the patient to complete the measure and for a provider to administer the measure.\n    \n    \n      Alternative Forms\n      The availability of several versions of the form for ease of administration.\n    \n    \n      Cultural/Multilingual Adaptations\n      The availability of culturally modified and translated forms to increase the generalizability of the measure.\n    \n  \n\n\nSelecting the Appropriate PRO in Pediatric Urology\n\nFactors to Consider When Creating or Using a PRO in Pediatric Urology\n\nFor Which Population is the Measure Intended\n\nThe key question when examining a measure is whether the measure is designed for the pediatric population at large (e.g., a generic measure) or for patients with a specific disease process (e.g., spina bifida)? If a generic measure is used in a rare disease process, it must be with the understanding that the measure may not be sensitive enough to detect a difference in PROs or HRQoL. One such example is the Incontinence Symptom Index Pediatric (ISIP) form, which was first validated in bladder dysfunction, then in the more specific neurogenic bladder population, prior to its use in a spina bifida study.13,14\n\nWho is the Intended Respondent\n\nThe age, developmental stage, and cognitive ability of the respondents are key factors when selecting an appropriate measure. Validated measures must usually be adapted for these considerations. For instance, the Incontinence Symptom Index, a measure that had been validated in adult women to assess symptom bother in either stress or urge incontinence, has been adapted and validated in the pediatric population for 11–17 year olds.13 In the process of developing the ISI-pediatric form, the authors added two domains more relevant to the pediatric population, nocturnal enuresis and insensate wetting symptoms and dropped an item that was irrelevant. Specific types of reports include:\n\n\n  Youth Self Reports, which are the youth responding to a direct question about their experience. For example, a youth questionnaire for spina bifida asks, “To what extent do urine problems stop you from doing fun things?”9\n  Caregiver Proxy Reports are forms designed to assess PROs in young children or the cognitively impaired, and are designed to be completed by the caregiver of the subject in question. In these reports, the caregiver reports on the subject’s outcomes based upon feedback from or observations of the subject. For instance, a proxy report in spina bifida might ask, “How, if at all, has your child’s social life been affected by continence-related concerns?”\n  Parent or Caregiver Reports are designed to assess the caregiver’s personal experiences and condition or day-to-day life. For example, a parent/caregiver report in spina bifida might ask, “How much, if at all, have the patient’s continence-related concerns affected your [the parent/caregiver’s] social life?”\n\n\nWhat are the Domains Being Measured\n\nWhen developing a conceptual model, the model often contains multiple themes or facets. These themes can also be termed “domains.” For instance, the QUALAS-Teen (QUALAS-T) measure’s conceptual model includes Family and Independence and Bladder and Bowel function as the two major thematic domains.9 These domains were rigorously identified using expert consensus, detailed literature review, and patient interviews. Knowing the conceptual model and domains within can help investigators target specific areas/domains of HRQoL or create a more comprehensive measure of HRQoL.\n\nKey Points: Selecting a Patient-Reported Outcome\n\n\n  When choosing a measure for a study, pediatric urologists should take note of the following for each measure they select to ensure that findings are valid, reliable, and clinically meaningful:\n    \n      the target population\n      intended respondents\n      conceptual model/domains\n    \n  \n\n\nPotential Applications of PROs in Pediatric Urology\n\nPROs are a powerful tool in the arsenal of any pediatric urologist, and their potential applications in clinical practice are vast and depend on their purpose, i.e., QoL, treatment outcome, indications for surgical intervention, or any other disease-related outcome.\n\nThe application of QoL instruments in urology in particular has been highly variable. A recent integrative literature review of QoL instrument use in pediatric urology identified a total of 43 studies examining QoL in pediatric urology.7 Nine of these studies were focused on functioning, while the remainder examined some combination of QoL, HRQoL, disease-specific HRQoL, and functioning. Some specific examples of applications in pediatric urology include the following:\n\nAs a Primary Treatment Outcome in Clinical Trials\n\nIn a non-inferiority study in the voiding dysfunction population, the validated Vancouver Non-Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction/Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome Questionnaire was used to measure QoL outcomes in a randomized clinical trial comparing outcomes after a bladder training video versus standard urotherapy.15 The bladder training video was not inferior to standard urotherapy in QoL score improvements.\n\nTo Determine Indications for Operation or Re-Operation\n\nIn a cohort of 25 women with bladder exstrophy and pelvic organ prolapse, the authors demonstrated improvements in both continence and sexual function PROs after correction of pelvic organ prolapse.16\n\nTo Obtain Information About the Natural History of an Illness\n\nOne group validated a parent, parent-proxy, and child measure to characterize the experiences of children and parents of children with differences of sexual differentiation (DSD), and characterized parental stress related to diagnosis, surgery, and decisional regret.17\n\nTo Identify Patient Priorities\n\nOne study tried to identify how patient preferences could dictate the surgical approach to kidney or pelvic surgery, using an informal crowdsourcing survey, and found that patients preferred a Pfannenstiel incision for pelvic surgery and a dorsal lumbotomy incision for kidney surgery to well-hidden abdominal port sites for robotic surgery.18\n\nTo Assess Long-Term Psychosocial Outcomes Related to Genitourinary\nAnomalies or Reconstruction\n\nUsing generic, valid measures for anxiety and depression, one group found that male caregivers of children with life-threatening conditions and ambiguous genitalia were more likely to exhibit symptoms of anxiety and require additional support when compared to female caregivers.19 The authors concluded that male caregivers may require active support earlier after diagnosis.\n\nCurrent Measures in Pediatric Urology\n\nInformal measures have been used in pediatric urology to assess outcomes after urologic procedures. Two such examples include an informal survey was administered to the families of patients whose children had undergone meatotomy.20 The survey focused on age, pain control, and urinary tract symptoms, and identified that 79% of families reported major improvements after the procedure. Another informal survey found that adult patients who had undergone pediatric procedures preferred Pfannenstiel incisions for pelvic surgery and dorsal lumbotomy for kidney surgery to minimally invasive abdominal port sites.18 Many valid measures have been produced to assess disease-specific patient experiences in the areas of bowel and bladder dysfunction, hypospadias, spina bifida, vesicoureteral reflux, transplant, and DSD. Summaries of existing measures are available in Table 3.\n\nTable 3 Valid, Disease-Specific Measures in Pediatric Urology. * Meets SAC criteria for rigorous psychometric validation, see Table 2.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Condition\n      Measure\n      Items\n      Details\n      Age of Intended Respondents\n      Validation Data\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Bowel and Bladder Dysfunction\n      DVSS\n      10\n      Domains not delineated, includes bladder and bowel questions\n      3-10 y/o, 1 question for parent\n      Farhat, et al. 200021\n    \n    \n      Bowel and Bladder Dysfunction\n      DVISS\n      13\n      Domains not delineated, includes bladder and bowel questions;

Widely used and valid measures include the following (Table 3).\n\nDysfunctional Voiding Scoring System\n\nThis measure was the first measure of its kind, and was designed to quantitatively measure bowel and bladder symptoms from a validated patient report.43 Of note, one of the authors of this chapter developed this measure. Questions were initially adapted from the International Reflux Study in children, and underwent modifications in subsequent studies.21,22 The instrument underwent a name change in an effort to use standardized International Children’s Continence Society (ICCS) terminology.44 This measure contains 10 items focused on effects of incontinence, bowel movements, urgency, straining, dysuria, and a parent-proxy report of child’s stress level related to the voiding symptoms.21 As a result of its rigorous validation and minimal response burden, this measure has been used in numerous studies, and has even been validated and culturally adapted for Serbian, Thai, Japanese, Brazilian, Korean, and Iranian populations.45,46,47,48,49,50\n\nPediatric Incontinence Questionnaire\n\nThis is a robust, 20-question measure with questions focused on the effects of incontinence on QoL.23,24 It is also the only pediatric BBD measure that directly assesses effects of incontinence on QoL. The authors identified several relevant domains in their conceptual model, including social interactions, self-esteem, family and home, body image, independence, mental health and treatment effects. The measure has also been culturally adapted and translated for Chinese-speaking, Swedish, and Dutch-speaking populations.24,25\n\nVancouver Symptom Score\n\nThis is a 14-item measure that includes assessments of bother related to voiding and storage symptoms, as well as constipation. The measure was validated in a population of 4–16-year-old children (males and females) and has since been translated and adapted to a Dutch population.26,51\n\nIncontinence-Symptom Index-Pediatric\n\nThis measure was adapted from an adult measure to assess symptom bother in either stress or urge incontinence in women. The authors focused on adaptation and validation in the pediatric population for 11-17 year olds, using rigorous psychometric validation techniques.13 As previously mentioned, the authors also revised the conceptual model for incontinence in this population, and identified that nocturnal enuresis and insensate wetting symptoms were of unique importance to the pediatric population. Another group successfully confirmed the reliability and validity of the ISI-P for patients with spina bifida and neurogenic incontinence.14\n\nIowa Bowel and Bladder Dysfunction Questionnaire\n\nThis measure underwent a rigorous development and validation process that closely assimilated the SAC criteria.28 Further, the authors compared the discriminant validity, or similarity of overall scaled responses of this measure to the VSS described above. The authors developed a subclassification within their instrument that would more reliability characterize the type of BBD experienced by the patients based upon their responses. Questions assessed the presence and absence of symptoms, as well as symptom bother. The result was an 18-item questionnaire that was validated in 3–19-year-olds. Parent-proxy reports were used for 3–8-year-olds, and self-reports were used for patients aged 9 and above.\n\nQuestionnaire for Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome\n\nOther existing measures requiring further validation include the Questionnaire for Dysfunctional Elimination Syndrome (QDES) 15-item measure that includes both a patient self-report and a parent-proxy report.27 Measure items focus on bowel and bladder symptoms, psychological stress assessments, infectious symptoms, and family history assessments. In addition, two adaptations of the DVSS, the Dysfunctional voiding and incontinence scoring system (DVISS), and its shortened version, the Concise Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Symptom Scale were developed but failed tests of reliability.22,52\n\nKey Points: PROs in Bowel and Bladder Dysfunction\n\n\n  8 validated measures exist.\n  Each measure has different strengths.\n  Some measures, like the ISIP, focus exclusively on urinary symptoms, while others incorporate bowel symptoms and psychological symptoms.\n  The DVSS, PIN-Q, ISIP, and Iowa form have the most robust validation data.\n  The PIN-Q form incorporates QoL assessments.\n\n\nHypospadias\n\nPROs in hypospadias have been extensively explored for a myriad of purposes, including comparison of surgeon and patient priorities in cosmesis, effects of surgical technique, studying the varying effects of disease complexity on psychosocial health, and assessment of urinary symptoms.31,30,53,54,29,55 The authors of this chapter proposed a conceptual model for hypospadias-specific HRQoL was proposed based upon thematic coding of existing literature, and includes domains of penile appearance, voiding function, social function, psychological health, and sexual health.11 When looking at existing PROs in hypospadias, many measures have been used to explore penile appearance, voiding function and sexual health, but no single measure comprehensively explores all proposed domains.56 Existing measures in hypospadias have made important strides in determining patient priorities related to hypospadias surgery. Based upon our previous rigorous assessment of validation, the highest-quality measures in hypospadias include the following:\n\nGenital Perception Scale\n\nThe Genital Perception Scale (GPS) was the first PRO to be developed in the hypospadias population.54,29 The measure reviewed glans anatomy, penile girth, flaccid penile length, and appearance of the scrotum and testes. It was validated in two forms, a pediatric form and an adult form, and demonstrated that proximal hypospadias patients tended to have a lower GPS score. A Body Perception Score (BPS) to understand patients’ body image was also developed with the GPS but did not meet validity criteria. To date, this measure has not been used for additional clinical studies.\n\nPediatric Penile Perception Scale/Penile Perception Scale\n\nPediatric Penile Perception Scale/Penile Perception Scale (PPPS/PPS) was dedicated to obtaining the patient’s opinion on post-operative appearance.31,30 This measure focuses solely on aspects of penile appearance, including general appearance, meatal position, glans anatomy, and shaft skin. It has been used in several other studies as a measure of technical outcomes after hypospadias repair.10,57 The pediatric form was written for 6–17-year-old males, while the adult form was adapted for older patients.\n\nHypospadias Objective Score System\n\nHypospadias Objective Score System (HOSE) was a 5-point measure designed to compare parent-proxy PROs focused on penile appearance to estimations of surgeons and RNs.32 In addition to an assessment of penile appearance, the authors included a question on voiding function to increase utility. Its minimal response burden and wide applicability have led to its use in multiple studies of surgical technique.58,59\n\nBody-Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults\n\nThe Body-Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults (BESAA) measures how patients feel about their own appearance and how patients believe others perceive their appearance.60 This scale was shown to be both reliable and valid in adolescents and adults with hypospadias.33\n\nMini-International Prostate Symptom Score\n\nMeasures requiring further validation include the mini-International Prostate Symptom Score (mini-IPSS), which was designed to assess penile appearance, voiding function, and parental worry.55 The measure was translated into English and Spanish and has been used in multiple studies reviewing postoperative preferences, but validation studies are pending.61,62,63\n\nPsychological Well-Being Index\n\nPsychological Well-Being Index (PGWBI) is a generic valid scale that measures domains pertinent to anxiety, depression, health, well-being, vitality, and self-control.33 One group demonstrated that this measure was a reliable measure of psychological well-being in hypospadias patients but did not meet other criteria for validity and interpretability.\n\nSatisfaction in Genital Hypospadias Treatment\n\nThe Satisfaction in Genital Hypospadias Treatment (SIGHT) is a German questionnaire designed to assess psychosexual development in adolescents who had previously undergone hypospadias surgery, and was shown to be valid.34 However, its use in research has been limited due to the absence of additional cultural and linguistic adaptations. In addition, generic measures of QoL and function have been used to evaluate the associations between penile appearance and overall HRQoL, social functioning, and psychological or sexual functioning.64,65,66 However, a narrative review performed by the authors of this chapter has demonstrated that generic measures often yield conflicting results, further supporting the need for a comprehensive, disease-specific assessment of HRQoL in hypospadias.11\n\nKey Points: PROs in Hypospadias\n\n\n  7 valid measures exist.\n  Most measures focus on aspects of penile appearance, while two include assessments of voiding function, and 2 others include psychological function.\n  One measure reviews sexual function.\n\n\nVesicoureteral Reflux\n\nValid measures in Vesicoureteral reflux have focused on pre and post-operative experiences, and include assessments of physical function, psychological well-being, school activity function, disease-related symptoms and satisfaction with care.35 Valid measures in transplant focus on general fatigue, facets of kidney disease, treatment problems, family and peer interactions, worry, physical appearance, communication, and psychosocial risk factors.36,67,37\n\nSpina Bifida\n\nValid measures of QoL in Spina Bifida have investigated by pediatricians, rehabilitation medicine specialists, and pediatric urologists.9 The measures produced by urologists have a specific focus on understanding the effects of urinary and bowel function,9,38,39 while measures produced by non-urologists, such as the HRQoL-SB, often must be used in conjunction with continence measures to understand the effects of continence on QoL.68 Valid measures in BBD have also been used as treatment outcome measures in neurogenic incontinence.14,69\n\nQuality of Life Assessment in Spina Bifida\n\nThe QUAlity of Life Assessment in Spina Bifida (QUALAS) was designed to be a concise, comprehensive measure of disease-specific HRQoL that incorporated an assessment of bowel and bladder function.9,38,39 Its conceptual model was rigorously developed with extensive stakeholder input, and tests of reliability and convergent and discriminant validity yielded excellent results. An additional benefit is that is has been adapted for childhood, teenaged, and adult populations.9,38 This adaptation will allow for longitudinal studies of HRQoL in spina bifida patients. The battery of QUALAS measures (Child, Teenager, and Adult) has been adapted for a Brazilian70 and Japanese-speaking population.71,72\n\nKey Points: PROs in Spina Bifida\n\n\n  2 valid measures exist.\n  The QUALAS measures have been adapted for pediatric, adolescent, and adult populations and include a measure of bowel and bladder function.\n  Measures of continence in BBD have also been validated in the spina bifida population.\n\n\nMeasures in Complex Urologic Conditions\n\nDifferences in Sexual Development\n\nOne valid, disease-specific measure of HRQoL exists in the DSD population.17 This included a battery of measures, include a proxy measure for child experiences (QOL-DSD-Proxy), and the parent self-report form (QoL-DSD-Parent). The authors found that, due to the heterogeneity of the conditions represented, validity was limited for specific sub-domains of HRQoL such as physical functioning, based upon the variety of subtypes of DSD syndromes. Other assessments using informal or generic measures have explored psychosocial and psychosexual health, gender expression, concerns about the future, parental stress, and the effects of communication approaches by the healthcare team.73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90\n\nAnorectal Malformations\n\nThe Hirschsprung’s Disease/Anorectal Malformation Quality of Life Questionnaire (HAQL) is the only disease-specific, valid measure developed for this population. Domains assessed included a type of diet, diarrhea, constipation, fecal continence, urinary continence, emotional functioning, social functioning, body image, physical symptoms, and sexual functioning.42,40,91 Generic and informal measures of QoL also suggest that continence is closely tied to psychosocial and emotional outcomes.67,91\n\nExstrophy/Epispadias\n\nOnly one standardized measure was developed and never validated in this population.92 Social and emotional were found to be related worry about peers discovering their primary condition. Generic measures have found that pelvic organ prolapse correction is critical to overall QoL,93 and that the condition of exstrophy negative affects psychosocial and sexual interactions.94,95,96,97\n\nKey Points: PROs in Complex Urologic Conditions\n\n\n  One valid measure exists for DSD and one for Anorectal Malformations.\n  Several informal surveys have been used in conjunction with generic measures to assess psychosexual development and function in children and adults with DSD, cloacal anomalies, and exstrophy/epispadias.\n\n\nFuture Directions\n\nPROs in Pediatric Urology have evolved to encompass common conditions, such as bowel and bladder dysfunction, to very specific conditions, such as DSD. Existing measures provide important information to providers about how better to support our patients throughout the course of their care for a specific disease. The most psychometrically robust measures are found in bowel and bladder dysfunction and spina bifida, while ongoing work is being done to provide similarly rigorous measures in hypospadias, DSD, and exstrophy. Often, our existing work is limited by the lack of an overarching conceptual model, which should help with the creation of comprehensive, clinically meaningful measures that allow us to closely monitor patient outcomes. Another challenge is finding an efficient way to administer and interpret measures in day-to day practice for the clinical care and research. While electronic administration outside of the hospital setting would permit more people to complete the PROs,98 ensuring access to such resources for all patients could be challenging. Additional work has suggested that patients who are economically disadvantaged or from a minority population may have more difficulty completing PROs, likely due to limited resources.99 Understanding how to equitably, efficiently, and meaningfully capture the patient experience remains a focus of ongoing work.\n\nTo date, much of the work focusing on PRO in pediatric urology has focused on QoL and functional scores. Emerging research is focused on identifying the lived experience of patients and patient priorities during their care for a variety of diseases.100 This process involves obtaining extensive input from patients and families on their experiences, also known as the identification of “stakeholders.” Patient advocacy, with the identification of such stakeholders on the patient and provider level, will help tailor the creation of measures for PROs, and will also help providers take action to support patient priorities. These efforts will likely change the shared-decision making model of care to a patient-prioritized model of care, with a focus on patient-prioritized outcomes, rather than simply patient-reported outcomes.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nPROs have provided valuable information to pediatric urologists about a variety of urologic conditions and have the power to inform both the medical and surgical treatment of urologic disease. Future studies focusing on patient-prioritized medicine will yield more rigorous and clinically valuable measures that enhance the provider’s ability to provide individualized care.\n\nReferences\n\n\nH.

This is also possible via journal subscriptions either personal or institutional and textbooks of pediatric urology which are updated every few years.\n\nUnfortunately not all of us are blessed with the facilities or the time that is required to keep abreast of developments in the field of pediatric urology in a timely fashion. Furthermore in many parts of the world, financial expenses to achieve this can be prohibitive.\n\nWhat better way to achieve all these aims than with a pediatric urology online resource that is free, has open access and where all chapters and subsections are written by leaders in that particular field. Furthermore, the chapters will be updated several times a year keeping the readers up to date from the comfort of their own computer, smartphone or tablet.\n\nThe Pediatric Urology Book has been divided into several sections. In each section, the chapter has been divided into subsections, each subsection being contributed by a specialist. For example, the urolithiasis chapter may have a section written by a nephrologist, an interventional radiologist and a pediatric urologist thereby giving the most comprehensive details for that particular section. In addition where relevant, photographs and video clips will be embedded in the chapter for viewing via the standard means.\n\nHow Did We Self-Publish?\n\nSelf-publishing is not for the faint of heart. You need someone with knowledge of the internet (web servers, hosting services, domain names, HTML, CSS, Javascript) and frameworks to string it all together (Git, GitHub, Bootstrap, JQuery, Ruby, PanDoc, CSL, and a sprinkling of Perl and Python).\n\nSome key open source projects helped get this over the finish line:\n\n  AnyStyle.io (parsed the raw references from authors’ original submissions)\n  doi4bib (allowed us to find and locate DOI and PubMed links for references)\n  CiteProc-Ruby (allowed us to display the references in a pretty format)\n  Porto Website Template (gives the website visual structure)\n  Jekyll (truly the glue for the project, bringing together all the content into the final website)\n\n\nOther tools used in the making of this book:\n\n  Sketch\n  Poppins font\n  Nova\n\n\nWho We Are\n\nWe the editors are all experienced pediatric urologists with a number of peer reviewed publications, chapters in textbooks and editorial responsibility for textbooks and journals to our credit. The belief that “Knowledge should be free” is common to all and with this in mind, we along with our contributors aim to spread this knowledge in pediatric urology in an open online format that is exciting and (still) revolutionary since version 1 came out in 2010. Of course continual improvement is the key to continued success and we would therefore be indebted for your feedback. We certainly could not have done this without the support and advice from our families.\n\nWhile all information on this website is freely available and open access, the editors would request that individuals exercise courtesy to the contributors in obtaining the necessary permissions to use any images or digital material from this work.\n\nAll the best,\nAngela Arlen, PJ López, Mohan Gundeti, &amp; Kyle Rove\n",

        "title": "Conflict of Interest",
        "content": "Conflict of Interest\n\nPrinciples\n\nWe the editors recognize the need for a conflict of interest (COI) policy to establish trust with a broad audience. This will help to foster proper balance, independence, objectivity and scientific rigor in the content of Pediatric Urology Book. Careful compliance and transparency by editors and contributors will inspire confidence, will avoid both actual bias and the appearance of bias, and will comply with legal and regulatory standards.\n\nWe recognize that professionals—especially those involved in clinical care, leadership positions, policy-making, research, education, standard-setting, fundraising or outreach for a professional organization—are subject to COIs. Therefore, we consider it unwise to embrace a general policy which would prevent participation by individuals having relationships which may represent COIs. The existence of an actual or apparent COI does not imply fault or wrongdoing on the part of an individual.\n\nOur policy requires disclosure of financial or intellectual relationships which may be regarded as possibly influencing the work of editors or contributors. Relationships that may create a conflict of interest must be disclosed regardless of whether or not compensation was received. The potential for a conflict arises from the existence of the relationship not the monetary value. Relationships that may give rise to conflict of interest may be of a personal nature or through a family member. All relationships should be disclosed.\n\nWe require that all editors maintain annual updates to their COI disclosure using the appropriate disclosure form, and all contributors must provide complete disclosure prior to publication or major revision (at discretion of the editors) of any content contribution to Pediatric Urology Book. All conflicts of interest will be published and updated below along with date of last update.\n\nTime Horizon\n\nAny COI disclosure will cover the previous 12 months. COI updates will be requested with any major updates to a contribution by the authors.\n\nTypes of COI\n\nCOI can fall into different categories. Sometimes, a specific relationship or disclosure may fall under more than one category. In these instances, the disclosure can be reported only once. Personal financial or intellectual relationships and those of immediate household family members should be disclosed.\n\nResearch activities\n\nThis would encompass any research performed as investigator for commercial or non-commercial entities, including grant support or other sponsorship from said entities.\n\nInvestments\n\nThis category covers personal or family stock ownership, dividends, or revenue received from commercial interests providing healthcare or services. (Passive stock ownership via mutual funds is not required to be disclosed.)\n\nEmployment\n\nAny salaries from any commercial or non-commercial entity, including any publishing, internet, e-commerce or other business enterprise that provides healthcare products or services should be disclosed under this category.\n\nExpert Witness\n\nParticipation as an expert medical testimony for a trial, hearing, deposition, affidavit or any other type of legal proceeding should be disclosed.\n\nSpeaker / Lecturer\n\nHonoraria or reimbursements received as faculty members, speakers’ bureau, industry-sponsored lecture, presenters, chairs, proctors, or consultants must be listed.
